Hello!

First of all i want to thank for all the feedback i received in these 6 months, it helped more than it actually looks like. Really. Along with feedback i want to thank users who contributed financially, with their time and most important these who provided rare/unique book scans.

From the previous update (December 2020) the library got an huge overhault and i strongly suggest you to delete anything you've might have downloaded and just go straight with this one:

* All the books have been named according to a standard, for an easy search. Some books still do have a long path name
* Found hundreds of books that were only available as scan
* Replaced thousands of books with proper retail
* Removed cheap publishers (Charles River Editors, Hourly History..) // books widely available for free (ie Gutenberg)


From December 2021 the goal is to release a main library and update it further with smaller packages.

Legend:
[Retail] - Books that I have obtained myself and removed the DRM
[Retail WM] - Books that I have obtained myself, have the DRM removed but have a watermark on it
(Retail) - Books downloaded from a private tracker and are perfect retail
(retail) - Books downloaded from other sources tagged as retail (DRM might have been removed without calibre..)
[Missing] - Forthcoming books or books that weren't available at the moment of the compilation of this collection.
[Scan, Missing] - No digital version available
[Unpublished, Missing] - Publisher didn't release the book. No version available at all.

[Complete] - All the books have been found
â€  Series terminated or discontinued by the publisher

.TXT files are used just as placeholder for forthcoming/missing books


Large series such as Routledge Variorum Collected Studies (over 1000 books), Medieval & Renaissance Texts & Studies (over 500 books) are still incomplete, i'll give it a proper look for the next release.

Few series such as Routledge Key Guides and Routledge Revivals have a wide range of topics which I did not include in this collection as they are totally unrelated.


What you can expect on the next release (due Christmas 2021) is 

* Further replacement of non-retail with proper retails
* Polishing the series and finding as many [Missing] and Scans as possible
* Overall editing
* I'm planning to pay users to provide scans of missing books, here any contribute is really welcome.
* Shortening books names. This will hurt me more than anything but i have to do it. Or try.

Nevertheless any kind of help, suggestion or just a note on typos is more than appreciate.


Last but not least we created a discord group, don't expect there to be much, we use it as feedback for the collections :)

Enjoy!
