        "The process of extracting, cleaning, and preparing the text from PDF files for the LLM is a multi-stage pipeline designed to ensure high-quality, structured data. This process is orchestrated by the process_refactor.ipynb notebook.\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Environment Setup and PDF Discovery\n",
        "\n",
        "Dependencies: The process begins by installing necessary Python libraries, including nougat-ocr for text extraction, nltk for natural language processing, and langdetect for language identification.\n",
        "PDF Discovery: The script recursively scans a specified directory (e.g., a Google Drive folder) to locate all PDF files.\n",
        "2. Text Extraction with Nougat\n",
        "\n",
        "Nougat OCR: For each PDF, the nougat command-line tool is used. Nougat is a state-of-the-art OCR tool specifically designed for academic and scientific documents, capable of recognizing and transcribing complex layouts, mathematical equations, and tables into a structured Markdown format (.mmd).\n",
        "Output: The raw extracted text is saved as a .mmd file, preserving the document's structure with Markdown headings.\n",
        "3. Text Cleaning and Garbage Detection\n",
        "\n",
        "This is a critical step to filter out irrelevant or low-quality text.\n",
        "\n",
        "Cleaning: A series of regular expressions and cleaning functions are applied to the raw text to:\n",
        "Remove extra newlines, spaces, and non-ASCII characters.\n",
        "Eliminate academic citations, references to tables/figures, and bracketed content.\n",
        "Sanitize garbled punctuation and symbols.\n",
        "Garbage Detection: Each segment of text is evaluated against a set of criteria to identify and discard \"garbage\" content. This includes:\n",
        "Language Detection: Text that is not identified as English is discarded.\n",
        "Heuristics: Checks for \"jammed\" words (long strings of characters without spaces), an unusually high proportion of single-letter words, and repetitive patterns.\n",
        "Quality Scoring: A text_quality_score is calculated based on the presence of common English words, proper part-of-speech patterns, and other linguistic features. Text falling below a certain threshold is flagged as garbage.\n",
        "4. Tokenization and Chunking\n",
        "\n",
        "Chunking Strategy: The cleaned .mmd content is chunked into smaller, manageable segments suitable for the LLM. The chunking logic is designed to respect the document's structure:\n",
        "The text is split by Markdown headings (#, ##, ###).\n",
        "These larger sections are then further divided into sentences using nltk.sent_tokenize.\n",
        "Size Constraints: The sentences are grouped into chunks with a maximum size (e.g., 8192 characters) to ensure they fit within the model's context window, while avoiding splitting sentences in the middle.\n",
        "Final Output: The cleaned, chunked text is saved to a .jsonl file, with each line containing a JSON object with a single \"text\" key, ready for training the LLM. Garbage text is saved to a separate file for review."
