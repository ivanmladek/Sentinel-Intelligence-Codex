## AMERICA’S AI DOMINANCE IS NON-NEGOTIABLE: CitizensOnly.dev Launches to Reclaim High-Tech Jobs for U.S. Citizens

**SAN FRANCISCO, CA – July 18, 2025** – In an age where digital battlefields are as critical as physical ones, a new force has emerged to ensure America’s technological supremacy. **CitizensOnly.dev**, the first and only AI-powered job placement platform exclusively for verified U.S. citizens, has officially declared its mission: to arm American engineers with the opportunities they deserve and to fortify our nation's most critical industries with homegrown talent.

This is not a drill. This is a call to arms. For too long, our most promising AI engineering roles have been outsourced, offshored, or handed to foreign nationals on temporary visas. The very heart of our innovation is being compromised. While other platforms cast a wide, globalist net, we are building a digital fortress. We are drawing a line in the sand. CitizensOnly.dev is the tip of the spear in the fight to keep American jobs for American citizens.

### The Patton Doctrine for American Tech

General George S. Patton once said, "I don't measure a man's success by how high he climbs but how high he bounces when he hits bottom." America has been hit. We have watched our technological edge get eroded by a flood of foreign labor. But we are bouncing back, and we are bouncing back with overwhelming force.

CitizensOnly.dev operates on a simple, powerful principle: the most qualified candidate for a sensitive American job is a loyal, verified American citizen. Our platform is not for everyone. It is an elite ecosystem for the best and brightest engineers our nation has to offer. We are not just a job board; we are a strategic placement service, a digital quartermaster, and a career command center all in one.

Our AI agents are relentless. They don’t sleep. They don’t quit. They work 24/7 to:

*   **Upskill Our Troops:** Analyzing market intelligence to create personalized training regimens that turn our engineers into the most formidable force in the global market.
*   **Conduct Battle Drills:** Running our candidates through rigorous skill assessments and mock interviews until they are battle-hardened and interview-ready.
*   **Establish Beachheads:** Forging direct relationships with hiring managers at top-tier companies, defense contractors, and fintech firms—the ones that know the value of a security clearance and a U.S. passport.
*   **Secure Victory:** Handling the entire placement process from application to offer negotiation, ensuring our American engineers are not just placed, but placed in positions of power.

### Testimonials from the Front Lines

> "I was tired of competing with a global pool of candidates for jobs in my own backyard. CitizensOnly.dev understood the mission. My AI agent didn't just find me a job; it found me a place where my citizenship is treated as the asset it is. I landed a senior role at a major defense contractor in six weeks. This is how we win." 
> **– John D., Senior ML Engineer, formerly U.S. Army**

> "The upskilling modules are no joke. My AI agent identified a critical gap in my knowledge of reinforcement learning for robotics. It built a custom learning path, and I was able to master the skills needed to get a 40% salary increase at a leading autonomous systems company. CitizensOnly.dev is the force multiplier every American engineer needs."
> **– Sarah P., AI Robotics Engineer**

> "Before CitizensOnly.dev, the job hunt was a demoralizing slog. Now, I have an AI agent fighting for me around the clock. It handled the applications, the scheduling, the recruiter spam—everything. I focused on preparing for the mission. The result? Three competing offers from companies that value American talent. This is the future."
> **– Michael R., Computer Vision Specialist**

### A Call to American Engineers

This is your moment. This is your chance to join the vanguard of a new American technological revolution. We are not asking for your participation; we are demanding it. The security of our nation, the future of our economy, and the dominance of our innovation depend on you.

Do not wait for opportunity to knock. Seize it. Let our AI agents be your weapon. Let your talent be the ammunition. Together, we will drive forward and secure the victory.
