## Citizens.Only Launches to Secure America’s AI Talent Pipeline

**SAN FRANCISCO, CA – July 18, 2025** – A new, mission-driven platform, **Citizens.Only**, launched today to address a critical vulnerability in the U.S. tech industry. It is the first AI-powered placement platform exclusively for verified U.S. citizens in AI and Machine Learning, creating a secure talent pipeline for companies working on sensitive and mission-critical projects.

Citizens.Only was founded on the principle that national security and economic competitiveness depend on trusted, homegrown engineering talent. The platform directly connects pre-vetted American engineers with top-tier companies, defense contractors, and financial institutions that require security clearance eligibility and have stringent data security protocols.

"We are not a conventional job platform; we are a strategic talent partner," said the founding team. "Our focus is singular: to ensure that the most critical AI roles in this country are filled by the most reliable and qualified candidates—U.S. citizens."

The platform's AI-driven agent provides a decisive advantage for American engineers by:

*   **Continuously Upskilling:** Identifying and closing skill gaps with personalized training paths to keep them ahead of market demands.
*   **Enforcing Rigorous Preparation:** Conducting regular skill assessments and mock interviews to ensure candidates are technically sharp and fully prepared.
*   **Securing Strategic Placement:** Automating the entire application and interview process, from initial contact to offer negotiation, allowing engineers to focus on their craft.

For companies, Citizens.Only offers unparalleled access to a pre-vetted, elite pool of American AI talent, drastically reducing time-to-hire and mitigating insider risk.

**About Citizens.Only:**

Citizens.Only is a high-security, AI-powered career platform dedicated to placing verified U.S. citizen engineers in critical AI and ML roles. Our mission is to strengthen America's technological sovereignty by building a trusted, elite workforce.
