Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my enthusiastic interest in the Member of Technical Staff, AI Data position at Microsoft AI, which I discovered via Eightfold. My extensive experience in designing and building large-scale, multimodal data pipelines for training large language models, along with my passion for the pivotal role of data in AI, aligns perfectly with the requirements of this role.

At SpaceKnow Inc., I led the development of a distributed data pipeline for LLM pretraining, processing terabytes of text and image data. This experience has provided me with a deep understanding of the challenges involved in building and maintaining the cutting-edge infrastructure required to support large-scale AI models. I am adept at the craftsmanship and attention to detail required to handle petabytes of data and enjoy the challenge of rigorous experimentation to refine data recipes.

Furthermore, my work on the open-source project `CinderellaAI` demonstrates my ability to build end-to-end generative AI systems, from speech-to-text and text-to-speech to local, on-device inference. This project highlights my hands-on experience with the multi-modal data (text, audio, images) that your team is focused on.

I thrive in highly collaborative, fast-paced environments and am eager to contribute to the development of generative AI at Microsoft. I am confident that my skills, proactive attitude, and enthusiasm for exploring new technologies would make me a valuable asset to your team.

My resume is attached for your review, and I look forward to the opportunity to discuss my qualifications with you further.

Sincerely,
Pavel Machalek
