Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my keen interest in the AI Research/Machine Learning Engineer position at Perplexity. My experience in designing and building large-scale data pipelines for LLM pretraining, particularly my work on high-throughput scraping systems using Playwright and RedisBloom at SpaceKnow Inc., aligns directly with the needs of your Agent Products.

My background in developing and deploying machine learning models, from privacy risk scoring engines to geospatial analytics platforms, has given me a deep understanding of the entire ML lifecycle. I am particularly drawn to the challenge of creating autonomous, tool-using agents, and I am confident that my experience with frameworks like AutoGPT and my expertise in Python, PyTorch, and TensorFlow would be a valuable asset to your team.

I am excited by Perplexity's mission to build a trustworthy AI-powered answer engine and am eager to contribute to the development of your advanced retrieval and agent-based products. My resume is attached for your review, and I look forward to the opportunity to discuss my qualifications with you further.

Sincerely,
Pavel Machalek
