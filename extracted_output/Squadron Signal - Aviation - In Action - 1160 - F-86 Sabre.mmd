The end of the Second World War brought an immediate (and controversial) influx of jet technology from Germany. As rapidly as advances were made in engine technology, however, the speed potential seemed to stabilize at about 600 mph. Spomething was needed to bring airframe technology in line with the power plants. Captured German documents, translated by Larry Green, NANAS Head of Design Aerodynamics, including running wind tunnel data, clearly showed the speed benefit of swept using surfaces.

In September of 1948, NANA engineer Harrison Storms studied the results of Green's research and thought it might be incorporated into the XP-86 proposal. The German wind tunnel tests revealed compressibility drag was delayed through the use of swept wings. Storms' swept wing XP-86 was estimated to be about 75 mph faster than the straightup XP-86. There were problems with the use of swept wing including a loss in speed by nanojecting characteristics, but a further study of German research revealed that movable leading edge devices, called slats, that extended into the airstream improved low speed handling.

Storms'new wing with its 35 degree sweep and full span leading edgeal was was fitted to the redesigned XP-86 model and (steel in NANAs low speed wind tunnel. The swept wing exhibited satisfactory tail characteristics when inlet with the leading edge slats and gave the XP-86 an estimated spot speed of over 650 mph. As a result, the USAARF under the prototypes in November of 1945.

The first XP-86 prototype (45-9597) took slightly over eighteen months to complete and rolled out at NANAS Infeed plant on 8 August 1947. The prototype emerged as a sleck lowing aircraft with speed huge wings and tail surfaces, with little resemblance to its contemporaeus, such as the Ap-80, P-84 and P-FF. Nort who was the airframe a radical departure from any other aircraft in production, the XP-86 also incorporated two major structural innovations. First was the use of tapered skinning and the second was the use of a double skin structure rather than a conventional wind and stronger constriction. This provided added strength and allowed enough open area in the wing for fuel tanks.

The XP-86 looked fast -- and it lived up to its looks. After extensive ground testing, NANA test pilot George "Shethaus" Welch lifted the XP-86 of the dry lake bed at Muroce in 1 October 1947, Flight tests revealed that the XP-86 was all that the Air Force had hoped for. The greatest advantage of the swept wing was its low drag at high Mach numbers. This meant that thrust that was needed to reach these speeds with a straight wing aircraft could now be used for combat maneuvering. It was found that the swept wing actually had a higher lift factor than a larger straightup wing design at high Mach numbers. This meant that Sabre pilot could keep the Mach number high in a driving turn where lift is usually a limiting factor with a straight wing. The XP-86 was designed with a set of speed brakes in the rear lestage, two on the fusefine sides and one, large brake under the fusefine. These brakes could be opened in any attitude and speed, including at or above Mach One. No other fighter had such a braking system.

Tests showed that the XP-86 was 75 mph faster than a windup else in service. The XP-86 wasn just a fast aircraft. The leading edgeal stools could be used to lessen turn rate and an advantage over one enemy. It was a "plots" spline. If the XP-86 went out of control, the pilot need only to release the stick and the XP-86 would stabilize, if you had the altitude. One of the things pilots liked about the airplane wasting great vision through the 360 degree bubble camp.

Low speed handling, especially during fixed and landing was still an area of concern, even with full extension of the leading edge slats. If the wing lost lift, no amount of power could keep the XP-86 airborne. The aircraft would perform what was known as the "Sabre dance", during which the aircraft would fominder in the air,aving back and forth on a exhaust plume, usually with fatal results. The answer was more power and forth American re-engined one of the three XP-86 prototypes with the new 5200 lst 447-GE-2-power plant (which was intended for production aircraft) and it was this XP-86 that "Wheethaus" Welch put through the sound barrier on 25 April 1948. With the successful completion of the test program, the Air Force ordered the aircraft into production under the designation F-86A Sabre.

F-86A

The installation of the 47-GE-1-engine was the main difference between the XP-86 prototype and the F-86A production aircraft. The \(M^{2}\)-GE-1 engine was rated at 5,200 post, compared with the 4,000 best available with the J35 engines used in the XP-86s. Installation of the 47 brought the performance of the F-86A-1 into the main change region, with a top speed of over 670 mph. MAJ Robert L. Johnson exhibited this performance when he set a new World Speed Record of 60:98 mph in a production F-86A-1 on 15 Septeler 1948.

Externalised the production of F-86A different only slightly from the XP-86 prototypes. The F-86A-1 was named with six 350 gallover machine guns which had not been installed on the XP-86. The guns were in three-point packs installed on each side of the fuselage nose. The gun ports were covered with electrically operated doors for aerodynamic streamlining and open thermal shower changes the guns were fired. The F-86A was omitted with an ejection set so that the pilot could solely leave a criped F-86 at high speeds. The underfudge broke was eliminated and the fuselage speed reaches now opened rearward instead of forward as on the XP-86s.

The F-86A-5 was the first combat-capable variant. It differed from the F-86A-1 in having a V-shaped,armed glass unforesh and heated gun compartments. It also was the first F-86 equipped with an underhang y/o capable of carrying a variety of ordinance, including 500 and 1,000 ground bombs and underhang for just to 208 gall. Additionally the F-86A-5 could carry 5 inch HVAR rockets on such launchers under the guns. Power was upgraded through the installation of the 7-engine and later the -13 engine. Both were still rated at 5,200 lst, but they were more reliable and easier to maintain.

**Fusealge Development**Most of the thirty-three F-86A-1s were used for test and evaluation purposes and it was the F-86A-5 that was the first to see squadron service. The 1st Fighter Group at March AF was the first operational unit, transforming from Lockheed-F-80s into F-80A-5s during February of 1949. The 1st F6 was charged with the art defenses for the Los Angeles area, which included the North American plant where their aircraft were built. The next flighter groups to become operational with the F-86A-8s were the 4th FG at Langley AFB which defended the nation's capital and the 81st FG at Kirkland AFB, that covered the atom bomb plant at Jammonow, New Mexico. In all, the VIAF fighter groups were equipped with F-86A-8s. The Air Force accepted 554F at 86-86A s at a cost of 5178,408,00 each. The first Sabres that went to reverse turns were assigned to the 16th FIS/Washington ANG which transitioned to F-86A on 22 December 1950.

Of the five operational groups, it was the 4th flighter Interceptor Group that became the most famous at its area that is the 4th that took theague to war. When the Communist Air Forces Introduced the 4th-15-1 inch to the air war over Korea in November of 1950, they immediately made all the flighter aircraft that the Shi Air Force had in the theater obsolete. The Mid of each eight air air superimptly anywhere they chose to appear. The 82-force wholes happiness against MG attacks and 5th AF F-80 showing Stars could collide stop blocks from getting the B-29s. The MSG was almost 75 mph faster than the F-80C. Had the Red portends moved the Mid force in Korea behind their successful ground offinsive in the Winter of 1950. It would have made things much more interesting.

But the light didn't and FAF required the Mid's therapy waking for, and receiving the best aircraft available in the US: inventory -- the F-86A-8s' Subre. The Air Force immediately dispatched the 4th FG to Korea with their F-86A-8s.

It would not be the last, as Sabre pilots would rack up 791 more MIG victories before the end of the Korean Police Action in July of 1953.

There were several modifications made to the F-86A during its service life. Problems in Korea led to a replacement of the M.18 gyroscopic guntshift with an A-1CM sight that was linked to the AN/APG-30/rad built within the lip of the inestime. Several model48 F-86A that were in Korea with the 4th Feighter Interceptying Wing were converted to reconnaissance aircraft. The aircraft were floors up to the Rear Echeton Maintenance Right/ENROLANDed MIGs, Japan for Project ASHRAF. The ASHRAF conversion included the removal of the gun system and ammunition supply bays and installation of a pair of K-2 cameras housed in a budget fitting under the fuselage where the among bays had once been.

The cameras were mounted on a horizontal axis, which aimed them at a mirror for vertical coverage. The mirror mounting was quite crude and thimsy and many of the photos came out blurred due to camera and/or mirror vibration. But forward the project as a success.

By the end of the water test was seen at the right border to be RF-86A standards. Several had a "dining" camera fitted in the lip of the nose where the gun-sight radar had been mounted. These cameras were covered with small sliding doors. Some RF-86A retained two of their 50 caliber gans (with a very limited amount of ammunition for self-defense. Although the RF-86A project was a field modification done for a combat requirement (and strictly a temporary design until RF-86A's could be delivered) North American did build several RF-86A's firstly for use in Korea. All the RF-86A Sabre missions in Korea were (from) by 15th TRB pilots.

## Appendix F-86b

The F-86B was a modification of the original F-86A with larger wheels, tires and heavier brakes which would have meant an additional seven inches added to the width of the fuselage. Air For stronger signaled at different intercity biqu 190F-86BMs [1947]; however, and brake technology advanced to such a point that the original tire/bake size requirements were retained and the order was altered to 188 F-86As and two F-86Cs, No prototype F-86Bs were ever built.

The first operational unit to re-equil with F-86A was the 1st Fighter Group at March AFB, California reached the first States in March of 1948. The rounded windscreen was only on the F-86A-1. The Winstinst scanning, the path ports for the 50 caliber machine guns were covered by automatically opening doors. (USAF)

F-86C/YF-93A

The F-86C was designed around a requirement for a long range fighter aircraft to escort SAC bombers to Soviet targets. It retained the swept wing planform of the F-86A Sabe but had an entirely new fuselage and engine. Power front TF-86C was thus more common from a 8000 best Praft & Whitney 448-P-1 engine with an afterburner. The larger 48s engine meant that the fuselage had to be enlarged both in width and length. The F-86C was forty-four feet long, some six and a half feet longer than an F-86A and much wider. The immense fuselage was fitted with additional fuel tanks that brought the total fuel capacity to 1.580 gallos.

The F-86C was armed with six 20mM cannons and had an SCR-720 search radar housed in the nose radome. With the nose now housing the radar, the F-86C had the air intakes repositioned to the sides of the fuselage using NACA-designed recessed air scoops. The fuselage also utilized the new area rule "coke bottle" shape. This pinched or "Wasp waist" design reduced drag at high Mach numbers and would be used on most of the Century Series Bithers during the 19SOs. The dive brakes were replaced by a large slab brake mounted under the fuselage (very similar to that found on the later F-100).

All these changes to the airframe led the Air Force to redesignate the aircraft the 93A. Rollout of the YF-93A came in late 1949, with the first flight taking place on 24 January 1950. The weight of the YF-93A was over 26,500 pounds in combat trim, almost twice that of the F-86A. But the 8,000 best 148 engine, combined with all the low-drag design features, led to a surprising top speed of 708 mph. Range on internal fuel was almost 2,000 miles, compared with a Jerry range of 1,052 miles for the standard F-86A (with external fuel tanks).

Two YF-93As were built (48-317 and 48-318) and late in their service lives, both YF-93 has their air intakes redesigned with a conventional protruding scoupd extending over the NACA flush intakes. The YF-93A was used to compete against the Lockheed F-90 for the "penetration fighter" to escort SAC bombers to Soviet targets. But development of long range jet bombers, the B-47 and B-5, with their very high speed, eliminated the need for a penetration fighter. As a result, both fighter projects were cancelled and the funds used to purchase more bombers. At some point in their service with NACA, both YF-93As had the rear faselage modified to accept a production F-86C tailpipe and stabilizer housing. The YF-93As were used by NACA as flighttest and chase aircraft well into the mid-19SOs.

F-86L

The F-86L was not a new production aircraft but rather a rebuild of existing F-86D airframes modified with several totally new systems. The wing was replaced with a longer-span, slatter using then in use of the F-864-dry, all the electronics were brought up to the latest "state of the art" technology, including stripping the entire aircraft of its existing wiring and replacing it with all new wiring. A new electronic data-link between the air defense ground controller and the pitbo was added to the aircraft. It was known as the SAGE system (Semi-Automatic Ground Environment). The SAGE equipment allowed the interceptor pilot instant access to any and information available from the ground controller. SAGE equipment included an AN/AR6-3 data link receiver, AN/AR6-3 command radio, AN/AR6-3 classification tradar and a new glidge slope receiver. The SAGE antenna under the forward leakage was the main external difference between the F-86D and F-86L.

The SAGE equipment was used into the F-4 Fire Control System and automatically computed the proper read-collision attack course. These modifications were conducted under Project FOLLOW ON at the North American facilities at high-head and Fresno, California. The first flight of the F-86L took place in late Spring 1936, with the 40th FIS taking delivery of the first operational F-86L in October. The flagwood plant modified 575 late production F-86Ds the last F-86D came off the assembly line in September of 1955 to F-86L standards, with the Fresno plant doing an additional 452 aircraft. The Air Force accepted a total of 827 F-86L's by the time the program ended.

F-86F

The F-86F was the ultimate clear air, day fighter variant of the Sabre. It was built in four basic sub-types -- narrow chord wing with Leading Edge Slats (LES), "6-3 wing" with fences, with atomic capabilities, and with extended span wingwith LLES. One of the biggest rings that combat pilots in Korea had about the Sabre was its lack of engine power. It was a great flying aircraft and very safe with its armored cockpit and backup systems. But all these safety additions means that added weight and added weight meant a decided disadvantage with the MIG in rate of climb and service ceiling. As a result, General Electric began a development program with the non-afterbethung 34f which resulted in the 5,910B Inst4-GCE-27 engine. The increase in power raised the rate of climb to 390 f/min. Although still less than the MIG-15.6 it did make the Sabre pilots more competitive against the Soviet fighter. Top speed also increased with a sea level of 693 mph. With the F-86F-10, a new A-4 radar ranging gunst was added to the fire control system.

The F-86F-25 variant is regarded by many as the ultimate day fighter of the early 1950s. Initially the F-86F-25 and -30-we simple modifications with an additional hard point added to each wing for carriage of a second drop tank for 1,000 pumph bonds. Butin August of 1952, North American Aviation engineers tested a new wing design. The wing chord was extended as silicos that are not the root and three inches at the unight. The extension was done on the wing leading edge, and at the same time, the leading edge slats were removed and replaced with a fixed leading edge. A small wing air flow fence was also added to the wing (approximately seventh percent of the span). This fence helped guide airflow over the wing and reduced transaction buffet. The result -- a tighter turning radius at high Mach numbers.

Sabre pilots now had an aircraft that could easily out dive the MIG, could now turn with and inside the MIG and had almost as great a rate of climb. The MIG will had atitude advantage, which saved a lot of them from destruction in Korea. With all the other advantages the Sabre pilot had (self-seiling fuel tanks, armored cockpit, radar gun lights and much better training) -- the result in combat was predictable. In May and June of 1953, Sabre pilots, most of them flying new F-86FFs, slow down a total of 133 MIGs for the loss of one Sabre. Most of the credit has to go to the Sabre pilots who took full advantage of all the new modifications to the aircraft.

The final two major daylight-fiber sub-variants were the F-86F-35 and F-86F-40. The F-35 featured the Low Atlantic Bonding System (LARS) which was capable of "followthing" a small atomic weapon. The F-86F-40 was a development for the Japanese Air Self Defense Force while featured the 6-3 wing. The 6-3 wing was fitted with leading edge slats and a one detection at the wing. The longer wing with slats made for a very stable aircraft at low speeds, which was needed for all the Military Assistance Program pilots from national air over the world that were going to be equipped with Sabres of various types. This F-40 wing was also adopted by the USAF for the Sabres used at the Nellis AFB Fisher School for training both U.S. and foreign pilots.

At the peak of their service, the USAF had sixteen wings equipped with the F-86F. North American Aviation built a total of 1,959 F-86F as it a fly-away cost of 512,111.00 each. In addition to the North American total, Mitsubishi built another 300 F-86F-40 for the Japanese Air Self Defense Force. Strangely, the F-86F was not phased into Air National Guard service in great numbers. Most F-86F's going into the MDAP inventory were sold to other nations.

F-86H

The last Sabere variant built by North American was the F-86H and it was intended to be the best of the Sabere line. All the previous problems and "needs" were going to be answered with the F-86H. The additional power that Sabere plots carved us answered by installing a 8000 Bost General Electric J173 engine, which required a six inch increase in fuselage depth. The lack of fire power was greatly improved by replacing the six.50 caliber machine gains with four of the newly developed N3920th host speed cannon (although early production F-86H-1s retained the six. 50 caliber gun armament). The F-86H initially had the 6-5's wing with fences, but was later fitted with the F-40 extended wing and eventually duplication F-86H were retrofitted with the F-40 wing. The F-86H was equipped with the LABS system and could carry a 1,2000 "special store" (atomic weapon) on the inboard underharg hard points.

Unfortunately, the airframe itself had reached its limit and no amount of additional power could bring the F-86H into the level supersonic speed range. That fact, plus development of the "Sabere" 65" (I-100 Super Sabere), led to a short production run of only 43 aircraft at (if a) years of 5852.83990 each). Although both of the prototypes (52-1975 and 52-1976) were built in the headwood North American plant, all production aircraft were built at the North American plant in Columbus, Ohio. The first production aircraft were delivered to the 312th FBW at Clovis AFB, NM in the F-1934 while the last F-86H was delivered to the Air Force in October of 1955. F-86H sentiped five USAF fighter-bonner wings in the mid-1950s.

The first F-86H sentiped five already being phased into Air National Guard service by 1957 and by June of 1958, all F-86H senti in active Air Force use had been passed to the ANG, although there was a brief time when a number of the F-86H s were returned to active duty. Damping the 1961 Berlin Crisis, the Air Force accounted the 101st and 131st Tactical Fighter Squadors, Massachusetts Air National Guard, deploying them to Phalsbour Air Base, France where they were mounted until August of 1962.

It was an F-86H saff from the final US/NAF/A Study smoke, when the 138th TFS, New York AN30 phased the Sabere out of service on 30 September 1970. Following phaseout with the Air National Guard, the F-86Hs with the lowest flight hours were made available to the US. Navy. The Navy had a dual use for the Sabere -- as a target from and as a MG simulator in air command training. F-86Hs were used in the Navy TOP GUN program as aggressive aircraft since they were aimed similar size, shapeand performance as the MG17's being encountered by Navy over North Vietnam. More than one Navy TOP GUN F-4 pilot was "killed" by a Sabere. Finally, the F-86Hs were used as target drones for testing advanced air-to-air and surface-to-air systems such as the Phoenix, AMRAM, and Standard missiles.

(John Underwood)F-86K

Another major development in the Sabre line was the Fiat of Italy license-built F-86K. The F-86K model was the answer to a NATO requirement for an all-weather jet intercept to counter the Soviet nuclear bombet threat. Basically the F-86K was an F-86D split to sample by an NATO and other firerolly foreign air forces. The F-86K was armed with uniform M24M20Mannations of the mid-rock entertainment of the F-86D. The F-86K was armed also used in M-46-Free Event System with an optical sensor in place of the much more sophisticated Hughes E-system found on USAF aircraft and the F-86K retained the AN/APO-36 sensor radar used with the F-86D.

Initially, the F-86K was to have followed all the engine changes found in the F-86D program. The Fiat Force, however, was widely decided to use a single power plant, the JA-7G-F-86M for the F-86K, simplifying production. As with the F-86D and F-86K, the F-86K had the array moved with high leakage data sets, but was later retrofitted with the F-40's extended wing, Finally, F-86K and their arrangement upgraded to include an air of Sidiometry at the air-to-air missile in addition to their four enormous.

The first flight of the F-86K prototype took place on Dec 15 July 1954. Both Y-86Ks were converted F-86D-44W (52-360 and 52-380d). Following service tests at EEMARS AFB, both Y-86K were delivered to Fiat Italy. North Americanbuild 120F-86Ks at the Ingeboard plant, which were then disassembled and shipped to Fiat for assembly, while Fiat built another 221 F-86Ks.

The first F-86K system were switched over the 1st _Aerborgria_, Italian Air Force in the late Summer of 1958, NATO at five strongest duperthier and F-86K included the Italian, French, Federal German, Dutch and Turkish air forces, Phasequot of the F-86K began during 1964 when Italian Air Force units began to transition to the Lockheed F-104 Staffighter.

## Korea

Any connection regarding the Sabre automatically leads to the subject of Korea, for it was over Korea that the Sabre proved its metric. What makes the topic even more interesting is that in almost every aspect of air combat with the MG-15, the Sabre was never its equal - yet the results of that Police Action revealed at least a 10-1 kill ratio in favor of the Sabre.

A comparison of the performance characteristics of the MG-15 and the Sabre are extraordinary when in the results of the war. The MG was much smaller and lighter, weighing slightly over 11,000 pounds, compared with the K-684 190,000 pounds. The MG was powered by a Soviet by the SoBose engine, the 5000 ball RD4-3, while the F-86T had the most powerful Sabre engine with 5,930 lbst. The MG and Sabre were roughly comparable in to speed at both sea level and at combat altitudes of 40,000 feet or above. But the lighter weight of the MG gave it inelemonanel at time of only 100,000 hr. The F-86T with the \(m\)-2 gene could most paved 80,000 hr. The Shorts the Sturgs and Meteorius the MG in 1995-2000 ms removed F-86A-86S, both of which had a rate of climb of only 7,400 h/min.

The lightweight MG did had a short 4000 feature in service ceiling, Sabres in Korea were entering MG AIDS at 45,000 feet only to find the MG's above about 100,000 feet when the same was nothing the Sabre pilots could do about it unless the MIGs came down. If they did come down, their advantages started fading rapidly. The Sabre being much heavier than the MIGs, had a much higher diving speed. Both the Sabre and MG could go supersonic in a dive, the Sabre was much more stable air-rich in the dimensionless escape. The MG-15 became quite unstable when entering the transition speeds near Mach One is not uncommon for a Sabre pilot to push a MGG into into the transaction speed era only to see the MGG use the entire vertical tail sheath during violent combat maneuver. The MG was much more maneuverable than the F-86A-86T, and early F-86T. But the later F-86T with the hard wing leading edge and wing hees crossed an advantage.

Armament was a tie with neither having a clear advantage. The MG had much greater brainpower with its twin 22Mst cannons and single 37MxMann. But the cyclic state of these wins was very slow and their amputing supply was low: 160 rounds per coin for the 23MxMann and forty months for the 73MxMann. The 75MxMann.
