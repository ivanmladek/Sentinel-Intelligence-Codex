## Introduction

During 1943, Grumman was producing large numbers of FGF-3 Hellcats for service in the Pacific; however, both Grumman that the Navy realized that, although the FGF was the answer to the Navy's immediate needs, a successor with even higher performance would be required if the war continued. Both Boeing and Curtis had proposed fighter designs to replace the Hellcat that were both larger and heavier than the FGF. Boeing had submitted the XF8B-1, while the entry from Curtis was designated the XF4C-14.

During this same time, Grumman engineering test pilot Bob Hall was sent to England to test fly and evaluate a captured German Focke Wall'190 lighter. He was so impressed with the lightweight German fighter that he hurried back to report to Leroy (Roy) Grumman, founder and president of Grumman.

His reports convinced Grumman that their entry in the competition for an FGF successor should be as small, light weight fighter, designed for optimum performance. From the outset, Roy Grumman took a strong interest in Design 58. The aircraft was to be his "hot" road - the personally sent the design criteria for the new fighter. It was to be small, light weight, highly maneuverable and with enough power to ensure that its performance would exceed anything from under design at that time. On 28 July 1943, in a memo to the slister designer, Bill November, Grumman outlined the design's specification.

Closked in wartime secrecy, Schwender and his design team took Roy Grumman's memo and ran with it. It was decided that Design 58 would be powered by the proven 1200 hr Praft A Whitney R-2800 Double Waynal engine. The flight would use the Helest's MACA 230 aircraft and would feature a first for Navy flighters a full-blown bubble canopy, which would give the pilot excellent visibility in all directions.

On 29 November 1943, the Navy awarded Grumman a contract (NOa(s)2416) for two prototypes under the designation XF8F-1. The Grumman experimental shop set took work and built the two prototypes in order. In this first prototype being rolled out of the experimental shop on 21 August 1944. The aircraft emerged as all metal, stressed skin fighter with a semi-monocouge fuselage. The fuselage utilized flush viewing and spot welding, and featured a heavy gauge 302 W aluminum alloy skin, which gave the XF8F-1 prototype the smoothest finish of any US. US. With 1617.

Every effort had been made to save weight, and while armor protection was provided for the pilot, engine and oil cooler, the internal fuel capacity was limited to 160 gallons as a weight saving measure. The landing engine, fang, olioi cooler doors and gun charges were hydraulically operated, the lithodox and wing told mechanisms we manually operated, while the cowl lfay were electrical. Trim thus served provided for the fabric covered under, elevators and alternons. The proposed armament was 50 caliber Browning machine guns in each wing, mounted between the landing gear and the wing fold.

The Navy wanted the first XF8F-1 powered by the readily available 2,100 hp Pratt & Whitney R-2800-22W engine with a two-speed supercharger and the second to be powered by the new "E series R-2800-300W at variable speed supercharger. The 300 engine was not available and both XF8F-1 were powered by the R-2800-22W engine driving a 1260 f 7 inch diameter, four blade Aeroproducts Model A642-G1 constant-speed propeller.

The large propeller dictated that the landing gear legs had to be long. To give the necessary length, and still allow the landing gear to be retracted into a well enclosed totally in the wing, the hydraulically operated landing gear featured an articulated tunnelion. The transition extended the gear legs length in the down position and folded back along the gear leg to shorten the leg to fit into the wheel well. Since the landing gear folded aboard, the long legs produced a wide track, which helped combat torque during takeoff and gave the XF8F-1 good ground handling.

ted the airflow over the top of the wing, inducing turbulence over the tail surfaces. To solve the problem, the outlet was moved to the bottom of the wing. After the modification was made. Hall took the KF87-1 up again. This time he really "waring it out" and returned enthusicath and convinced that Grumman had a winner in the XF87-1.

During the early test flights the prototype demonstrated to speed of 424 mph and a climate rate of 4.800 feet per minute, impressive figures for a substitute engine. The second XF87-1 point (see test program in 2 December 1944. The first KSF87-1 was then flown to analyze Field, Virginia, for wind tuned tests at the Ames wind tunnel. After the wind tunnel tests were completed, the first KSF87-1 was lost when ternished while on the return to be plobting, during March of 1945.

Testing of the second prototype progressed smoothly and during June of 1944, the Navy ordered the XF87-1 into production with an initial order of twenty-three production aircraft (which was handled as an amendment to the original XF87 contract). Following their now established tradition of naming Grumman fighter aircraft with names ending in...the_ New many of the Event. The A second counter (NO3/4/979) was awarded to Grumman for an additional 2000 FNFs under the designation F87-1, with a proposed production rate of 100 per month. The Navy wanted all the FNFs they could possibly get by November of 1945 when Operation OLYMPIC, the invasion of Japan, was scheduled.

Under the production plan, F87-5 Helical production was to be phased out with the F87 going into full production by January of 1946. To augment Grumman production, the Navy turned to Grumman's proven subcontractor, Eastern Aircraft. The extent of General Motors' contribution to the U.S. war effort has never been fully appreciated. GMs Eastern Aircraft division, formed from the East Coast automotive plants tidled by the war, produced 77 percent of the Avener torpedo bomners and 79% of the Wildet fisheries built during W1.

The subcontractor, signed on 5 February 1945, called for production of the FM-2 Wilidet at GMs Linden, New Jersey, plant, to be suspending to favor of production of a total of 1.786 Ebarats (which were to be designated the F3M-1). Eastern was still loosing-up to begin F3M-1 production when the Second World War ended and the contract was cancelled in August of 1945.

F8f-1

Following the completion of the first two XFF-1s, Grumman built the first of the twenty-three initial production aircraft in the experimental shop (BulNo 90437), with the aircraft rolling out 31 December 1948. These aircraft, along with the remaining initial production aircraft which now came out of the main production line, were designated as F8F-1s. Early production F8F-1s were assigned BulNo 90437 to 99461, with the last two numbers, 90469 and 90461, being assigned to the two XFFs.

The production F8F-1 different from the XFF-1 prototypes in a number of ways, to improve direction stability, a dorsal fish was added to the leading edge of the vertical stabilizer, and the span of the horizontal stabilizer was increased by twelve inches to improve longitudinal stability. Because of delays with the R-2800-30W engines, product-of-rest were powered by the 2,100 ph (2,400 ph with water injection) R-2800-3W engines.

Some of the earliest problems encountered during flight testing concerned the landing gear. Landing gear retraction was felt to be slow and an effort was made to speed up the retraction sequence. The FF8's landing gear retraction sequence was unique - the port gerten retarget first, followed by the standard gear.

Roy Grumman's original time had specified 160 gallans of fuel; however, the Navy wanted additional range/automated the space under the cockpit floor was used to install a larger fuel tank. Production F8F and a self-sealing fuel cell of 183 gallans installed in place of the 160 gallon tank of the prototypes.

The second production F8F-1 (BulNo 90438 was used as a test aircraft at Bethpage during February 1945 to test various external factors. MR3-10 bomb rock was installed under the heading of the entertainment and a additional M15-10 bomb rock was installed in a streamlined pitym underneath area. The Bearden was authorized to carry the following external stores on the centerline rack: one MR-4100 gallop to tank; one MR3-150 gallop to tank; one 500 pomd bomb on one 1000 pound bomb. The understing radis could accommodate to a maximum of 100 pomd bombs on each rack. The radis were clear for MR-4100 gallop along north bass, 500 pomd bombs, 100 pomd bombs, and MR-11 (Palo Postis (with two 50 caliler guns) or Mo-13.175 in "Tiny Tim" rocks. As a result of the tests conducted with BulNo 90438, it was recommended that all external stores mounted under the wings be symmetrical.

Beginning the fourth production F8F-1 (BulNo 90440), two MR-9 Rocket Launchers were installed under each swing, outboard of the sing nylon. These launchers could carry such a rockates, jinch AR rockates (jinch watersh mounted on 3 inch rocket motors) or 5 inch HVAR rockets.

The real test of a carrier-based aircraft's "getting one and off the boat," and on 17 February 1945 the Bearden's first shipboard operations took place around USS CHARGE (CVE-30), CAPT (then LCDR) Robert M. Elder flew the Bearden's first Carrier Suitability Trials.

_According to Log Book entries, my first Bearden fight was in K78F-1 BuNo 90460 or Maini Field, Philadelphia on 10 December 1944. This initiated the accelerated Carter Suitability Trials of the Bearden. The pressure got that fighter deployed in combat was really high, and on 17 February 1945 was the ignore with F8F-1 BuNo 90486 for the initial carrier carrier configuration the Bearden. The carrier Suitability Trials were allowed to download the USACHRERE in Cuepage. By the weather was absolutely awful, intermittent wos, short and a building of ice on the wings. Not very representative conditions, but with the reserve power in that arcal it was somewhat incidental. I completed 13 arrested landing successfully._The FSF-1 passed its Carrier Suitability Trials with flying colors, exhibiting good landing, takeoff and deck handling characteristics, and was cleared for operations from all classes of U.S. Navy carriers, including small escort carriers (CVEs).

Navy Technical Order No. 50-545 of May 1945 delayed few restrictions on the operation of the Beareat. The only maneuvers prohibited were prolonged and invested spins. All control forces were relatively light and finely balanced over a wide range of speeds and full abrupt and steady rolls could be made up to 375 knots (430 mph). The maximum permissible speeds for reiterating and extending the landing gear was 175 knots (20 mph) and 220 knots was specified as the maximum speed for lowering the flag. Because the Beareat accelerated so rapidly, pilots had to be especially alert on takeoff, since the maximum landing gear retraction speed could be exceeded quickly.

The pilots Manual emphasized caution at the top end of the Beareat's airspeed envelope. It was high-performance aircraft, such as the Beareat, that the phenomenon of compressibility was first encountered. In a high speed dye, the first warning of compressibility effects can then fit down of Buffing. While the Beareat's airframe was strong enough to withstand considerable buffering, if speed was not reduced immediately the airplane would begin to oscillate and start to back-water. This was final warning and it power was not reduced and the five recovery flags (small speed brakes fitted just behind the wheel with yet) extended, the aircraft would move over into a flow which there was no recovery.

To aid the pilot in surviving a crash, the cockpit was modified with the addition of a rollover group mounted just behind the pilot's armored seat back. This group kept the pilot from being crushed if the aircraft flipped over on is back. German produced a modification kit to enable Navy maintenance personnel to retrofit earlier FSFs with the rollover group.

The last ten production FSF-1s (BuNo 90480 to 90499) were ferried to NAS North Island and NAS Santa Rosa, California, in order to bring VF-18 and VF-19 up to full aircraft complement and expedite their training. The Navy anxious to get their new fighter into combat.

from the fleet. VF-882 at NAS Oltune, Kansas, was equipped with FSF-1s from 1947 to 1951. After they were replaced with FSF-2Panthers, these same Bearcats were transferred to the French _Armee de l'Afte_ for use in Indochina during 1951. Bearcats lasted in other Reserve squadrons until 1953, when they were all withdrawn from active service.

Without exception, Bearcats pilots were quick to prasise the performance of the FSF. Captain Gorch E. Firebagh, Skipper of VF-5A during 1946 and 1947, had this to say about the Bearcat.

_I think it is the finest aircraft ever flow. The airplane would do everything Grammar_

_will it would. I had our a dozen engine polts will be taken at 00 hours total and we made it four minute on which to enable - a tesmitional to the handling qualities of the FSF-1._

Commander Howard S. Packard, who flew F4-4's Middesta at the Battle of Midway and later Bearcats with VF-9A, logging 540 hours and 75 arrested landings on three carriers in FSF-1s, recall what was like to try the Bearcat. He certainly had a basis for comparison. In his twenty years as a Navy pilot, Howard had flow twelve different fighter aircraft, from F4B-4b plumps to F-86 Sathers (as an exchange pilot with the US Air Force)._

_I was a great pleasure to fly and leaves a fond memory as few other aircraft have. I was was gram for aerobatics. The two most important statistics which determine a fighter aterribards performance or rarely spent - writes and power loadings. For the Bearcat they were impressive at 83.4 pounds/power._

LCDR Arnold M. Granat, who flew FSF-1s with VF-3 had these comments on the Bearcats performance:

_The Bearcat was a very responsive aircraft and carrier approaches required delicate control movements to prevent over controlling. A wave-only required a gentle application of power. "Punic" fondic could result to require roll. Acceleration was a celebrated feature and the record from a standing start to 10,000 feet stood for many years, even after the jets come on the scene. Gainway was were large. Initializing maps from 25,000 feet required indicies use of power and many a Bearcat pilot came close to hosting Teagor to the sonic record._

## F8e-1b

At the 1944 Joint Fighter Conference, the F8F-1 Bearact had been flown in mock combat against such formidable competitors as the Republic P-47D and P-47M, North American P-51D and Vought F4U-4. The pilots attending the conference (six Army, five Navy and twelve contract test jobs) were all enthusiastic about the Bearcats performed and overwhelmingly voted it best in the best-all around fighter below 2500,000 feet. Their most frequent criticism concerned the inadequate firepower of the four -50 caliber Browning machine guns and the small cockpit.

During 1946, the Navy recognized that the Bearcats's firepower was inadequate. When initially designed, it had been left that the four 50 caliber machine guns were stillient to deal with the lightly more and constructed Japanese aircraft. With the war over, however, it was now felt that the Bearcats's firepower needed to be increased, so the Navy ordered two F8F-1s to be modified with the installation of four rapid fire M32MM cannions replacing the four 50 caliber machine guns. Grumon redesigned the wing structure to accommodate two M3 cannions and 410 rounds of ammunition in each wing, with the ammunition components being part of the wing structure. In order to accommodate the ammunition feed drums, it was necessary to do two readtorg shaped bulges on the gun access doors. These bulges and the protruding canon barbers were to become the primary identification features of the common armed Bearcat, which was given the designation F8F-1.0, other than the cannon armament, the F8F-1B was externally identical to the earlier F8F-1.

CAPT Gordon Firebaugh, who conducted weapons tests with the F8F-1B, firing over 10,000 rounds without a stoppage, found the F8F-1B to be:

_A steady, from plan plan plan. However, a stoppage by one cannot could cause a skid -- nothing disturbing but if you were firing at an airborne target, it might cause a mis._

The 200MM M3 cannon was 78 inches long, weighed 112 pounds (vs. 64 pounds for the 50 caliber machine guns), had a maleyclicity of 2,850-2,950 feet per second, a range of 5,500 yards and rate of fire of 500 to 800 rounds per minute. The cannon fired a high explosive projectile of nearly ten inch in diameter, weighing 0.290 pound, while the armor piercing projectile weighed 0.39 pound.

From March of 1946 until January of 1948, Grumon built a total of 224 F8F-1Bs, Every fourth Bearcat produced after March of 1946 was an F8F-1B and its production overlapped that of the next variant, the F8F-2.

F8f-2

By 1947, the engine which the Navy had originally wanted for the Bearcat, the 2.250 hp Praft & Whitney R-2800-300W, finally became available in quantity. Grammar retained on production F8f-1 and one F8f-2.hh, which were used to build two XFF-2 prototypes- The main difference between the F8f-1 and XFF-2-2 being the installation of the R-2800-300 engine (which was the same size and dimensions as the 2-4W engine). A unique feature of the R-2800-300 engine was the Automatic Engine Control (ABC) which connected the mitotic and variable speed supercharge in one control.

Because of the increased torque of the more powerful engine, it was necessary to increase the height of the vertical tail by twelve inches. The National Advisory Committee on Aeronautics (NACA) had recommended a sixteen inch increase: however, about an increase would have provided a complete redesign of the vertical tail. The tail tail-co-figuration became the principal identification feature of the F8f-2, although the aircraft also featured a revised engine cowling, four MXs common and a reinforced canopy with an additional frame installed near the rear of the canopy.

CAPT Bob Elder compared the performance of the F8f-1 and F8f-2 and stated that,

_If few look the F8f-1 and F8f-2 models of the beloved Bavarca and only with that the (left) lead then in the Navy fighter inventory in WW 1.7 Lendl volume-what minor degradation is the F8f-2 performance, due mostly to some weight increases and an equal margin of improvement over the F8f-1 in lateral/directional control and general flying qualities._

Another unlikely source, COL George I. Ruddell, USAF, Ret. (then a MAJ) commented on the F8f-2. COL Ruddell served as an exchange pilot with VF-7 during 1948.

**This F8f-1 (Blufo 95049) was one of two retained by Grumman to serve as prototypes for the XFF-2s. The Pratt & Whitney R-2800-30W engine has been installed, but the fin and rudder have not been modified at this time, 18 September 1947. (Grumman)**

_Although I was already in Honne, flying as a member of the only, jet group in the Air Force, I start couldn't resist such an opportunity. Nine of us were not to Pravonst to Pravonst to start the exchange program. We evaluated to the F8f-2 in August, What a wonderful airplane I lived it._

In September of 1948, only two years after adopting a new squadron designation system, a completely different system was introduced. The 1948 system died the squadron number to the Carrier Air Group (CVG) to which the squadron was attached. Air Group Seven s two fighter quadrants were designated VF-17 and VF-2, while CVG-19s were designated for VF-19 and VF-20.

The Marine Corps received at Bee Boards, mostly F8f-2s. The Beatcs were used to equip advanced transients at three Marine Corps's Aguiations (MCAS) Quantic, Virginia, Cherry Point, North Carolina, and ET Doro, California.

Grumman delivered the first production F8f-2 in October of 1947 and production ended on 31 May 1949 with a total of 287 F8f-2s being manufactured. Barcatec equipped squamous growth, the feedback mechanism (B48 when twenty-four saudrons were equipped with F

Sevently Beraots were produced by Grunman for the photo-reconnaissance role under the designation F8f-2p. These aircraft differed from the F8f-2 in having camera doors installed on each side of the faselage to the rear of the wing trailing edge for the mounting of oblique cameras and another camera port on the tuselage centerline for a vertical camera. Internal hours were provided for three F8-170-F8-1 aerial cameras for vertical and oblique photographs. To save weight, only one M3 camera was installed in each wing, with the onboard cannon and its annmunition being detected, which saved a total of nearly 500 pounds. Besides the camera doors, the F8f-2p featured all 61dEditor pairings mounted in front of the camera port to keep oil and dirt off of the camera lens.

Captain Gordon Firebaugh consulted his log book to confirm flying a F8f-2p (Buso 121585) and:

_Iditor face cut shows and three arnsted landing before and after exposing the film in high-speed mans. This Baract flow just like all of them -- light on the controls. TOPS_

During January of 1949, two VC (Composite) squadrons were commissioned with the primary mission of carrier based photo reconnaissance. VC-61 was assigned to the Pacific feret, while VC-62 was the Atlantic Feret squadron. Photo detachments flying F8f-2p's were deployed on various carriers and the Beraots's only involvement of the Korean War is believed to have in the photographic reconnaissance role.

LT Ferrari Firebaugh was a C5-62 pilot with USEL TEPS photo-detantment during 1952. He recall that fighter pilots would frequently recognize the large PL tail on his Heast (Photo Hanat, Photo Ghantic Televent) and signal into close formation, slightly behind and below his Bearact. They would hand signal, "take my picture" and Frank always obliged, giving them the "high" sign" when he had shaped their pictures. They would then bank away. He does not know if they ever received their prints.

The F8f-2p's were the fastest of the Bearcast series and the last F8f-2p is to be tethered from fleet squadrons, with the late being transfered to the Reserve during late 1952.

Offhe 1263 Bearasts produced by Grunman, from the K7E-T. of 1944 the F8f-2p of 1949, all were delivered to the U.S. Navy in one standard giant-scheme: overall Gliosy Sea Blue with White Star and Bar national insignains in four positions and all service markings in White. The propellers were Black with fourinch Orange Yellow tips.

## The Blue ANGELS

The U.S. Navy Flight Demonstration Squadron, known world wide as the Blue Angels, was conceived during early 1946 (but a few months after the end of the Second World War) at the Advanced Training Unit (ATU), Naval Air Station Jacksonville, Florida. The ATU formed a team of veteran WW II combat pilots to demonstrate precision formation flying for a series of air shows scheduled for the Southeastern United States during the Summer of 1946, LCDR Roy "Butch" Voris, Chief Flight Instructor at the ATU, was in charge of the operation.

Four of the FGF-5 Hellcats assigned to the ATU were selected and repainted by the team members and volunteers. Originally the aircraft were painted a Blue door which was somewhat different Blue GrasS Sea Blue, but darker than the current Blue Angels Blue. The non-standard markings, U.S. NavyY in large block letters on the fuselage and wings, were carried in a metallic Gold paint.

The Blue Angels performed the first public show at Jacksonville's Craig Municipal Airport on I.5 June 1946. The show was a well received by the public that the team was made a full-time Navy activity. In the weeks that followed, the team performed at air shows at Corpus Christi, Texas; Des Moines, Iowa; Penascola, Florida; and Omaha, Nebraska. From Omaha the team fleve to Bethbage, Long Island, New York for about the Grumman plant. Waiting for the fathenberg were five brand per WF-1 Beards. The Grumman plant shop had painted the FSF-1s in what has become known as Blue Angels Blue, with Gold letters in the US. NavyY in block letters on the fuselage sides and the under surfaces of the wing. Something later "Blue Angels" was painted in Gold script on the coupling. With few modifications, this paint scheme has remained as the team's forward for very few years.

The team hour their FSF-1s back to NAS Jacksonville and began working with their new mounts, flying a number of training and familiarization flights. Within a month, they fleve their first public show with the Research at Denver, Colorado. The Beerat was the team mouth through the remainder of the 1946 season in order of all of the 1948 and 1948 show seasons. LCDR Bob Grace replaced Butch Voris as team leader and under his leadership the four plane diamond formation and many of the team's present day maneuvers are developed using the Beards.

During 1949, under LCDR R. E. "Dusty" Rhodes, the Blue Angels began to transition into the Grumman FGF-2 Panther. Until mid-1949, the team fleve the FSF-1s in their books, while working with the Panthers during the week. The last seven flown with the Beard was in August of 1949 at Madison, Wisconsin; however, the overall Yellow FSF-1, known as "Beteel Bomb," continued as the team's solo aircraft even after the team began doing shows with the Panther.

The same degree of discipline, teamwork and professionals exhibited by Blue Angels pilots is also reflected in performance of the elite maintenance crew, known as the "Throops," assigned to the team. For more than forty years, the "Throops" have achieved a highly enable maintenance record. The Blue Angels have never had to cancel a flight demonstration because of a maintenance problem.

Today are many formation teams, but with the "Blues" that developed, refined and predicted the art of precision formation aerobatics, long before any of their counterparts even existed. For example, the team predates the USAF "Thunderbirds" team by some seven years.

For the 1946 season, the Blue Axopels polished the aluminum leading edges of the wings and tail surfaces and applied the Blue Axopels team to the cowing in Gold script, which would become a standard marking on future team aircraft. (Jim Sullivan)

## 60 Outheast Asia

The Bearcast was to finally use combat in Southeast Asia, but not with the service for which it was intended and not in the role for which it was designed. Instead, it was used in the ground support to rely the French _Armee de l'Air_, which utilized its power, maneuverability and short tasked capabilities to fit both, rockels and napamin from short, forward area airsting -- the very top of attack mission which the U.S. Navy decided was unsuitable for the Bearcat during the Korean War.

### Armee de l'Air

By 1951, the French had become involved in heavy fighting against the insurgents of the Communist Viet Minh in Indochina (later Vietnam). During this same time period, its were replacing the Berenat in U.S. Navy carrier based squadoms, and to assist the French, the United States, through the Mutual Defense Assistance Program, agreed to supply surplus FSF-1s and FSF-1Bs to the _Armee de l'Air_ for service in Indochina.

Prior to delivery to the French, the FSFs were overchnulated and the fuel system was modified to meet French standards. Shortly after delivery the French further modified the aircraft with SCR-300 radios to improve air-to-ground communications. With these modifications, the aircraft were re-designated as FSF-1Ds. Another French modification was the addition of a locally manufactured camera pod, (made from a drop tank) which was carried on the centerline station of the Bearcast assigned to _Escientific de Reconnaissance Outre-Mot 800_ and _Escarille de Reconnaissance Photographique 72-9_, both based at Bae Mai airfield.

Initially, the French pilots suffered a number of problems during transition training. The pilots had been flying nose gear equipped Bell P-63 Kingobras and often made their landing approach in a tail high altitude. Since the Bearcast was a tail wheel aircraft with a large diameter propeller, this type of approach led to a number of FSFs being severely damaged in the resulting crash landing. Once the transition problems were overcome, the French pilots soon learned to make the most of the FSFs short takeoff capability and high performance. Both these characteristics were highly regarded by the French, who were flying missions from small forward airsting.

## Civil Bearcats

Ironically, it was as an air show aircraft and air tracer that the Barcat achieved its greatest flame and popularity in the United States, first with the Navy Blue Angels demonstration team, and later as a civil aircraft on the airshow circuit.

During 1974 Grumman, with Navy approval, built one special civilian Bearcat (Grumman designation G-SSA) for MAI All Williams and the Gulf Oil Corporation. Named "Guilhaw 4," the civil Bearcat made its first flight June of 1947 and was a top attraction at air shows throughout the United States. All military systems, storm plate, running off hold sensation, radio systems and the inability were collected for the G-SSA. With these systems eliminated, Guilhaw 4ipped the scales at almost 3,000 pounds less than a standard military FSF-1 and A Williams stated that it would be 500 mph at 19,000 feet. Grumman delivered the aircraft in Zinc Chrome trimer and a private firm applied the aircraft's distinctive Orange, White and Black paint scheme. Gulfhaw's career was not wait at its coworkers to an landing accident when the leading gear was extended but did not lock. On touchdown, the gear folded and the aircraft settled onto the drop tank which burst into flames. The Bearcat was destroyed in the resulting fire; however, AI Williams escaped unharmed.

During 195,the Wast Ask Administnation advertised for bids on thirty-two Bearcat held at the Navy storage facility at Lithchild Park, AZ. The Confederate Air Force purchased two, each with less than 250 hours on the engines, by submitting a bid of S800 apiece. Scrab declares were bidding about $750. For the bargain price of S800, the Confederate Air Force was able to rescue two classic warridships from becoming pots and pans.

Foremost among the civilian Bearcat operators was the late Bill Fornoll. Bill was a Second World War Natural Auditor who had from FSFs in the Navy and he dedicated himself to demonstrating the Bearcat to the world. He drew his FSF-2 every airshow gone house he could find, for nothing more than expenses. His routine of soft (less than 200 feet) backoffs, vertical climbs and spectacular maneuvers filled thousands at air shows all across the United States. Later, he purchased another FSF-2 and brought his son, "Corky," into the routine. The twin Bearcats were finished in a striking Bronze/Gold and Brown paint scheme when he sailed with many coast of vars. This highly visible fishished with the two FSFs to be seen from great distances. Bill died in the crash of his Bearcat at Quesot Point, Rhode Island, during 1971.

During the early 1960s another group of Bearcats were offered for public sale. These were FSF-2s and most of the Bearcats flying today are from this group. Unlimited air reading had been revived at Reno, Nevada, during 1964 and Mira Slovak Hewan FSF-2 to victory in the first Unlimited Air Race. For the next several years Bearcats dominated the Unlimited category. Lockheed test pilot, Daryl Greenauer, won the Unlimited races from 1965 through 1971, Fitting his Bearcat after his 1971 win and donating it to the National Air and Space Museum. The FSF-2 that carried by its first victory in the 1965 unlimited division of the National Air Race was in nearly stock configuration. He covered the ten 19, 8, 9 in culture course at an average speed of 57 mph and had a four mile edge over his nearest/Carlock Lyford, who was flying a P-51 Mustang. "I never had it wide open." Daryl later said.

In 1939 Fritz Wendel, a German test pilot, had established a new world speed record for propeller-driven aircraft by flying an experimental Messershint Me-2001 over a three kilometer (1.8 mile) course at a speed of 469.2 mph. Amazingly, for over thirty years no one was able to officially beat Wendel's record. Several attempts had been made after the Second World War, but each had been unsuccessful.

On 16 August 1969, Daryl Greenamyer, flying his FSF-2 Bearcat Conquest I (BuNo 121646), brought the World Land Plane Speed Record back to the United States. Over a 1.8 mile closed course at Andrews Air Force Base, he established a new record of 483.041 mph. The record, certified by the Federation Aeronautique International, easily broke Wendel's record. With the help of Grumman vice president C. H. "Corky" Meyer, Daryl Wind" company was fitted replacing the large bubble canopy, a tail oneglia was added to improve the aircraft's overall streamlining, a paddle pladed propeller (borrowed from an A-1E35 marker) helped about all the power from the engine, and a propeller spinner from a P-51H was installed. The wings were clipped at the original safety untight locations and were neatly capped with "Horne" speed tips. Finally, the landing flaps were rendered inoperative, sea and faired over. The engine used in the speed dash was a standard Pratt & Whitney R-2800 -- although a nearly new one. In a letter thanking Corky Meyer for his assistance and support, Daryl wrote:

_Tsemed doctor not guide for the FSF in your letter which is certainly shared by the and my crow... We'd not go sent nothing about the autare appearance of it, but since the performance figures are our outlook sounds to mention it. "The record load for some filteron years until broken so 30. July 1983, a highly modified P-51 Masaging known as the RB-51 Rad Baron Mustang which at a record of 499 mph."_

The Reno National Championship Air Race Race has been the longest running air areaing event history. Closlowed Gary with Bearcat was at Reno 8.1yle Shelton, with four vitories in 1973, 1975, 1988 and 1989. Lyle, in his FSF-2 "Rare Bear," won the 1989 Reno race at an average speed of 450,910 mph. In 1988, the Bearcat is a new Reno qualifying record of 474.622 mph, closely followed by another Bearcat, Don Whittagon's FSF-2, "Precious Bear," which qualified at 454.837 mph.

The fact that Rare Bear won Reno in 1988 and 1989 is not surprising, since Rare Bear was used on 21 August 1989 to establish a new land plane speed record for propeller driven aircraft of 582.32 mph capturing the record from the Red Baron RB-51 Musating by over twenty-nine mph. Rare Bear also holds the time to climb record for propeller aircraft, 3,000 meters (9,842 feet) in 91.9 seconds.

MJAI Williams and his highly colorful civil Bearcat named Gulfhawk 4. MJAJ Williams stated that Gulfhawk 4 could do 500 mph at 19,000 feet and climb to 10,000 feet in 98 seconds. (Grumman)Many of the few remaining airworthy Barecats have been lost over the years in the racing circuit. Some raced without modifications, some with various modifications; however, all were competing against Mustuas, Corscats and Sea Furies which were extensively modified with clipped wings, higher engines, etc. The Barecat remains one of the all-time favorites in unlimited racing -- and the most successful.
