(Via Shores) (Alove) The 'Z' prefix serial range was a large one, covering both Mk is and Mk Its. This Hurricane Mk, believed to be 2422, was on the strength of two 335 Squadron at Aqr during 1941, which was then undergoing training. This squadron was the first of two formed in the Middle East with Greek personnel. (Via Shores)(Above) This Hurricane Mk (1/7400) was used in forced fighter experiments during 1941. Although part of a flaffix can be seen on the right, all flight trials from Staverton used twelfixing to provide figures for the defense of Mk (1,1664) modified by F Hills a Son before the scheme was abandoned.

## MKIA SRS 2

**Key early in the war there was found to be an almost adequate need for increasing the range of the Hurricane. Fortunately further had already been conducting studies toward providing the Hurricane with under-wing auxiliary fast fans. The installation of attachment points and full laws was shown by the highest priority, with the first installation position angle of a Hurricane 1-80deg, which were the first installation of May 104. Initial installations were to look at 40 from initial position best tests, which were later later at the unwindwinded control maneuvers, and were then run made elsemosse. When the Hurricane is Less 2, we were introduced carried under aircraft aircraft conditions for carrying either auxiliary fast leaks or bombs. A degree of heading strengthen was necessary for the MKIA to withstand higher wind loadings. The majority of these aircraft returned the eight gain wing.**

HURRICANE MK IIE

The first production Hurricane filled with Universal wings capable of accommodating the full range of external weapons and fuel tanks was designated the Hurricane McK IIE. Because of its close support values the front languages was provided with additional armor protection. The RM4E prototype PK2139 was first now 23 March 1943 powered by a Million 27, driving a HotOK I8.5/11 free phased propeller. Production aircraft were powered by the Merlin 362 and began rolling out in April 1943. With the increase capacity of the Merlin 32 was decided to be further within with some consideration, and after 270 Mx Hiles had been built at dispersion was changed to Hurricane MK. IV.

## 5.2 Hurricane MK IIE

To provide place reconnaissance a number of MIs, and MK is brought up to RM4 standards with Merlin XO wires, we were equipped with cameras, MIs, MIs, and MIs 1C windows were usually retained but the warrant was removed in order to initiate that business Re-propro-MR4. Intrances were allocated for useful numbers. There wattens were provided. In fact, the commissionance, and photographic-reconnaissance. The technical-reconnaissance Hurricane was required with no workings 27-4 cameras with rich lines mounted in the rearuelueling. The _Fighte-reconnaissance_ was used to avoid exposureed at a fixed frequency 2.4 cm and the camera mounted in the afternoon wing. The photographic-reconnaissance variant was equipped with a 27-4 cm camera (three cameras with 4 inch lines mounted in the rear of the Hassele, and usually operated at those 30,000 feet. The Far East Lesser would runtimes of PhIrances with two or three cameras installed. Originally modified by 18.20 \(\mu\)m in the desert, they formed the nucleus at the 55.5 \(\mu\)m (after reprinted by 30.8 \(\mu\)m) and Rangan (Burna 19.24, Although the total number of photographic coordinates fluctuates with many, they did not allow us to measure proper or more significant aircraft were lacking. The PRU futmer's main drawbacks was used to range of the Suffre and other users were madeable in this respect and the Hurricane was gradually replaced as more suitable aircraft became available. Other Intrances undertook a dual fighter/reconnaissance code, often with reduced armor.

## 6.3 Hurricane MK IV

There was no Hurricane MK. all though this designation was originally reserved for aircraft powered by American built Packard Metin engines.

In 1943 the Hurricane MK IV, the last ramp production model, appeared. Externarily identical to the earlier MK IIE was the first example (2040G). Refer with a HotOK Ibar-based propeller powered by the Merlin 32.9GHz. Production MK was retained the three-studied microseconds for either the 1,624 to be 24.26 or 27.9 times-total topological versions of the Merlin XO engine. Deposited ge (Above) It was not unusual for MK No to carry a drop tank under one wing and rockets under the other wing. This machine head is a strong green dwarf inspiral under the exhaust states on the port side and was on strength with No 6 Squadron in the Balkans, probably at Prices during the spring of 1946. (Shores)

## HURRICANE MK XII

By the time war broke out, the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF) had ninetet Hurricane MK is on strength, these having been the subject of an order for twenty-based before hostilling commenced. After negotiation is a further half a 13-1648 was sent by Hearsker Aircraft to Canadian Car & Foundry (CCAF) group with competing plans on microfilm for production of Hurricane MK is powered by British Math in engines shiped from England to Canada.

Since the Hurricane MK uses timely continue development, Hearsker requested that an adequate ion in Mark Numbers be left to allow for their British designations, and consequently Cocker produced Hurricane logging with the Mark X designation. Canadian production went so well that the RT Canadian produced Hurricane MK is well delivered over a year after the pattern aircraft was shiped. After 1664 heafin required Hurricane was produced, producing was switched to the MK. The designator used to identify Hurricane sources powered by the American manufactured Packard Martin 28 powerlaw. At 434 Hurricane MK is view built to British contract, with twenty-five being taken over by the RCAF, and given Canadian series. At 24 event were produced with plain gun amma, then, although in mountain cases this was changed to twelve meaning guns for our camma to transparent to other heaters or to the Russians. One MK, X RCAF -1362 (A310) was experimentally fitted with a fixed soil landing gear incorporating hydraulic timing.

## HURRICANE MK XI

Essentially similar to the Mr X, the Hurricane MK designation was applied to aircraft fitted with CRAF equipment built in a batch of fifty that were mixed in with McK in OK contracts. A further sub-variant, the Hurricane MK is believed to have referred to installation of the Packard-Merlin 29 engine with a different peer reduction ratio.

## HURRICANE MK XI

Initially distributed the Hurricane MK in [Can], the 474 Hurricane MKis produced were powered by Packard Martin 29 engines. Setting entirely with Canadian buffer units, they carried semi-time REAC 5376-5778, and equipped to believe signatures in Canada. They were used in both fighter and any operation codes, primarily to maintain Canada security in the event of a different enemy attack on her shipping, Hurricane MKis along with other aircraft few continuous offshore amots, on which for German-U-books, for no contact was recorded.

A Hurricane MK(RCAF) began was the second Hurricane being be converted to take a validation gear and was tested at Rockvilleville entry in 1943. Even though a speed verification is 300 mph new second, the best given workload adequately but no operational faults were made. In particular MrX,01 in common with the majority of Hurricanes flow by the RCAF in Canada, did not have a sprimer over the airscrew hub.

Including the Sea Hurricane XII, Canadian Car and Foundry built 1451 Hurricanes, with producing monitoring during the summer of 1943. CXAF distributed under 1.206 Hurricane wings and 1.166 edge logs under one of the most successful early programs for the Canadian aviation industry.
