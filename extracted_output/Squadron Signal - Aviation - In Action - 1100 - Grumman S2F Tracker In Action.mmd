## Chapter 5 Appendix

## Introduction

The Second World War had demonstrated the tremendous destructive power of unrestricted submarine warfare and the need for specialized aircraft to combat this threat to the safe movement of men and supplies to the war fronts. The US. Navy successfully fought the U-Rour and emerged from World War II with the most powerful NAI Arrow in the world. During the late 1994 and early 1995, US. Naval storage on Anti-Submarine Waraker (ASW) entered around the Hunter-Killer aircraft concept. Atting as a team, the Hunter would not locate the target the killer aircraft would destroy it. The first aircraft types used for this mission were the IBM-SW (Hunter) and Tap-IS (Killer); both of which were derived from the Grunham Aerwert together bomber.

During the 1995s, the Aerwer ASW team was replaced by the Grunham-built AF Guardian the largest, single engine aircraft to serve in the US. Navy. The Guardian was also used in the Hunter-Killer concept/ing two variants, the AF-ZW (Hunter) and Ar-Z-IS (Killer). Both the Aerwer and Guardian required to be aircraft acting as a team, which could have led to a problem of either aircraft developed mechanical problems. If that occurred, the mission could not be from. In addition, both were single engine aircraft and the Navy wanted the reliability and safety that a train engined aircraft would provide. With the solution to those two problems in mind, Grunham began work on a new ASW aircraft with two engines and with sufficient internal space for both sensors and armement in a single afirmance.

The new ASW aircraft was first conceived during 1994's and the Grunham model G-89.

Grumman submitted the design proposal to the US. Navy during early 1995. In major advantage to the ASW mission was in combining both the Hunter and Killer roles into one aircraft, the G-89, which could handle both the detection and attack roles. The Navy ASW mission description consisted of, detecting, tracking and destroying enemy sub-arrays; providing all-user and anti-submarine protection for comy and Naval Task Force; providing ASW barrier patrols for fixed geographical areas; locating energy surface targets, conducting air reconnaissance operations; and, if needed, obtaining photographic records of all attacks and their results. The G-89 was the first ASW platform to combine all of these functions within a single afirmance.

In June 1990, the US. Navy gave Grunham the go-ahead to produce two prototypes of the G-89 under the designation XSPEC-1 (Bus.12937 and 129183). The first prototype emerged as a twin engined, high time monophine with vircelable landing gear and single wheel taller humidest. The aircraft featured a retracticable bellow-mounted and a tail mounted retracable Magnetic Anomaly Detection (MAD) boom. The XSPEC-1 prototype carried over four, pilot-to-end two ASW systems operators. Provisions were made to carry two anti-submarine protodes in the fuselage weapons and three stations were provided under each nine for rockers or other quadana. The aircraft was configured with catapolar gear and an arresting hook to enable it to operate from carrier deck.

Powered by a pair of 1500 W bright Bright R-1820 cyclone engines driving square tipped, three blade Hanning Standard Proplets; the first X2821 - prototype (BuNo 129137) fire on December 1992. During February of 1995, the prototype began its initial flight, evaluations at the Naval Air Test Center (NATC) Paturesent River, Maryland. By October 1995, the second X822-1 (BuNo 129138) joined the testing and this aircraft was used to conduct carrier suitability trials at Paturesent (Pax) River. The favorable results of the **Test X322-1 (BuNo 129137) carries a test instrumentation probe on the starboard with a **test** bed of the **5**, **5**, and **6**,these trials and the tests at Pav River convinced the Navy to place an initial order for fifteen aircraft (Busos 12913-12(S15)) under the designation S2F-1.

Former Navy pilot Bob Kowalski, whose military flying career included both the Grammma-built iAF Guardian and the S2F-1/S2F-2, compared the qualities of the two different aircraft:

_In October of 1984, when PS-30 quantisation from the Grammma-AF Guardian to the S2F, the change was not looked forward to by many pilots-- we preferred the "perumbrose" sequences of the \(x\) to the compared clones of the Packov's non-exotic KPIng the S2F required a recent of the hand rules. When flying the Guardian, the left hand would be on the frontier and the right hand of the projectile. The Packov required the left hand on the protocol space the right hand on the theoretical worldsheet the right hand on the theoretical worldsheet the redward the the overhead band. The benefits of the Tucker appear when the pilot stopped in and started the engines-- the usually opened forward visibility was most visible. Some also was then too._

_also was much too._

## S2F-1 (S-2A)

Little change occurred between the prototype XS2F-1s and the production S2F-1: Production S2F-2s featured an aprated 1.525 B Wright-1.820-82 engine in place of the 5010 B R-2508 used on the prototype. When Grunnian first five the production S2F-1 on 7 July 19 S3 (BuNo 129139), the aircraft had not received its official name. For a brief time just after its introduction, the name Sentinel was used. However, this did not last long since the same was already it used us the Fusion 1.5- The Navy finally officially named the S2F-1 the Tracker, although, modified the airches had adopted the name SCOF (TS-WFC). Both have several thought the Tracker's twenty-three year operational care. Later in 1992, when the Navy Department issued a sweeping redesignator of most of its aircraft, the S2F-1 was designated the 5-2A.

Grimman, working closely with U.S. Navy requirements, installed the most modern AsV detection equipment available to hunt creep subshariness. With this sensor suite, the Tracker was capable of detecting, identifying and tracking subshariness in all kinds of weather. With its internal arrangement, the Tracker could also attain several destroy the target, with the service introduction of the Tracker, the days of the two-aircraft Hutter-Killer concept were not.

With a full full lead of 520 gallos of aviation gas, the S2F-1 had a combat range of 841 nautical hand and a flight endurance of just over six hours. Cwing speed of the Tracker was 130 hours (150 mph) with a top speed of 230 hours (265 mph). This performance was ideal for the length sensor missions and barrier pitch speeds of a fleet saw aircraft.

For hunting submariness, the Tracker was equipped with a belly-mounted random containing an ANV/S 38 search radar. The radome was aerodynamically coloured in the repeated position, fitting roughly within the fuselage, came within 38 inches being completely flash with the fuselage underwater. For AWS missions, the radome was lowered 24.5 microns to fully extended position. The final mounted detectable MAI) boom could be extended into fact behind the Tracker. Installed over the cockpit nearly Tracks (up to about 132.93 hours), was a b-picar A/A/B/C detection finding antenna. This installation was registered by the ANV-A/B/C ratio mounted antenna on S2F-1. This R-1500-820 was located on the intersection plane of the impact of passive electronic emissions from submarine contacts. For identifying targets at night, early S2F-1 carried a powerful seventy million end-end-end-end-event observation installation in tap on the quadruped wing. Late Production S2F-1 is and export variants provided to our allies under the MDAP (Mutual Defense Aid Program), year equipped with a more powerful eight-type million sandpaper searchfile.

Armament for the S2F-1 was carried as unit narrowing tracks (three per time) and/or in the internal weapons by Depending on the mission, the internal bay could house a 40.444 A/B/C 3800 seconds, bombs or depth charges. The understations could carry 350 pounds on the island and outward photons and 265 pounds on the center pylos. Normal weapons carried on these pylos consisted of 5 inch HVAR rockets, bombs, MK 54 depth charges, or 275 inch rocket pods.

The Tracker's wings had a unique folding arrangement. The hinge line was angled in such a way that the quadruped wing folded slightly forward and the port wing, slightly art. This arrangement kept the lowest profile possible for folded using storage aboard carriers. For maximum inefficiency, all Tracker variants (Tradec and Tracker included) used a fixed wing slot on the undersurface of the outer wing panels just to the rear of the wing leaking edge.

Each of the two engine nacelles were designed to carry eight S3Q-2 sonobuoys and a pair of larger S3Q-1 sonobuoys (twotop tubes) in drop tubes mounted at the extreme end.

_match The S2F-1 handed well in flight and was quite an improvement over the air of Guardian._

Looking at the complete Tracker line, the S2F (S-2) served the Navy for 23 years, flew over 10,100,00 hours (about 1 billion miles), made over 744,400 carrier landing on over forty U.S. and foreign aircraft carriers and served in the armed forces of fourteen foreign countries.

## Canadian Trackers

During 1956,GetAllstand and Canada acquired oneGrumman S2F-1 Tracker for testing and evaluation. Upon selection as the Royal Canadian Navy's new ASW aircraft, deflavilland negotiated a license production agreement with Grunman and became the prime contractor for production of the S2F in Canada. Many Canadian companies shared in the manufacture of the Trackers, with sub-contractors being responsible for the wings, needless, landing gear and electronics. Final assembly was undertaken by fedal ATHAI at their plant in Downwise, Canada.

The Tracker (RCN 1501) was delivered to the Canadian Navy test and evaluation squadron, SV-104 during 1956 for a period of evaluation and trials. This aircraft was joined, during September 1957, by an S2F-1 (Buh 136519/RCN 1500) which was obtained from US. Navy stocks.

The first production CSE-1 was accepted by the Royal Canadian Navy and was assigned to V8-18 on February 1957. The squadron embarked in HMDS BONANE-10000-in Apr 2005 of 1957 to its first at deployment. In October 1957 a second squadron, VS-800, was re-equipped with the Tracker. In Canadian Navy service, the Tracker originally served the NSW stock at 194th the US. Navy, In July of 1959 VS-881 was disabled, leaving V8-800 as the sole ASW squadron, although two Utility Squadators (VV) also operated the Tracker.

Under the terms of the license agreement between Grunman and deHavillard Aircraft of Canada, a total of 90 trackers (in two variants) were produced by deflavilland. The first production variant was designated the CSE-1 and was, externally, identical to the Grunman-built S2F-1: differing mainly in the antennas carried on the aircraft. None of the Canadian-built Trackers carried the APRA-95 ECM direction finder radon above the fastestage, most having a smaller square antenna in the same location. A total of forty-Gyrc CSE-1-s were produced.

As a result of proposed improvements suggested by the Royal Canadian Navy (RCN), deflavilland produced fifty-five updated Trackers under the designation CSE-2: the improvements incorporated in the CS2F-2 were the addition of an improved MAD system, an upward radar and improvements in ASN sensors. Externally there was little difference between the two models, except in antennas.

Between 1964 and 1967, a mid-life update was performed on the Canadian Trackers. The update consisted of the installation of the ANN-601 total computer/ navigational system, APRA-500 Doppler radar and improved JULIE/JEEEL ASW sensors. After updating, the Trackers were reclassified as CSE-3.8's. It should be noted that the Canadian Trackers, despite similar designations, were not equivalent of US. Navy S2F-1, S2F-2 or S2F-3: aircraft.

During 1964, two CSE-1 Trackers were modified for the Carrier On Board Delivery (COD) role cleaning all ASW gear and installing six passenger seats, safety equipment and a fuel in the weapons busy. These aircraft were assigned to V0-32 in January of 1965 and new from HMDS BONANE/UNFUE until the ship was retired from Canadian service in December of 1969.

In February of 1966, the Royal Canadian Navy, Royal Canadian Army and Royal Canadian Air Force were united, forming the Canadian Armed Forces. The Navy now became known as the Maritime Command. At ri-service designation system was also adopted and the Trackers were redesignated as CP-1218.

In December 1973, the decision was made to delete all ASW equipment from the Trackers and utilize them in the meantime surveillance role. At this same time VS-80 was redesignated as Maritime Reconnaissance Squadron (MR) 880. During the late 1970s, the remaining Trackers in Canadian service were modified with updated search radar, navigational systems and communications equipment. More recently, the aircraft were further modified to carry photo reconnaissance pads on the wing protons. Additionally, the aircraft are now configured to carry CRV-HYAR rocket beds and all have the capability of carrying SKAD (Survival Kit Air Dropable) pods on the wing pylons for Search and Rescue work.

Recently, one Tracker has been re-engineered with twoprop engines under a program being developed by the IMP Group of Halifax, Nova Scotia (similar to the Turbo-Tracker developed by Marsh Aviation of Messa, Arizona). At this time, there are eighteen Trackers remaining in service with MR-800, V1-3 and no free systems (Nos-46 and 420). Another eleven aircraft are also available, being currently held in storage. If recently announced plans for budget reductions go through, all CAF Trackers will be retired shortly, after thirty-two years of service.

Recently, the Brazilian Navy announced that it has placed a 40 million (Canadian) dollar contract with IMP or modification of its remaining/next Trackers to the turbopop configuration for operation from the Brazilian carrier MINAS GERAIS. The re-engineering program is expected to not only improve the aircraft performance, at leaston s a problem that the Brazilian Air Force has had as 8-S plane. Currently, the S-2s can only be operated from bases where AVGA (asiation gasoline) is available, restricting its use in the marine reconnaissance sector. The first convorings are planned to be done in Canada, while others will be performed by Brazilian Air Force errors with kits supplied by IMP. The reengine program is expected to extend the service title of the Brazilian S-2s with timed test near century.

A number of other countries have also expressed interest in converting their Trackers to turbopop configurations, including South Korea and Taiwan.

S2F-2 (S-2C)

The S2F-1 suffered from one major draw-back; its weapons bay was too small to handle the bulky early model nuclear depth changes in service during the 1950s. With this in mind, Grumma recognized the S2F-2S telescope to accommodate a larger weapons bay. This redesign resulted in the S2F-2S-2C) and Grumma built sixty of this variant for the US. Navy (BuNo 1333-1333) made it still flight from 12 July 1954.

Externally the S2F-2 differed from the earlier S2F-1 in having an enlarged weapons bay fitted on the port under studies of the baseline. This resulted in a bulge to the port of side-by the S2F-2 baseline (later reduction in the size of the nuclear depth change enabled it to be carried) at all Tracker variants. The ring stations of the S2F-2 were strengthened and cleared for carrying the Aero 6.0 rocket nuclear boards.

To improve the aircraft's handling, especially at low speeds, the horizontal stabilizer was increased in span from 22 feet4 inches to 27 feet 2 inches. The S2F-2 retained the same error complement, powerplants, and internal ASW equipment as the earlier S2F-1. To test the aerodynamics in the new weapons bay, Grumma built a weapons bay may lock such confusion which was installed on S2F-1. airframe for flight tests.

The first production S2F-2S-C/B NuNo 133329 made it still flight from 12 July 1954. One month later, the US. Navy conducted its preliminary aircraft evaluation, with the trials running from 11 through 14 August 1954. The fourth production S2F-2 (BuNo 13332) joined the test program and was used for carrier suitability trials conducted at NATC Panstent River during early April of 1955. This Tracker was then embarked in USS BENNINGTON for shipboard carrier suitability demonstrations. The tests ran from 27 April10 to May 1955, after which the S2F-2 was declared acceptable for shipboard operations. The first production S2F-2 (BuNo 13331) to be destined for squadron service was delivered to the Navy on 23 November 1954.

Former Naval Aviation Boto Kobashinsky remembers the S2F-2:

_when the S2F-2 was involved. S2F-1 always incident a big suprise: Grumma._

_reversed the pick pitch mechanism so that the S2F-2 would not help-up in landing partractions at high and S2F-1. The Tracker model now briefly down. The worst of this trial quickly spread among flag pilots. As a result, the technique onboard to leave the landing gear in the down position until a safe altitude was attained._

As the S2F-2(S-2C) was replaced by new Tracker variants, a number were converted to the utility to under the designation of US-2C; Stripped of their ASW equipment, these aircraft were used primarily as target-tows.

## US-2C

Of the sixty S-2C Trackers produced by Grumman, forty-eight were eventually modified to the US-2C target-towing configuration. The US-2C had all ASW gear including the upper and lower roadness, MAB boom, and wing-mounted searchlight deleted and had a target-to-kit installed in the space formerly taken up by the heldy radome. Unlike the earlier US-2A and US-2B, the US-2C engine meclips, were not flaired over.

During 1964, the US-2C Tracker replaced the D-6D-4D (JD-1) harder as the primarystro-to-air guenary target to aircraft in the Pacific Fleet. Target towing is some-what dangerous operation and US-2C Tracker cross sometimes thought of themselves as a flying shooting gallery. The two target was some twenty-three feet long and was used with the blanketed on a long cable. The target sleeve offered the ships and aircraft of the feet practice in the task of destroying aerial targets.

In addition to the target-towing duties, the US-2C was utilized as an airborne radar target and carried out simulated intercept and match mission profiles to train ground radar and shipboard Count Information Center (CLC) personnel.

ByOctober of 1981, all US-2C aircraft had been phased out and retired from the U.S. Navy. The US-C's were the most colorfully-marked Trackers in the Navy, normally carry a ring thrill marking consisting of an Engine Gray tuselage, Yellow wing/horizontal stabilizers, a Red vertical stabilizer and Red wing bands.

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:30]

S2F-3 (S-2D) was the third and final airframe design change in the S-2 Tracker line. Grumman manufactured 100 aircraft and this variant incorporated some major structural changes. When the S2F-3 (S-2D) entered service with the U.S. Navy during October of 1960, it allowed the Navy to retire the majority of the remaining S2F-1s, with most leaving service by the end of 1961.

The S2F-3 (S-2D) incorporated the most modern adsorbents in airborne ASW electronics available, including updated IULF and IZEZEBL equipment, along with increased ramament capability. It looked and listening to renewly submarities with powerful radar and sonobos, echo ranging explosive charges and MADs. S2F-3 differed from the earlier S2F-1 and S2F-2 in a number of ways. The APA-49 ECI direction finder random over the cockpit was deleted. With the reduction in the size of ASW sensors, the ordered weapons by the S2F-3 was no longer necessary and the breakage was returned to the shape of the earlier S2F-1. The rear of each engine needle has changed. The "hawkall" flaring was deleted and the Liseux were aligned to increase the sonobu capacity from eight on the S2F-1 to sixteen on the S2F-3 (S-2D).

For a total capacity of thirty-two sonobos, the S2F-3 featured practical R18-20A and engines which required the engine air intake on the upper engine needle to be enlarged.

By a rearrangement of internal equipment, the fuselase crew compartment section was increased eighteen inches in length and 3.35 inches in width. This gave the crew additional room and allowed for an increase in internal field capacity. With the additional feet, the S2F-3/S-2D could remain in station for seven and one half hours, over an hour longer than earlier versions.

To give the Tracker increased lift to compensate for its higher gross weight, the wing was increased by three feet. The windings were also changed from the squared of tips of the earlier S2F variants to a rounded wing with distinct humid-in ECM antennas. The majoring polus were strengthened to allow for the carriage of heavier ordinance loads including ASW sensors. For auster ASW equipment operation, the S2D electrical system was changed from DC to AC power. The larger horizontal tail, first installed on the S2F-3 (S-2C), was on the S2F-3.

The first pre-production S2F-3 (bus 145731) made its first intention on 20 May 1999.

Carter trains were held aboard the LSS NTRTRIP and LSS READER's during the late Spring Summer Summer of 1960. The first delivery of a production S2F-3 to a fleet squadron was made to V5-84 R&A Norsfolk, Virginia, on 20 October 1960.

The Tracker restructuring to the carrier after a night surveillance mission with a dispersometer of the HORNET's radar screen approximately 100 miles from the ship. Although an extensive Search and Rescue effort was mounted, no trace of the S-2D or its crew was ever found.

## US-2D

A total of fifty-four SZF-3(S-2D) airframes were modified as utility/training aircraft under the designation US-2D. This version was a utility and training aircraft and flew exclusively with the US. Navy. Unlike the three earlier utility variants (US-2A, -2B, -2C, US-2D) retained the US-2D-mounted random: however, all internal ASW equipment was removed. Although the searchlight assembly was retained on the wing, its internal parts were deleted. Neither the belly radome or searchingl nuclei was started over.

## ES-2D

Seven S-2D airframes were converted to the electronics role under the designation ES-2D. These aircraft carried additional electronics equipment and most served as range-clearing aircraft for Navy missile test ranges such as Point Mugo, California. A number of ES-2D has an additional search radar razone installed on the forward underside of the fuselage. In addition to its mission of range-clearing, ES-2D also functioned in an Airborne Early Warning (AWF) having role.

The last ES-2D flight converted in March of 1986, as the last STOFOF left the Pacific Missile Range Facility and was retired from the US. Navy. The aircraft's last flight was the Davis-Monthan storage facility in Arizona.

## A US-2D (BuNo 147872)

An ES-2D (BuNo 147872) assigned to the Pacific Missile Range at Point Mugo, California, during October of 1973. The aircraft carries powerful speakers mounted on the outboard wing pitch to warn boarders of an impending missile launch, (Peter Manousi)S2F-3S (S-2E) was an improved version of the S2F-3S (S-2D) and the last production variant of the S2F to be built by Grumman. A total of 252 were manufactured, with 238 seeing service with the U.S. Navy and fourteen being exported to Australia.

The S2F-3S (S-2E) differed externally from the S2F-3S the addition of an antenna bulge under the rearstage just behind the retractable jelly redry change and the addition of a long, retractable blade antenna on the underside of the fuselage which ran parallel to the weapons by hinge lines.

The major internal change between the S-2D and S-2E was the installation of the AS-30 Automated Tactical Navigation Equipment system. This system replaced the AS-13 piloter, the navigational component and the AS-31 Julie computer. This equipment change brought the gross weight of the S-2E to 29.159 pounds, some 3.150 pounds heavier than the S2F-1. The F-1 autopilot of earlier S-2 variants was replaced by the MA-67 autopilot, which maintained both altitude and heading. Improvements in the MAD gear more than the double detection range over the full of the S2F-1 US-2A. The larger, 728 gallon, fuel capacity of the S-2F increased the aircraft endurance to eight hours. As a safety feature, the aircraft was equipped with an improved focal clump system which allowed the internal fuel to be titigtened more quickly.

The S2F-3S (S-2E) was capable of speeds in excess of 200 knots (230 mph) and could reach an altitude of 20,000 feet. The S5 million candlepower searchlight (carbon arc) would effectively illuminate a submarine snorke on mile away from an altitude of 30 feet. On patrol missions, the S-2E normally cruised at 130 knots at an altitude of 1,500 feet.

The S-2E first entered fleet service with V8-41 during 1962 and the type remained in service until the early 1970s when they were replaced by the last of the S-2 series, the S-2G.

S-2E's of V8-27 on the flight line of NAS Rota, Spain, during April of 1972, V8-27 was attached to CSVS-56 aboard the USS INTERPUB. One of the identification features of the S-2E was the second smaller by mounted redome just behind the retractable raome. (U.S. Navy via Peter Meraky Collector)

The S-2G was the final variant of the S-2 series to see service with the U.S. Navy. The S-2G was not production aircraft but rather a rebullid program involving 3-S2 air-france, moschitlit with new electronics. The first S-2G was delivered in December of 1972 and went VS-37 based at NAS North Island, California WS-37 used the S-2G during its WESTDA deployons onboard the USX KITY HAVE during 1973 and 1975.

The S-2G featured updated X-ray equipment, in the form of the AN/AQA-7 DIFAR processing equipment which more efficiently handled someously transmitted information. This equipment was the same installation which had been installed on the P-3-Oron. Extension, the S-2G different from the earlier S-2G in the installation of a three-thobe smoke marker retro-stepot mount on the standard side of the stathord engine nucleic.

The S-2G modification program was carried out by Navy personnel using kits provided by the Baltimore division of the Martin-Matricis Corp. the actual modification was handled by the Naval Air Recon Facility (NARF) at NAS Quosnet Point, Rhode Island. The S-2G was destined to serve longer than originally intended, shillet system standards transmitted to the Lockhead S-3-Wiring. The Navy wanted to have several aircraft, the S-2G Tracker, flying with operational her runs at the S-3 Wiring were being based in the ASWP code. As the number of operational 3-3-squashos increased, the S-2G were withdrawn from service and retired. In August of 1977, the last S-2G (BuNo 152374) of VS-37, was officially retired and made its final flight to the Davis-Monthan AFB storage facility.

## Turbo-Tracker

Marsh Aviation of Mesa, Arizona, developed the first turbopropor conversion of the S-2 airframe during 1986. These aircraft were intended for the time fighting role for the California Forestry Department. The Marsh conversion consisted of removal of all ASW related equipment from surplus-S-2 airframes, installation of a fire retardant that in the weapons bay, and re-engineering with 1,112 ship Garrett TP233-14 turbopropop engines driving fire blade Hartrell propellers.

With the new engines, the S-2 has a 69 mph input consisting speed with a fifty percent reduction in fuel consumption and a tiny percent reduction in takeoff and landing runs.

With the success of the Marsh conversion, other turboprop conversion programs aimed at the military market are being undertaken. During February of 1989, IPM of Canada received a contract to convert even S-2s for the Brazilian Navy with Pratt & Winburg PT6A-7 turbopropops. This contract is in addition to the work being done by IMP for the Canadian Armed Forces.

Grummas has received a $260 million contract to modify thirty-two S-3E Trackers to the S-2T Turbo Tracker configuration for supply to Taiwan under a Navy administered FMS contract. The S-2T differs from the Turbo Tracker conversions than that it uses the IS49s Garrett TP33-1SAW turboprop engine driving a low blade Rode Doppler.

Several other countries are currently considering converting their Trackers to the Turboprop configuration, with the majority of these projects at present depending on finding the necessary funding.

**This S-2T Turbo-Tracker is one of thirty-two aircraft being modified by Guraman for Taiwan under a S-1 Navy administered FMS contract. The aircraft are powered by 1,648 ship turboprop engines, have new switches and updated ASW systems. (Grumman)**

## WF-2 (E-1b)

To provide the fleet with an Airborne Early Warning (AEW) aircraft designed a detect enemy aircraft and direct fighters to intercept them, Grimmman developed the model G-117. The G-117 was basically a TF-1 airframe modified to accept an airborne radar system. The aerodynamic prototype (C-1A Bus No 13672), carrying the large target shaped antenna showing the fusage, first few \(W\) in December 1965. Itesh with this aircraft and three pre-production trials aircraft(BusNo 136597, 958 and 146303) proved the essential and the Navy ordered the aircraft into production under the designation WF-2 (E-1B) Tracer. The first production Treader made its initial flight in 28 February 1985.

The WF-2(E-1b) Tracer featured a lengensteed fusage engine eighteen inches longer than the TF-1 and a modified tail section to support the large radome. The tail section consisted of twin outer fins with a short middle fin. The middle fin served as the rear super-port for the massive AF-S2 radome, mounted on the top of the fuselage by a series of three struts. The WF-2 had many nicknames inspired by its appearance and its designation, such as the 'STOOF WITH A ROOT" and the 'WILLLE FUDD."

The overhead wing-folding arrangement of the S2F and C-1A, was replaced on the Tracer with a rearward-folding wing similar to those used on the Grunnman FdF and FdF of WW II flame, A steerable tailwheel was installed to help maneuver the Tracer on the deck, since the aircraft was somewhat headway with the wings in the folded position. As with the earlier S2F and C-1A, the WF-2 was powered by 1,525 hr Wright R-1820-82A engines.

When the WF-2(E-1B) joined the fleet during early 1961, the Tracer soon replaced the remaining BudSA-SW (A-1G) Skyadays as the standard shipboard AFW aircraft. Besides its primary AEW mission, the WF-2 was also used in the search centre via inforte. When assigned to fleet carrier, WF-2(E-1B) squadations usually deployed a four aircraft detachment.

Grumman produced a total of eight eightyeight Tracers for the U.S. Navy: These aircraft saw extensive service during the early Vietnam War: providing combat air pattoric (CAP) lightures with target vectors, and controlling Alpha Strikes over North Vietnam. With a search radius of some 250-300 miles, the L-B served as an early warning to strike aircraft of enemy MG activity. During 1904, the Tracer was joined in three sense by the Grunn-2A Hawkesey and by May of 1973, only four Tracers of RVAW-110 at NAS North Island, California remained in service. These were soon retired during mid-Summer of 1973, and were ferried to the Davis-Monthan storage facility.
