world for the first time when the y-2-pass from over the 11th Olympiad in Berlin in August while the world's first television camera recorded the event.

By November, when definitive evaluation trials were held at Trenmodue, the fit to 100 had one full title, from raw outside to obvious rewrite. With Or. Ing., Herman Winterst at the controls, the fit to 100 was put through twenty-three left hand songs, immediately followed by twenty-one consecutive right songs, then a near vertical dive from 23,000 feet. The English plot recorded the BT 109's victory when he decided to follow. This performance, plus the fact that the BT 109 was closer to build that the Heinsel desired, decided the issue. The 109 was chosen as the leftwards standard first-time figure. Just prior to the Trenmodue trials the HAT slowed oscillations increasing the longitude's armament from two to three time spans. A third 17 was mounted between the cylinder banks of the Jump engine, fring through the propeller hub. With a specialty designed cropped spiner this was accomplished on the BT 109's.

Each of the reproduction batch were assigned _rench numbers_.

## 1098-01 - 21 1090/4

### B1098-02 - 21 1090/4

By fitting for the first time in November of 1936 the three-grained BT 1090/4 was the last machine to be powered by the Junaries Jump 210A. The V4 and V6 which joined the test program in December were powered by the improved Jump 210B offering 6000 for the minutes at sea and a continuous 540B. Three coding slots of the runs replaced the single cooling intake and a production sinkers was added.

Since July 1936, civil war had been ranging in South with the Sourcing supporting the Loyalisti side and Germany supporting the Nationalcastle. By November 1936 the _Loyalisti_/_hertz_ and some 4500 volunteers of the Legon Cordier to monitor the flight. Plots of _adaptive_ 88, the fighter component of the Legon Cordier, had begun to complain that their Heinsel fit to Elight phones were contained in natural every reserved by the Russian Poliavalizer's 116's. This was viewed with such alarm in Berlin that the three arm prototypes, B1 609/3.4, V4 and V5 were crated to all of the extent of B109 for service evaluation against the Russian aircraft. After many delays and mechanical breakdowns, one of which were done for such experiments, _adaptive_ 88 was able to get enough timing time to prove the marked superiority of the 109 or anything else in the Spanish stroke. Overdent Guanther Radbach, who used it before one of the two nights-fighter pilots with even 60%, with his first triethirty in the BT 109.

We went by ship from running by Keith Griggsel as fourlets, ten or twelve higher flight times - our six US release on board our safe panel in Cerates. As soon as our arrival were not together, we ran the testing to 30 September. At the end of 1936 we got the first time 109.1 to get truly return to which tiny tiny bits the top with very ten machines. We were trying from Viton to protect the bombers, there was a test squadron of bothers (Garnbridge 88-Astro) short based only with 1.8 u was found right day and was led to protect a 68% with our three 40%. As we argued the harder law for aircraft, Asia Solplanes, climbing against the bothers. We caught them as they can, we caught them as they can, we could then then. We could then, for some and created help them. My two companions opened free to early and threat the Alaska sealed, but their other didn't seem to notice anything, the stated quiet, only that the two machine names so follows, and to try these letters 1 opened free. When I did, they parsed it a few rounds and quit - it was enough though. The Asia slowly tuned over and went down. No smoking, nothing, if I felt to about a thousand meters above the ground and then disintegrated.

After nearly three months of intermittent combat duty the prototypes were disassembled and returned to Messerschritt to continue in the development program.

## Appendix Bf 109b-2

During the summer of 1937, after less than thirty examples of the Bf were produced, it was replaced on the assembly line by the **Bf 109b-2**, the initial examples of which differed solely in having the fixed-pitch wooden propeller replaced by a variable-pitch, two-blood group. Again the first lightens to roll off the assembly line were washed to Scan, with a total of 4810 Bf-18 and Bf2 being eventually shipped to the Legon Center. The Bf 109 position had all but complete master of the air over the heart Benjamin, sweeping its enemies from the skigs, and the German propagation ministry explained with the usual exaggerated motions. History, however, would prove these associations very accurate, while the state that the lighter was in "un-judessed" use was blatantly untrue. In August 1937 only 1103, 1326 _Inchord_ to 2345 September and Bf 109 does and none of these were at all strength, it would be November before a fourth Gruppe, II/O 234, began equipping with the _first_.

In fact, as these 12 March 1938 show the basis force into Austria, the _Lufraffe_ had only 12 _249920_ and counting those in Spain of which they had converted or were converting to the Bf 109. Either equipped with or converting to the 109 were:

## Appendix Bf 109c

During early spring of 1938, the **Bf 109C**, which was intended to be the definitive Jumbo-powered production aircraft, system peaking to the **Bseries** on the production line. Prepared by a 700 m, **Bf**, injected alone 2016A, the **C** and **B**, had a rediscovered exhaust system which feature the addition of short pipes which carried the hot passes away from the cooling. The addition of total injection time between the distinct advantage over a carbon saturation system by being being due to reaction equally as well occurred, or under negative **B** forces, especially important during a dopidant. Again a centrally mounted weapon was tried without success, a 200m MW FRI carbon. As a result, an MG 17 machine gun was initiated in each new just just completed of the wheel.

With some of the first battle among to Spain to be used the Legon Condor and service test the newman, it wasampered for today 132, the first moment until to receive the **C**, series, and fully exchanged its 18-19 for the newer C-1. Neither the **Bf 109C**, which continued experimenting with the following engine-mediated MG FF common, nor the **Bf 109C** approach instead of MG FF common in wing positions, ever went into production. With the absorption of Austria in the Genetic Result out of the new, Miller turned his attention to the recovery of the Sutherland. As tension in Europe increased over the question of Czechowajian, the _Jagi/ququeen_ were increased by no less than eight drug-pen on 1 July 1938. Based on newly regulated substrate aircraft, these _Grappen_ were:

## Appendix B Bf 109E 'Emil'

Because of continued teething troubles and poor reliability of the DB 60 coupled with the manufacturer's confidence that the more powerful DB 60 would be in full reduction by the summer of 1938, the decision was made to pass out production of the NB60. The first two BT 109E0 production at management, redesigned VIA 75, powered by DB 601A - engines are rated 1,050, at a rate of 1,050, began trials during the summer of 1938, Equiped with a 680ch test injection system, a reproduction batch of eight BT 109E0 triggers were completed during the tail of 1938 and production after an average soon ready to come down the assembly line. Before it became obvious that the promised delivery date of production DB 60 powering would not be met. It airplanes were intact already coming down the assembly line. Rather than interbeat production, nearly completed airplanes were put into storage awaiting engine delivery. Essentially similar to its predecessor of the firewall, the EMI in the coproporated a completely redesigned lower coating section into which the oil cover was moved, the thin radiator was moved to the wings where we have shallow glycol radiators were provided. As with the C and D, E at ramanar was standardised on a pair of coupling-mounted MG 17s and a pair of wing-mounted MG 17s. Surprisingly, even though pilot armor protection was encountered in the Russian 1-6 over Spain, no such protection was provided for either pilot or fuel tankage.

It was not until some six months later than scheduled that the DB 60 was finally certified for a single-night flight flight flight. Without delivery of the power plants finally del begin, large numbers of the new tighter quality checks per example to the _Legging_ software which determines being made to the _Legging_ CodeF simultaneously. Throughout the spring and summer of 1938 the _Legging_ software worked frequently to convert the new tighter.

As badly as the illustrated method the new figure, the height apparently needed hard currency more. During the winter of 1938-39 Switzerland was allowed to produce 10 mature powered Bf 109E0 and an order of thirty BT 109E-15. In 1941, the 1958 lines were delivered and Swiss autoduels, obviously suppressed with their new machines, immediately supplemented their previous order with an order for an additional first?

During the whole of 1938 Bf 109E004 just barely crop over the 402 mk. However, with the introduction of the DB powder series the production tenupole increased to as extent at nearly 1100 aircraft were delivered during the first eighth months of 1938. During this period triggers were being delivered almost faster than the _Legging_ software only shown them. The _LYellow 2, an E-1 of 40 21 (later - 30 54) illustrates the standard color scheme of the _Tag-2_ color (by _Figure_4) at this time. Still careful the \(A\) series at these points, which could catch the barfaction at the ground, all sources which could be seen from this if were painted in Dark Green (Hypolest Green 70) with Light Blue (only undersurfaces.

## Assault on the West

By late spring of 1940 the _Jaggripen_ coupled claim nearly a thousand BT 109E-1s and E-3s on strength, the earlier B, C and Ds having been relegated to such second-line roles as an infighting or traning. On B/A right the _SitzRange_ game is an end when the German luppeant attacked Denmark and Norway under order to effectively seal of the eastern portion of the North Sea. The shipment of iron from Sweden to the Reich would be shielded from interference by Allied sea power. The only BT 109E-equequed unit to participate in the section was U30/7.

On 10 May 1940 the _Lufufrative_ committed sixteen _Grupper_ of BT 109E-from nine _Geschwederst_, 01, a 1, 2, 2, 62, 71, 51, and 54, MG 17Being busy in Norway, nearly a thousand BT 109E-out to total 3900artedartedarted supporting German ground forces which quickly overhaul. Belgium and Luxembourg. On the last Hildan returned after a 10,000 casualties, herive along he hebback out after the first day of fighting. By the 14th Novosti's papers, having simply bypassed the Maighton Line, opened a fifty mile from west of Sea. Godiera showed his item and armor hard, reaching the Atlantic on the 20th and effectively isolating the British Expedition Force. Ground forces immediately began beginning the circle around the heliogued Allied forces. Cutoff from the large French army, Allied troops, French, Belgian, Dutch and English, began to fall back toward Dunkirk, where the decision was made to evacuate them.

From the opening, the _Lufrative_ is a superiority in the air as in little doubt, although occasionally French and English squadows would again the upper hand. British and French fought fought courangously but due to the rapidly growing room battle. Allied air units repeatedly had to abandon bases and equipment or face capture. Allied airfields, logistics and communications were constantly under attack with more Allied flights being lost to striating and abandonments when were lost in actual combat. And Gom was taken for different and different, to 14 May 0.53 alone claimed by Gallagher, M.S., that of the events in which would become battle-tested air leaders throughout the coming year was out there first kills during this period; Adolph Gallant, Gunther Fall, Max-Helmuth Ostafern, to mention only a few.

As the lighting closed around Dunkirk, the _Jaggripen_; its supply lines stretched taut, began to feel the attrition which the previous two weeks of constant fighting had taken on men and aircraft, while actual combat states were only among 147 different aircraft during the whole of air, with a further B damaged, seriously was becoming a problem - some parts and even fuel became critical for some units. The same units closing a zones of torn around Dunkirk were in the same situation, many units were operating at less than half strength, fuel and ammunition were both in short supply and to the south near two-thirds of the French army, if somewhat disappearing, was still intact.

On 24 May 1940 the _Jaggripen_ of the Panorce Districts hatted. Goring, however, based that his Lufturie alone could destroy the British at Pulmitrke form the air and prevent their evacuation, on 20, 23 and 24 May the BT 169 was to meet its north enemy - the _Stillite_ - the first time, a memit that would go 17 at all the coastal days. During these initial conditions the Messershott fighter came out about even. However, in a dogtight just south of Dunkirk, Mo. 2 Squadron, flying its first operational source, claimed to have just six BT 109E, destroying all of them for the loss of only one of their own. While it is felt these claims, made during the heat of battle, were probably exaggerated. Untrative plots found that for the first time they were up against a well-trained energy possessing an air-carat equal to their own.

Beilieving that there was no way of the beaches for the several hundred thousand Allied troops, Goring's attack was slow to develop. However, since 20 May, the British Admiralty had been assembling a huge fleet of small vessels; tugs, motor launches, paddle steamers, shutting any vessel, civilian or military, that was capable of crossing the Channel. Under the node name Dynamer, the raigata marks was ordered to begin evacuating troops from Dunkirk. That same night Guardian was ordered to resume the Panzer assault.

## Looking Across

the Channel

Not able to stop the evacuation of Dunkirc solely with his _Luffre_, Getting felt this was the time to invade England. On S June the _FelzenshipNet_ has a conference aboard his armed train outlining a plan that he wanted to take to the _Felmer_:

Five Army divisions to reinforce the existing parachotic divisions plus five further divisions organized into his six division Approe. The _Luffre_ fighters, bombers and transports would be brought to an immediate state of readiness. By using these forces the entire Routar Navig and Royal Air Force would be forced to the Channel and into a fight to the Irish. The _Luffre_ code then be used to stop them.

At the end of these desives battles both sides would have found themselves without anything left-and then, with our reserves, with a mere handful of the 5th and 5th Airplane Divisions, we would bring about the final decision.

Herman Goring

Hitter rejected any plan to immediately invade England and began putting out peace leaders, hoping the British would realize that the game was lost. No one in the _Luffre_ had the slightest idea that the English widot not immediately accept such a magnanimous of. The plots at _the 43draftraft_ were ready to "Home" the _Rice_'s to render their right deserved honors. Then the impossible happened. The British said, "No!". General attention among the _Luffre_'s water has that it was "moughing. How could he Tommies be so they were placed on both our view up" but now what?". The _Luffre_ plots were of course just as enthusiastic about coming to origins with the RAF as they were about going home in gory, perhaps a bit more so.

Goring's personal train, in which he outlined his suicidal plan to invade England. Given the state of the English forces at the time, doing's plan just might have worked. (Earlow)To achieve that own shortage of trained personnel, the _Lo/trafficle_ immediately began recruiting French children airframe mechanics who usually need near the former French Air Force bases and were quite willing to up their trade for their new master, especially after considering the alternatives.
