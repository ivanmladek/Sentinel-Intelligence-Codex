## Introduction

There is little doubt that the German air rad carried out in broad daylight on 13 June 1917 made a strong impression on the British War Office, since London itself had been there largely only eight days later the decision was made to increase the strength of the Royal Flying Corps to a total of thirty-two quadrants, the majority of these to be day-bounce units with which regulatory attacks could be made against German targets.

In that same month a new machine, intended to replace the proven de Havilland 4 home, made its first flight at London, North London. This new design was the D.H.B, described as being faster, and capable of carrying a greater load over an increased range.

Except for a difference in the two countries, the D.H.B closely resembled the earlier D.H.B further, the alterations to the cowling having been brought about by the early adoption of new and unproven 230 hp Siddiedge engine, a lightened version of the B.H.B.P. (Beardmore-Halford-Palherytt powerful the first production versions, the new engine, however, soon proved to be incapable of delivering the 300 hp expected of it.

The new de Havilland 9 retained the same wings and until a rise is predecessor, but the fuseluge was completely redesigned with the pilot and owner now positioned closer together. This arrangement also allowed for an improved forward view no longer obstructed by the wings, as well as permitting immediate communication between the crew. In addition, a measure of engine temperature control was now possible with the aid of a retractable traidator mounted beneath the nose, a refinement not incorporated in the earlier D.H.H. from which the D.H.B had been developed. Indeed, the prototype of the new bomber had been created by extensive modification of a D.H.A.759, which finally arrived at Martinsham (Section 11). October of 1917. The fuseluge forward section was plywood covered and the rear section consisted of a fabric covered by grier, except for the portion under the ultimate which was plywood covered. Armament consisted of a fuel forward firing, 303 h/h Cityes xanthine and an a flexible 303 h/h Lewis gun on a Scarff No. 2 ring mount in the rear cockp.

It quickly became clear, however, that all was not well with the new type, for one of the first reports to be issued in tests indicated that even without its internal bond, the D.H.B was only capable of a maximum speed of some 110 mph compared with the 106 mph achieved by the D.H.A., powered by a similar engine, at a like altitude and with a load of b.b. Even so, the pressures of war demand that such not bello is ignored, and

The first D.H.B produced by Alico, C6061, during its test period in November 1917. The aircraft was shipped to France in the following month for operational evaluation by Mo 27 Squadron. In many weeks also been tried by other units since it did not return to England until the end of February 1918.

the first production D.H.9 was soon sent to France for operational evaluation by No 27 Squadron which received C6051 in December of 1917.

Meanwhile, the possibility of powering the D.H.9 with a Fiat A.12 engine was being investigated, and although a number of these engines were delivered, it was made clear at the time that the Sididey Pumus was regarded as primary engine for the D.H.9, and the Italian engine was to be to more than an emergency substitute should the supply of Pumus fail. Even so, some D.H.9 was free third in 260 Piants. Even though there were signs that the new type was unlikely to meet the desired criteria, production went hand, despite warnings by mei like Major-General Salmond, who had an intense dislike of the type and stated that it would be outclassed by June of 1918. Opinions such as these were scattered on behalf of the Government by Sri William Wei. We show no late clear that it was to be the D.H.9 or nothing, as the Air Board had decided in favor of the type and orders for large numbers that already been placed. As a result the type was in service with operational squads in France by April of 1918, although the frequency with which engine failures were reported meant that the D.H.4, which the D.H.9 was intended to replace would have to be retained in service alongside the new bomber. Problems with the RIP engine, resulted from the fact that it was virtually obsolete by the time it had been proposed in sufficient numbers. Indeed, the first example would not even fit the D.H.4s for which they had originally been intended, and had to be rebuilt.

In addition to service in France, from where D.H.9s were operated as the key members of the RAF's Independent Air Force to make strategic attacks on the Rhine industrial centers, they were soon to be found in the Palestine and Macedonian heaters, as well as engaged in anti-Zepplein patrols at home and on submarine-hosting in British waters. Later they would be used to inaugurate the mail service for the Army of Occupation across the English Channel, only a few weeks after the signing of the Armusice in November of 1918.

As a consequence of the vast quantity of D.H.9s (over 3,000) which were constructed to replace D.H.4s, a huge stock became available for the victim malaria, not only ex-RAF medicines that matches struck of charge in favor of the later D.H.9A (a type that owned more to the D.H.4 than the D.H.9) but also a large number of D.H.9Ash which were set aside for disposal fresh from the assembly lines.

As a result, the type was quickly prepared for use by a number of embryo air forces, including the South Africa, which operated as interesting variant, or were employed by the very-emerging civil at transport world. Many of these machine were converted to multilayers and some were out-fitted as such prices. The first cabus were unlegalized, making it was necessary for passengers to wear long protective leather costs, heavy gloves, helmets and goggles.

Of the first four criteria entered on the British Civil Register in 1919 after the adoption of an antibacterial identification system, three were D.H.9s; G-ESAAAA (ex- C6054), AAC and "AAD, Indeed, the last surviving aircraftly D.H.9s was probably the machines used for early flight reflecting trials by Alan Coburn until 1934. Three years later it is recorded as having the Raieword aeronomic to convert with the Empire Air Day celebrations. It was finished in a Pale Mavice color scheme with a deeper shade of the same color for the turtle deck and lettering. The lettering on the upper wings was described as being very closely spaced.

## The D.H.9 Goes to War

By the time that the Royal Air Force was formed on 1 April 1981, almost four hundred D.H.9s had been constructed, although none had seen action against the enemy. The type never saw active service with the precursor of the RAF, the Royal Flying Corps which ceased to exist with the formation of the new British air arm. Before its dissolution, however, the RFC had begun to form new bother squadars to be equipped with the new day bomber, and over third half already gone to France. Eventually, a total of twenty-seven squadars were to be equipped with the type, with those of No 200 Squadron being the first to see action, making two attacks on the Don railway station on 2 April. This was soon followed by assaults against other targets, and a week later the unit was joined by the D.H.9s of No 89 Squadron for rids on German installations. German installations of communication became subsequent targets, being shielded in the main with 1120 pound, and it was at this time between the roi
C1230 made a force landing due to engine failure at the School for Aerial Flighting. The aircraft serial number on the rudder has one style of tettering for the number and a different style for the prefix letter. The aircraft was examined by British Ace James B. McCudden. reportedly it interested him because he had flown a similar aircraft (C1215) on 14 May 1918. (J.B.McCudden via E.F. Chessman)

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:14]

This D.R.S (P1255), probably on the ramace at Bickendorf, was a late production machine constructed under sub-contract by the famous London store, Warting and Gillow. Several machines of this batch were sent to overseas governments including Australia, India, New Zealand, Belgium, Greece and Poland. One aircraft from this batch is currently on exhibit in Paris.

No records have been traced concerning this D.R.S, but it is unusual in that it carries a thick Black bar marking under both lower wing surfaces. Flight leader streamers were carried on the rear, outer wing struts. The aircraft in the background are Southly Camel figures.

## Engine Change

The unreliability of the of the Puma engine meant that as early as mid-September of 1917 a search was begun for an alternative power plant. The first such installation was made using an InRain 250 bp Flat engine at the beginning of the following year, however, only a small unknown number of D1H9s were actually fitted with the Flat. The 230 bp Galloway Adriatic engine was another alternative being studied.

In fact the need for an engine change became a parallel story to that of the aircraft's development. As plans were made to build the type in the United States, where 14,000 were ordered as USD9-t, it was decided that these aircraft were to be powered by 400 bp Liberty 12-A engine. In other countries too, the need to adapt the airframe to alternative engines was followed with some real, resulting in the fitting of either 420 bp Bristol Jupiter VI direct-drive engines, or 460 bp Jupiter VII planet engines to D1H9s in South Africa resulting in versions which were significantly different from the original engine. These aircraft had role undercharges, arrest-connected airces, rounder rear locking and center-section gravity tanks. As a result of these changes, they were re-named as Mphalas. They were to remain in service, later as trainers, into 1937.

Indeed, the need to investigate alternative power plants was even felt in the civil field.

resulting in the introduction of the D1H9 during the mid-1920s. These were powered by 14 cylinder, twin-row Armstrong Siddeley Jagur III air-cooled, radial engines. Also used forA D.H.9 experimentally powered by a 250 h eight A-12 engine. One thousand of these engines were ordered in August of 1917 as stand-by supplies for the D.A.4 and D.M.8. Unfortunately, they did not became available in numbers until well into 1916, only nine being reportedly available at the beginning of the year. This may be 6052, the first D.H.9, to be re-engled.

## Overseas

Despite its well-known shortcomings, all of which stemmed from its unreliable engine, the D.H.9 was to be found in the air forces of many countries, perhaps the most interesting of these being Belgium, the only country outside Great Britain to use the type operationally. Had the First World War listed longer, however, the United States built examples would have been operating with the American Expedition Force. These aircraft would have been powered by the American Liberty engine under the designation USD.9. In the event, only nine had been built at McCool Field (August 4006) to 40085 before proving was canceled. In addition, only four (three being 40044, 40118 and 40119) were built by Dayton Wright before this contract was also canceled. It is known that the U.S. Naval Northern Bombing Group had four such aircraft in October 1991, which had been assembled on the Naval Air Station at Pouillac. The unit, attached to the Fifth Group, RAF used them in eight bombing attacks conducted during that month and in the opening days of November.

The last RAF D.H.9s to see action were the twelve aircraft serving with "Z Force", a British unit operating with the Camel Corps against the "Mad Mall Mall" in Somal for three weeks in January and February of 1920. Bombing missions by D.H.9s to directly see the Mull's capture.

In addition, D.H.9s formed part of "Imperial Gifts" going to various parts of the Commonwealth, including Australia (heventy-eight), Canada (six) and New Zealand (nine). The forty-eight aircraft presented to South Africa later received a new sense of life due to new engine installations.

D.H.9s also served as part of the RAFs contingent with Denikits's White Russian Army, Twenty-eight D.H.9s received the Australian da prefix. Seven aircraft that were recorded at Point Cook were 19238; 20187; 03191; 103207; 03220; 03220; 03220; 03220; 03220; and 032205. The first integrate light flights in Australia were made by the type in 1926, but four years later none were left in service. Four aircraft that had been given to aero-clubs remained in service and were not scrapped until 1933. (Colin Owers)

Other foreign air forces also used the D.H.9 including Poland (wenty-two), the Netherlands East Enlos (at least forty-six), Spain, Estonia, Japan (one), Eine (eight), Greece, Afghanistan, Chile, Iran, Latvia, Peru, Runamista, Switzerland (three) and the Nel.

In Poland the aircraft was used in combarting the 1920 war with the Soviet Union. The

 aircraft operated with the soh of Solutions of the 3rd Aviation Wing, flying low level bombing and starling missions against Cossack cavity units. The D.H.9s remained in service until the end of 1920, when the surviving aircraft were placed in storage. In 1924, they were retrabished and offered for safe. Five were used to Eleatia. Five other aircraft were retained and issued to the 4th Air Regiment as trainers.

The Estonian aircraft arrived too late to see combat when Estonia was invaded by the Soviet Union in 1919, however, the D.H.9s were to have a long and active role in Estonian service. The aircraft were used for animal flights between Estonia and Finland and the last D.H.9 in service was lost in a crash during 1933.

Spain not only acquired a number of surplus D.H.9 airframes, they also produced the aircraft under license. Spanish D.H.9s differed from standard aircraft in that they were re-engined with 300 D Br Brugino-Suzia engines, which led to a modification of the nose contours. The Spanish D.H.9s also saw combat in North Africa, flying against rebels in Spanish Morocco. By the time of the Spanish Civil War, the aircraft had been reeligned to the training role, and both sides used the aircraft for that mission during the war.

A RNZAF D.H.9 (serial 5636) shares the grass with two D.H.9s. New Zealand accepted nine D.H.9s during 1920, including ex-RAF F85609; 19627 (alter G-AZAZ); H6563 (ZAD); H5672 (ZAD); D3136 (ZAH) and D3139 (ZAH)This D.H. 9 (serial D2803) is believed to have crashed at Petrovsk in January of 1919, killing 2nd Lieutenant Machin. The overpainted round on the upper port using tip is unusual as is the letter on the tailplane which seemingly augments the individual identification letter "I" above and on the sides of the fuselage. (K. Molos)

The RAF* "Z" Force, the final British operators of the D.H.8, included this aircraft, D3117, also marked as aircraft # on the forward fuselage. This D.H.9 was converted to an air ambulance capable of carrying two patients. The men wear sun helmets and the protective spine pads in use during 1920. The normal cut-out in the trailing edge of the upper wing center-section has been taired in.

## Presentation Aircraft

All nations engaged in both World Wars adopted the policy of encouraging the public to subscribe for weapons, perhaps due to the immense monte value of permitting citizens to feel personally involved in confining the enemy. In Great Britain this great achieved popularity when he was combined with the romantic attitude that surrounded flying, which had only became possible in heavier than air machines because years before the First World War broke out.

As a gesture of gratitude and recognition aircraft "perahased" in this way by towns, cities communities and wealthy individuals in the British lites and abroad from Aden to Zanibur were marked with the manner of the donor, who was also presented with a photograph of the relevant aircraft daily marked, and to this end a large number of sign writers and photographers involved in order to meet the official pledge.

By July and August of 1918, however, the practice had assumed such proportions that it ceased to be operathe. As a result, it was directed that aircraft "perahased" by towns and Army this should have strips of fabric bearing the serial number of the machine subscribed before a photograph with scale irrespective of the real serial identity of the of the specimen involved. But whether a donor's name was ever added subsequently when the machine bearing the correct number became available in 1strown and indeed seems to be in some doubt. In addition, photographs exist which plashy show aircraft with hand-painted donors names combined with serial numbers clearly added by means of fabric strips. This seems in contradiction of the official explanations offered at the time.

Even so, some nine hundred "presentation" aircraft of all types have been traced, indicating both the magnitude of operating the scheme and is popularity which reached its summit at much the same time as the D.H.9 was being produced in numbers. A cursory count reveals some forms of this type marked as presentation aircraft.

## Appendix Dope and Development

The appearance of the D.H.9 coincided with the an upsurge in the development of the technical side of military aviation with the result that, representing as it did the embodiment of the latest thinking in design (a claim that was not endorsed by actual practice) several samples of the type were pressed into one for units of new equipment, and in a least two cases, investigation into fresh approaches to the question of camouflog/concealment. These experiments

**This D.H.9 was probably used by the No 49 IDS (Training Depot Station) at Getterick and, although almost indistinguishable, to carried the name "Lobster" on the nose in White. It also carried a zig-zag okaze point scheme on the tuesque. The two D.H.9s in the background are believed to be D2904 and beyond that possibly D1746.**

**This is an Alcro-built D.H.9 (serial D2904), but the reason for the United States star insignia on the cowling is unknown. Certainly it was never found by the U.S. Army. From a comparison of total values it is believed that the fin, balance area of the rudder and wheels were kept, with a white outline. The lower longens and parts of the docking and nose are clear dope. (M. Moston)** involved the use of specially-applied patterns rather than the employment of single overall colors, or combinations of colors.

In the former field, one of the more interesting sets of trials were those carried out concerning an addition to the instrument flying instrumentation of the day. The new instrument was called the Static Turn Indicator and one was fitted to the Flat engine test bed at Oxfordness. Other experiments centered on the practicability of issuing parachuster for arrives, luxuries up to that time in official disfavor, except for observers in captive balloons.

This unidentified D.R.9 aboard the British aircraft carrier HMS ARX ROVAL. In September 1929, has fallen forward on the vessel's catapult. It is in poor condition, heavily patched, and new post-war national markings with all main components marked with a letter "B", with one of these obliterating the rudder serial number. Whether it has an engine is not clear, but it is certainly stripped of all equipment and has no wheel covers or times. It is believed that this was a test airframe that was intended to be lost at sea during catapult trial incunches.

The over-painted "A" of No 211 Squadron, RAF can still be made out on the forward luesque of this D.M.3 (B7820). The aircraft was intended on 27 June 1918 and used a "cell 433" by the Netherlands which obtained and operated "detail 443" (formerly 03251) and "detail 446" (03271) in the same manner. The national marmings were Orange.

Another D.M.3 that landed in neutral Holland on 27 July 1918, was 20271, side code "M" of No 211 Squadron. The crew was Sergeans (good "plot) and Parridge (observer). Sergean Parridge was served wounded when the aircraft was hit over Zeebrugge and died of his wounds a few days later.

## D.H.9c

The D.H.9cC designation was used by de Havilland to cover conversions of ex-military D.H.9/c for civil passenger use. These aircraft were modified with an additional cockpit in front of the pilot and a rearward extension of the observer's cockpit, enabling the aircraft to carry three passengers, mail or right freight, access to the rear cockpit was gained by the use of a fixed bordering ladder on the staudaud side of the Tueshage. There were a number of different D.H.9c configurations, so that the rear cockpit covered with a wood and fabrics cabin over. Other D.H.9c's were made by the Dipersonal Company and were simply military aircraft with error cockpit, all in a row. Some six of these were later supplied to Romania.

At this point in development of the D.H.9c, it was felt that there was a need to compensate for the art movement of the center of gravity and the wings were given eight inches of swept back measured at the outer inteplane stout.

With all military equipment removed, the maximum weight of the D.H.9c was some 120 weight higher than the minimum D.H.9. The aircraft's maximum speed was 115 mph, crushing speed was 95 mph, the ceiling was rated at 19,000 feet and range was listed at 500 miles.

Some eight D.H.9c were used by the Havilland Aerospace Hire Service, flying hundreds of hours all over Europe. Other D.H.9c's were used as trainers for Royal Air Force reserve pilots. These remained in service between 1923 and 1924 before being replaced by purpose modified D.H.9c's root seat trainers.

The D.H.9c was introduced by the parent company during 1921. The aircraft had accommodation for two passengers on heating seats in the rear, and room for a third passenger or engineer in a cockpit in front of the pilot. This D.H.9c, registered **G-EBDO**, was operated by the Heavilland Hire Service from 16 June 1922, the day its civilian certificate of Alworthiness was issued. The passengers boarded the aircraft by means of the fixed ladder mounted on the fuselage side.

## Preserved Aircraft

Despite the fact that over thirty squadres of D.H.9s were planned (but never achieved) and that it existed at a time when many would survive the war and could be expected to enjoy longevity in the civilian field, only three examples of the type now exist. One of these is I.S. S. A.H.9s had been modified as a trainer in South Africa, where the type was still to be found as late as 1993. This preserved machine was the last of the forty-eight which were part of an Imperial Gitton South Africa delivered during 1920.

Of the remaining pair, only one represents the D.H.9s at it appeared over the trenches of the Western Front. This aircraft (serial F1258) was powered by a puna engine and built under sub-counted by the London furniture manufacturers of Waring 6 Gillow during 1918. It is now exhibited in the La Grande Gallery at El Burgess, France. It was a presentation machine subscribed for by A. Battery, 2ndige Sariley Reserve Brigade and carries the presentation on the nature of the shattered. It wasautifully restored in recent years and is the only authentic representative of a First World War D.H.9 existing in the world.

The final source represents an aircraft as used in the civilian field for pioneering flights around the globe. It is the former F1278 with shown by Leutamens J. C. McIntosh and R. J. P. Parer from England to Australia in 1920. The first single opening aircraft to complete time. It was originally purchased from the stock of warings warplanes held by the Aircraft Disposal Company at Wadon, Surrey. Such were the rigos of the journey that it took some even months to complete the flight. Acquired by Peter's old school by the Australian War Museum, it was unfortunately allowed to detect over time, and it was only saved by the work and study involved on it over a thirteen year period by the Australian Society for Aeronautical Preservation. It is now an almost perfect representation of its original super-arcarc-, although details of the nearby obliened loops on the interplane struts are still sought. Indeed, so accurate is the restoration that the uneven application of the registration, G-EAOM has been copied.
