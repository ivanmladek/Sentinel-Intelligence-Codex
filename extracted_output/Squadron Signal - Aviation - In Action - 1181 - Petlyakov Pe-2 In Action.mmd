## 6 Pethylakov Pe-2 Series 1

On 25 May 1940, the Technical Council of GUAP1 issued specifications for a five-bonber with a speed of 550 kmin (341.8 Myr) at 5000 M (16,404.2 feet). This new aircraft was urgent-by required to replace the aging Tupole'S B-2-bomber, Vladimir M. Petylakov and his design team performed under great pressure. No prototype was built and production of the new dive-bomber began December in December of 1940.

Pethylakov's team described the V1-100 high-altitude fighter prototype into the PB-100 dive-bomber, which the VVS designated the Pe-2-T. most noticeable change affected the crew's climb, which was moved further forward and became much shorter than on the V1-100. The water was started at and to standwind of the pilot and rammed for 6.280h SACs machine upon mounted in the ctt among seconds. The entire tower were scotech was placed to provide a view for bomb mining. The risestage was converted to house a bomb by. original role as a heavy fighter restricted the thermal bomb bomb of 600 to 600 kmin (3122 pounds), the largest being being 250 k (501.50) ground-E3950. The bomb were dropped with the electrically operated ESP86.6 bomb release and the mechanically operated emergency DSNL-304 release. With four jobs added to the wing underswarmers between the engine needles held as additional 400 k (58.18 pounds) of bombs. This brought the Pe-2's maximum bomb load to 1000 E (236.69 seconds).

The Pe-2 added a third crew crewmeter to operate the RSB-_divis_' radio and to man 7.62km SHAS annealing in gap in 34.26 hc/minute vertical position. This was splitted into the groove. Two 6220h SACs had 58.428h SACs making guns were mounted in the nose. An SPV-3 intercection system allowed voice communication between three three crew members.

Early proton-Fe-2 had a winning Tupole'S 1.54 (65.36 ), a length of 12241 s (40.6), etc. and a high 5.324 (12.66 ). had a size of 40.5 (435.95 square feet), etc. and a high 5.324 (12.66 ). hands up size of 40.5 (435.95 square feet). The Pe-2 was powered by two 100 mV Kimov M-108E 12-cylinder, liquid-cooled, inline engines.

This had a nominal ground level power rating of 1020 in. While V1-100 and a V18-42 propeller, the Pe-2 was equipped with a three-blended VISH-617 variable pitch propeller. The 6.244 (_Game Domestic Extensional Personal Personal_), Chief Professor of the Aviation Industry

engine convings and the mencks were also completely redesigned from the prototype, with the nucelles extended at ht to carry a 100 x00 (220.5 pound) bomb. Dive brakes fitted under the wings-outboard of the engine mencks slowed the Pe-2-s descent. Five fuel tanks with a total capacity of 1008, (1286.9 gallos) were fitted in the mid-fuselescope section and wings. The **Pe-2 Series I** had a maximum speed of 560 auh (235.5 s/m) at 5500 and 445 x280 (280.9 s/m) at sea level. Its service ceiling was 8800 x (287.14 f/o) and its range was 1200 x04 (745.7 miles). The take off distance of the Pe-2 was 620 x (2034.1 f/o) and it landed at 230 x04 (142.9 s/m). A wider lange gear was installed on production Pe-2s; however, the bunching problem in masing were tilted throughout the air-set's service career.

The Pe-2-speed approximately 50 detectors to open and close the radiator flaps, alter the propellers' pitch, and drive various pumps, valves, and flaps. Moreto show we fitted to the AP-1 drive automatic control system, which extended the drive blades 970 and then closed them. At the end of 1940, the first Pe-2-series I had left the assembly line at GGAF (_Grandes_) arrives at 1940. Similar Zoos's, Pakistan Factory 22 hit, Fan Moscow. The German firm Junkers built aircraft in GAZ 22 for Soviet and foreign customers between 1921 and 1927. This was due to the prohibition against aircraft propulsion in Germany by the Miles Alliance displayed after World War one. In the spring of 1941, GAZ 124 at Kazan began Pe-2 production, GAZ 93 at Moscow-Rhidas switched production from the unreliable Bush-3P (**I-I**) heavy buncher to the Pe-2-bat mixer. It was also planned to build the Pe-2 at GAZ 44 at Kharkov in the Ukraine; however, the entire plant was evacuated eastward after the German division on 22 June 1941 before a single Pe-2 was produced.

The first change in the production line was introduced in the **Pe-2 Series I**. The surround measure was changed from the 762ab SNAs machine gun on the 12,72ab NAS (_Uchirror_) _or its Bernstein Environment_; Universal Bersen Springhoined machine gun. The SP-based SNAs were customized. A V1B-2 mount with a 1247 bugs on replaced the MB-2s retractable-vantal position with a 7.62baM SNAs. The next production line change occurred with the 100 x000 Klinux 10-80x engine, which replaced the 100 in our M-1084 postview. The M-1084 postview for a common firing.

The port wing drive brake is deployed on this early Pe-2. Both the port and starboard brakes lowered 90 to steady the aircraft's descent during dive boming attacks. The Pe-2s give speed never exceeded 600 x00 (872.8 s/m) during tests with the drive brakes. This dye have was standard on most Pe-2 Doppler and reconnaissance variants.

through the propeller shaft, however, no such weapon was fitted to the Pe-2.

In the spring of 1941, the first Fe-2- centered operational service with the 95th _Bonumberton'sni_ variation _v1_fold (BAV: Bonumber Aviation Regiment) of the VVS. This work is underway by over 260 Square during the 1 May 1941 particle in Moscow, which marked the Pe-2's public debut. When the Wennurch (German Armed Forces) invaded the Soviet Union on 22 June 1941, 458 Pe-2's had been produced, however, only 42 Pe-2's was assigned to the critical Military Diserts of the Western Soviet Union. Due their inexperience, most of the pilots were unable to efficiently measure the Pe-2 and no due the bombing missions were born. On the day of the German attack, 1 Pe-2's has the 5th BAT destroyed a more or more true River Separating Roman and the Soviet Apollo of Mouzus (now Moldova). It was one of the few successful Pe-2's missions down during the first days of the Great Patritic War (the Soviet Sea that is 1941-45 Eastern Pet of World War Two).

The Lluafurte (German Air Force) captured one Pe-2 early in the campaign and fleve it to the Lluafurte's Test and Research Center at Rochlin, Germany. This Pe-2 crushed during one of the German test flights in September of 1941.

Finnish Pe-2 Series

During the first days of Operation BARARARARARAR (Germany's invasion of the Soviet Union), the German Lluafte had carried several Instant Pe-2's Series 1 aircraft. Some of these Petlyakovs were evaluated at various Lluafurte organizations. The German head captured so many operation Pe-2's Series 1 is stu as the powerse west sof to Finland. It was originally intended that Finnish pilots should form the Pe-2 free from the storage depot at which in eastern Poland (now Belvards et Finland. When the Finnish specialists arrived to inspect the aircraft, then became clear that the Soviet Brothers first noted a general event) occurred with this erosion, all six Pe-2 were maintained at Puska and shipped to Finland up 10 December 1941.

These Pe-2's arrived at the _KleinforceforceLusk/_(VLS: State Aird Factory) at Tampere, Finland on 10 January 1942. The aircraft were scheduled and assigned the _Informational_ (Final Air Force) series PE-2's to Pe-2's. Finland was the only country besides the Soviet Union to use the Pe-2's in combat during World War Two, Several _Informational Pe-2's were invited with a unique Finnish modification, a gunsight placed on a his-ironet in front of the standard energy frame.

All these Pe-2 were allocated to the _Informational_ _S^unnellington_ (PLPLV: Bonumber Squadron) as at Mouzus. Finland. They greatly measure commissionance and photographic missions, but Finnish Pe-2's also carried out bombing missions against Soviet targets in northwest 1941.

A further Pe-2's Series 1 (PE-2's) was acquired by Finland in early 1944. German forces are believed to have captured this aircraft early in the Great Patritic war and it remained for a time in a storage depot in the East. In 1943, the Pe-2 series is displayed as our bowy in the main space of Olomo (Olomoia in German), Mouzus (Oo) Kenpillo. Subsequently, the Pe-2 was taken to the Flagger

A more rounded propeller splitter was fitted to the VISB-61P propeller, replacing the conical spinners used on earlier P-2 variants. Two additional heat outlets were placed atop the atop nine anestcles of the P-2 Series 83 and subsequent variants. Single mounting forces for 76.2MUR.5A machine gains were placed in the fat breakage, replacing the two circular windows. Two square windows were detected from the upper rear fuselose. This variant retained the antenna wires, which run from the top of the antenna mounted on the canopy to the vertical sub-bilizers, Earlier P-2s had an auxiliary wire which ran from the port main wire antenna to the forward fascelore under the canopy. The P-2 Series 83 changes that allows isolation, so that it now ran from the antenna tank to the port canopy.

The combination of front-line modifications and poor production find-in-situ dramatically reduced the P-2 Series 83's performance over previous P-2 variants. The P-2 Series 83 had a maximum speed of 488 (803.2 ATM), which was 42 8am (261.3 ATM) slower than the P-2 Series 31 of August of 1941.

## Pe-2 Series 205

In early 1943, engineers at G227 \(\mu\)K taken began working to improve the Pe-2's aerodynamic qualities and speed. This program was done in close cooperation with ISAGET at Kartos, southeastern of Moscow, When the Great Participtive War (the Eastern Front of World War Two) began 22 new 1941, the Pe-2's Siemens 1's maximum speed of 5400 km (335.55 nm) at 5000 km (16,000.2 feet) was level with the German fly 100g/152. The 100g/5's maximum speed was 540.734 s (369.7) at 6000 km (16,000.1 feet). This situation changed in favor of the German flyers as the warted. The Pe-2's quality and resulting performance of declined partly due to the shortage of qualified aircraft construction workers. Added with from wood construction, more parting, and additional equipment also the boarde's performance. The Pe-2 Serre 59s, built in the summer of 1942, reached a maximum speed of 488 km (332.300 km); however, this was 142 km (88.2 km) slower than the 1906.5-630 km (91.950 km) at 6000 km (16,55.5 feet).

Increasing engine power was a parallel improvement to refining the Pe-2's aerodynamic qualities, The Pe-2 Serre 1979 introduced the 1210 m/ Klimov M-105P2-15/or, liquid, solid, inline engine. This peripheral method of the 1100 m/ M-105P engine and only previous Pe-2 variants, Klimov developed the M-105P7 for fabrics operating at 80 and medium altitudes, where most air could occurred over the Eastern Front. The M-105P7 had increased power at altitudes up to 2700 km (835.85.86), but also the drop of three main altitudes. This engine increased the Pe-2's speed by approximately 25 km (15.5 m/m) at sea level to 460 km (235.8 m/m).

TsaMI carefully tested a standard production Pe-2 in their T-101 wind tunnel at Kartos. These tests resulted in the recommendation of aerodynamic refinements to Petylakov's original 1022. _Game_(_Game_(_Game_(_Game_(_Game_(_Game_(_Game_(_Game_(_Game_(_Game_(_Game_(_Game_(_Game_(_Game_( _Game_(_Game_(_Game_(_(_Game_(_(_Game_(_((_((_(((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((( ((                                                                         0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 00 000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

Further modifications were made to the Pe-3\(bis\) before production began. The two 12.78mt UBR machine pins were moved from the nose to the breakage undercut, leaving the 200mt SAVAC common in the nose. Amuntion for the UBR was \(-265\) rounds for the port gap and 230 rounds for the stubward weapon - was loaded into the bomb bay. Making room for this ammonia reduced the breakage fuel than volume from 250. (16.6 gallos) to 100. (2.6 gallos). An asbestos-filled partition separating the fuel runs from the eventual meeting on aluminum two protected the test tank from overflowing and the weapons from fuel leaks. The P-3\(bis\) was also equipped with the VUB-1 near energy target - which included a 2.78mt UBT machine gap with 1800s - prior to that tuners' introduction on the Pe-2.

Both the 59th IA/P (Figure Aviation Regiment) of Ayagang and the BuI B (Bamber Aviation Regiment) at Kliokawa were equipped with Pe-3 by the prior of 1942. The 59th IA/P was assigned to the Northern Fleet and mostly provided tighter cover over the sea approaches the northern ports of Muramatsu and Archangel. Most Lead-Lead materials supplied by the United States and Great Britain were delivered to these ports, after running a gunted of German aircraft and ships hosted in Norway. The P-3\(bis\) was the Ossor Soviet fighter, with enough range for some things before the Baers Sca. The BuI B\(\beta\) provided fighter except for VIP (Very Important Person) aircraft carrying Soviet and Allied dignitudes throughout the Soviet Union.

Pe-3\(bis\) fibers were also assigned to the 13th and 121st IA/P. Four aircraft of the former unit showed a 180 and damaged a Fock-Vult W/20 crowd under subtle protective Allied dignitudes (by 28 to 19 September 1942. This engagement occurred near the money's destinations. Archangel, The P-3\(bis\) was also used in long-range reconnaissance missions, in addition to their primary long-range fighter studies.

One P-3\(bis\) damaged during a source protection mission and force handed in Frinship terrorio on 28 November 1942. The pilot was damaged and safely reached Soviet lines; however, the navigation was killed in the crash landing. The Finns repulsion the P-3\(bis\) and allocated to the serial number P-3\(\Omega\). It served with Pt.4. (_Vennennufactufacture_; Bember Squadron) 48 until 2 July 1944, when it was destroyed by a Soviet Pe-2 and in Laopermenta, Finland.

Pe-3\(\Omega\) and Pe-3\(bis\) production at GAZ 39 ended in March 1943, after 13 aircraft were built. The 14-heavy-bonnker succeeded the P-3\(bis\) on the fluktak production line. Pe-3\(bis\) fibers served in the reconnaissance role with the Soviet Northern Fleet after World War One ended in 1945. The _Safety1_ (Saudaudon) of the 574th Ossoror _Haydenkewled" grid _Arvisionist Foi_ (OMAR); Independent Maritime Reconnaissance Axiom Regiment retired the P-3\(\Omega\) in July of 1946. The Douglas **A-206** **Hayce** light bomber, supplied by the US under Lead-Lcase, replaced the P-3\(bis\) system.

**This pe-3\(bis\) was assigned to the 121st IA/P (Figure Aviation Regiment) of the Soviet Northern Fleet when it force-loaded in Finland on 28 November 1942. The aircraft was repaired, given the Finnish serial PE-3\(\Omega\), and assigned to Pt.4\(\Omega\) (Bember Squadron) 48. (_Quas Niska_)

## Pe-2R (Early Versions)

The Pe-2's maximum speed of 540 kms (335.5 mV) made it highly suitable for reconnaissance missions. During its production cycle, the reconnaissance version was updated with the same features as on the homaker variant, since the reconnaissance Pe-2s were built at GAZ (State Aircraft Factory) 22 Moscow-Fill using existing bomfer antennas.

The dedicated reconnaissance version of the Pe-2 was designated **Pe-2R (_Ravecrid_; _Ravecrid_; _Ravecrid_). The Pe-2R differed in a number of details from the bomber. This variant replaced the bomber's glender nose with a solid nose. The nose undersearting windows were retained for downward visibility by the crew; however, the side glazing was reduced to two small windows on each side. Dye brakes were not installed on the Pe-2R and flurings were placed over the mounting holes in the wings. Extremal bomb tracks were also deleted from the roomiss version, while a circular camera window was first in the eccentric bomb bay and doors.

The Pe-2R used several types of cameras, with the AFA-B as the standard vertical cameras. The radio operator activated by remote control from the cockpit. The AFA-B came with different settings; 1/5/4, and 4/5/4. All other daytime cameras included the AFA-1, which had a capability of 150 pictures, and the AFA-271T for oblique photography. The AFA-19 cameras was used for eight commissioners, switching the AFA-B. The Pe-2R carried up to eight FOTAB-50-351 flash bombs for these missions. The flash bomb's explosion triggered a sensor aboard the aircraft, which activated the AFA-91-yature. This camera could use up to 50 photographs during a single mission. The Pe-2R also used the AFA-3, along with American cameras supplied under Lend-lease to the Soviet Union during World War.

Two fed tanks with a total capacity of 580 (153.2 gallos) were added to increase the P-2R's range to approximately 2500 xu (1553.5 miles) - an increase of approximately 500 (310.7 miles) over the standard Pe-2-Pr. The reconnaissance variant was equipped with the AFA-1 occupied, which was not found on Pe-2 bombers. The AFA-1 maintained the flight path with a margin of one to two degrees. Several Pe-2R's were equipped with additional radio equipment, which allowed eases to directly report to headquarters during a mission. Early Pc-2R aircraft lacked the RPK-2 IF/DF (High Frequency/Direction Finding) receiver and its tendon-shaped firing under the nose.

The 2R's have current line their behavior counterparts, with the Pe-2R series 83 being fitted with a 1.2 Torr DATE machine gain in an FT gun mounting on the air canopy. The gun barrel's length prevented use of the at canopy glaring. Some Pe-2R's assigned to the 2nd DRAPA' were equipped with few 83-82 (_Ravecrid_) Standard Footing Assembly depicted rockets. These 82km (3.2 inch) overexposes were mounted on twin, anti-facing bunches on the upper and lower mid-baseline surfaces. The RS-2S were fired either individually or in saliva against pursuing aircraft. They were intended to explode in the air, hitting energy aircraft with shipment. It is unknown whether or not the Pe-2R's were successful attacking enemy aircraft with RS-83.

The Pe-2R was assigned in all Soviet Air Air mixes deployed to the cleaner Front. It served the NoFH, 33th, 39th, 39th, 39th, and 90th _Crypt/Outany_ (Staunders 3'BARPA), and with the 2nd DRA, 11th, 48th, and 72nd DRA. These nuts were also equipped with a few Pe-3 fibers specifically convert of the reconnaissance missions.

The 2nd DRA participated in the Red Army's assault on Berlin, which began on 16 April 1945. The current mode of the RS-2R's to carry a fourth crewmon, who operated four additional cameras mounted in the breakage. This aircraft's cameras took still photographs and motion picture flims of the battle, which were later shown worldwide.

## 74 Pe-2 Experimental Versions

### 75 Ski-Equipped Pe-2

In early 1942, the Petlyakov OKB (_Optynove Konstantvolkovkov Burer_: Experimental Construction Bureau) developed retractable sik for the Pe-2. A modified Pe-2 Series 11 (serial number 22 11) (15) served as the test bed. The engine accelerates new modified for the main undercasing sik, which retract nearly flush with the neceliest 'lower surfaces'. A smaller ski replaced the tail wheel and fully retractle into the all fuselage. A solid metal exposure replaced the rear canopy glazing, which was nicknamed the turf in views are too to its shape. The Pe-2 also carried a box glazing similar to that of Series 33 are located. The test bed also received the larger propeller stiffness typical for the Series 33. The ski-equipped Pe-2's upper surfaces were pointed in a temporary white winter camouflage, while lower surfaces remained light blue. The structured spinner was pointed black with the ski-equipped setting.

The evaluation trails held at Kara in early 1942 showed that the ski configuration was successful: however, combat experience showed that wheel-equipped Pe-2 bomers could operate with little problems on specially jeopard snow fields. The additional drag generated by the retractable siks and then 30.66 (65.8) pomely reduced the Pe-2's performance. The ski-equipped Pe-2 lost approximately 40 s/m (24.9 snu) and approximately 500 s/m (1640.4) feet) in ceiling compared to standard Pe-2s. This variant was soon cancelled.

The powertrain was a copy of the August-Schmidt 109-014 engine used on the German output and the wooden wings replaced the real wings of U-130X. The Red Arm Cygieur Array from 1946) regarded the V-1/03A as in different sequence. The 12.7m UBT machine gun was developed from the VUB-1 current on the stt canopy. (Zdenek Tritz)

In early March of 1945, the 1st Ukrainian Front2 captured several intact V-1s and their totaling components at the Hunting-Rastrow Factory Laboratory Gamma and at the Fermi vorks at Kluoreore, Poland. In April of 1945, V-1s lunches were discovered at Socket, near Setting, Germany (now Szeczni, Poland). The materials were transported to various institutions in Moscow and U-1s, Russia for further investigation.

On S August 1945, Soviet Leader Is Stillin ordered GAZ 01 is U build a copy of the V-1 under the designation 108X. The Society of the Grays-Shellin 109-014 pulse jet engine was designated the VPD-304. Several captured German specialists were brought to the Soviet Union to 43rd Tiscovery's design

Footnote 2: A front is the Soviet Russian equivalent of an Army Group (completed of two or more Armies) in Western animals.

Approximately 12 Pe-2s were used to flight test various components of the captured V-1 and the Soviet 108X flying bomb. The aircraft served in late 1942 when the flight test began in early December, One Pe-2 Series 359 served as a test bed for the VPD-304-pulse jet engine. The engine was mounted along the alt and fascage and tail section. This Pe-2 had the 12.7m-Bosten USBT machine gun removed from SUSUS-11 at Socket. Several test flights follower theory. The flight test with the VPD-304-309 event (see the XII VIII vs Kluore) in early 1946. (This airfield was renamed Zhukoyin in 1947)

The 108X flying bombs were flight tested in the Tashkent engine in UCBin. The Robot bombs were released in flight 108 Xbunches before the timed 108 X 

## Pe-2 Polish Engine Test Bed

In 1946, the Polish _Instructe Lotnicen_ (Avivation Institue) in Warsaw had developed a jet engine. This powerful was based on German technical information and hardware discovered in Poland after the end of World War Two.

A single _Polistic Wojna Lotnicen_ (PWL; Polish Air Force) Pe-2 Series 359 was allocated to the _Instructe Lotnicen_ as an engine test bed. The Pe-2 carried its standard military markings during the trials, however, the waist gun positions were deleted and replaced by windows.

The jet engine was mounted on an alloy tube framework appreciably 24 (6.6 feet) above the safe flexible. Several test flights were made; however, the program was later stopped such that it became clear that the Soviet Union would supply Poland with jet-powered fibers and bombers.

## Pe-2 Ejection Seat Test Bed

The Soviet Union's first jet flights were the Mikoyan-Gurevich **MG-9** and the Yakolev **Vak-15**. Both aircraft made their first flights only minutes apart - from Chikalovskaya on 24 April 1946, On 23 June 1947, test pilot Yuri Antitorov set a new Soviet air speed record when he fleving the **MG-9F**/ to 965 svm (599.6 svm). The high speeds of the new jet aircraft required a new form of emergency series for the pilot.

Sergei Lashin of the Mikoyan-Gurevich OUR (Experimental Construction Bureau) developed an election seal intended for use on the **MG-5**. This was Soviet's righter was under development and made its first flight on 20 December 1947.

After a number of state tests, the election seal was fitted into the rear fuselage section of a Pe-2 Series 359. This set occupied the former radio-operator compartment. The hatch on top of the fuselage was decided and replaced by a wider opening for the set and its occupants. This Pe-2 (Yellow) 45 was painted with white and black stripes on the vertical subfigures for easier photo tracking. All amount was deleted from the test aircraft.

A full-size manilla was used for the first ejection trials. These tests were initially failures, due to the seal contacting the Pe-2 during ejection. This subroutine was soon corrected and later unmanned tests were successful. On 27 July 1947, Gavril Konradkow was successful. By ejected from the Pe-2 test aircraft. He was the first Soviet human to ext in aircraft using an election seal.

### Pe-21

The **Pe-21** (_stretheric_', Fighter) was a radical redesign of the Pe-2 bomber by the Petlyakov SRB, under the leadership of Vladimir Mysinkev. This variant was intended to correct the Pe-2's major shortcomings: its small internal bomb load of 600 K (1322.8 pounds) and its poor finding characteristics.

The new variant defined the node operator position, reducing the crew to two (pilot and navigator/pome). The wing was completely modified to reduce salting at high angles of attacking the wing was also slightly raised and modified to accommodate the end of radios of the two 1600 K line/300 K (1704.2 \(\mu\)m/gallber, timing, liquid-cooled engines, The Treglow was evaluated to hold 1000 K (224.6 \(\mu\)s pounds) of fombs inside the bomb flow. The same bomb load could also be carried centrally on the unpacking arcs. The Pe-21 had a wingmon of 17.18 at (564.6 \(\mu\)s), a wing rate of 13.4 (44.9 \(\mu\)s) guorer red), and a height of 13.4 (44 feet). The weight weight weight 7080 K (15.608.5 pounds) empty 9058 K (9.969.1 \(\mu\)s) fully loaded.

The Pe-21 was almost with two 12.78at Bersen UB machine guns, one waveform was mounted in the nose, while the other on the gun was fitted at the end of the tail cone. The navigator aimed for the full and the gun by remote control.

The Petlyakov SRB turned over the Pe-2 to the NLN VVS (Seattle and Research Institute of the Military Air Force) for state occupancies in May of 1944. The prototype reached a maximum speed of 656 kc (407.6 \(\mu\)s) at 3560 s (18.536.7 feet) and a ceiling of 11.000 at (63.082.6 \(\mu\)s). The VR-1074 comes proved to be the aircraft's weak point. The powerful had a service tilt of only 25 hours and was sufficient to maintain. These engine problems resulted in the VVS rejecting the Pe-21 for mass protection in early 1945.

### Pe-2M

The Petlyakov ORB developed the **Pe-2M** (_Modiffusioner_), Modified) as a high speed, three-set bomber. It was a radical re-design of the existing Pe-2 Series 339 aritrame. The 2C-NM was an aerodynamically cleaner aircraft than the earlier Pe-2 Series 339. Petlyakov's designer incorporated recommendations for TA/GCTI (Central and Hydrodynamics) Institute into the new engine. Two 1650 km/c V-107A engines powered the Pe-2M. The material had a wing span of 97.99 (59.6 \(\mu\)s), a length of 13.77 (44.5 feet), and a wing at 42.35 (44.8 \(\mu\)s) guorer red, it waggle 104.8 (66.42.60 \(\mu\)s) fully loaded.

The Pe-2M prototype felt the assembly that is in September of 1944. During test flights, it extended 6300 km/c V-107A and 5000 km/c V-107A (16.042.60 \(\mu\)s), which was 110 km/c V-107A (84.8 \(\mu\)s) faster than the production Pe-2 Series 339. The Pe-2M had a range of 2050 km (1273.8 \(\mu\)s), Delensive arrangement consisted of three 2000 Berns B-20 camera with 3200 grooves per gap, Queen even as much as in the note, the air energy current, and the overall mid-regions position. The widened twelve allowed the aircraft to internally carry 200 K (4409.2 \(\mu\)s) pounds of fombs - over three times the internal bomb load of the Pe-2 Series 359.

The Pe-2M performed factory test flights before was flow from the NLN VVS for state occupancies trials. The NLN VVS tests revealed many defects with the new behavior, particularly the variability of the VR-107A engines. These faults and the availability of the superior T
