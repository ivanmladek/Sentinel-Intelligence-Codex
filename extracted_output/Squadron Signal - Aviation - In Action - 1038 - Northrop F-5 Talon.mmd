Three F-SAs, seen during weapons evaluation fronts conducted by the USAF. Other F-SAs carried USAR training but were in fact one-sided by the nation whose pilots were being trained in the U.S. (the nitrogen).

T-38 "Talon"

Northrop said a better idea. Back in the mid-fifties, when most new figures were growing ever larger, more complex, and more expensive, Northrop took a long, hard look at the trend and decided to go the other way. Now, twenty years later, the lightweight fighter is in vogue, and follow-on versions of _Novar_'s brain-child are still in production. It may never become the most prolific't fighter in U.S. history (the Phantom and Sabre have wide leads in that department), but it may well set a production longevity mark before being supplanted by the F-1BL something in the eighties.

The impetus for the Northrop program was provided by the considerable market for scales to allield nations under the Military Assistance Program. Most of these nations were equipped with the F-86 or F-84 early in the fifth decade of this century. Following a 1954 tour of European and Asian nations, Northrop engineers realized that most of our alleles would not have the financial where-whittal to cope with the increasing cost of the Century Series and later fighters when their '86s and '84s began to wear out.

Northrop carried their cost studies beyond the overall program cost figure, breaking them down into three major categories, which included Research and Development, Procurement, and Maintenance and Operation. The last item on the list turned out to be the most expensive, considering the fighters that were then coming off the production lines and drawing boards of the U.S. Aerospace Industry.

Fortunately for Northrop, big and expensive was not the only thing coming off the drawing boards at General Electric, G.E. and developed a small, high thrust-to-weight ratio tropical engine to use in missiles. (No Virginia, cruise missiles are not new!) The Y-485-1 was a non-interfurning engine with 2,100 bus. of thrust, and it was available immediately. The dash line version of the 3-85, with an after-burner, promised 3,850 bus. If and weighed in a fairly 559 bus. It

Northrop's project was designated N-156F, with a tandem two seat trainer version labeled N-156F. It began as a company-funded study, as the study continued to evolve, it became apparent that the N-156F might be just what the USAF had in mind when it had issued a 1956 General Operational Requirement (GOR S-240L) for a systematic basic trainer. In November, 1955, Northrop management gave preliminary design chief W. F. Gasich the work: Get on a specific operational design to fill the bill. The T-38's gestation period had begun.

Though the fighter version was repeated to the back burner during development of the T-38, it was never completely shelved, and when the T-38 went into production, Northrop once again turned its attention to the fighter.

When the Air Force decided that it needed a supersonic basic trainer, it was because contemporary fighter aircraft had opened a giant gap between themselves and the T-33, which was the airplane students _few before going to their assigned aircraft. Too much time was being spent teaching new fighter pilots to learn to stay ahead of their new steps_. While they should have been learning weapons delivery techniques and fighter tactics, they were learning to avoid scaring themselves still with their newly acquired speed and power.

In addition to the basic requirements of supersonic capability, high rate of climb, high rate, and high altitude true airspeed navigational capability, the VSAT 38 Project Team wanted to design out some of the shortcoming of their Century Series _figures_.

Their "shopping list" included the following:

Improved audio and visual landing gear position warning system.

A more logically planned instrument layout for frR flight, with radio channel selectors placed on the panel, where a pilot making an instrument penetration could change channels without taking his eyes off the primary attitude instruments.

Cookpit controls all placed ahead of the pilot's elbow.

Improved visibility for both cockbits.

Different sizes for hydraulic disconnect fittings, to prevent cross connections of systems.

Staggered placement of flight control quick disconnects, which prevent cross connection of these systems.

Redundancy of hydraulic power systems, with either engine able to supply power in its own.

Capability to control aircraft with one alieron.

Speed brakes.

Emergency cross feed for fuel, and ability to feed all fuel to one engine.

Gravity fuel feed, as a backup to boost pumps.

Dual AC generator supplied power systems, with automatic switching to back-up if primary fails.

Redundant hydraulic systems, capable of operating on one engine.

Many of these may seem elementary now, but in the fittings they were not standard on some of the Century Series. The 738 Project Team had made a major study of aircraft accidents and their causes, and they were determined to give the students of the future a forgiving machine. (The safety record of the Talon is a test against to their judgement.) The adaptability of Northrup's basic design made incorporation of all of these requirements possible, and the first T-38 was rolled out of Northrup's 'isathborne, California works on August 15th, 1981. It made its analog flight flight on April 1969, 1978. The first two T-38 were powered by the dash one versions of the J.85, while the remaining four YTs had the more powerful dash fires installed. The thoroughings of Northrup's development program (more wind tunnel time than any previous aircraft) resulted in a smooth flight test program. More than 2,000 flights were conducted without a major accident, and the first T-38 was accepted by the Air Training Command in March, 1961.

Krown as "The White Rocket", the T-38 is a remarkable airplane in many respects. It has saved U.S. taxpayers over a billion dollars in its lifetime, (8550 million in attrition that has not occurred, as over 1,000 of the original 1,187 built are still in operation, and 8650 million in projected maintenance costs than have never materialized). In the first ten years of its production, while the rest of the U.S. economy suffered from inflation, the per unit cost of the T-38 declined every year until it was half of the original. (Some of this must be attributed to Northrup management, as the T-38%'s program manhours required to produce a bound of aircraft hardware was 20 percent better than the aerospace industry average.)

The Talon has celebrated its twentieth anniversary, with no challenger for its job on the horizon. It has trained over 4,000 pilots, and has the best safety record of any type in the inventory, (T-2.2 accidentless per 100,000 flying hours is five times less than that for Air Force fighters, and half the rate for all Air Force aircraft, it requires only 9 man-hours of maintenance for every 1 hour of flight time. (Contemporary fighter aircraft were all in the mid to upper tweeties in that category.) It has flowan over six million hours, and the USAR has never issued a twelvefuethowing operator for the T-38. It was the first supersonic aircraft in U.S. service to complete its flight test program without a major accident. The basic design of the T-38 has never been changed.

Production was at its zenith when this 1967 picture was taken at Northney's Palindale facility. Over 800 - 73-24 and been destroyed, and a follow-on-conduct for additional aircraft, to the tune of 53.5 million dollars, had just been received. (Northney)

10F-5A Fighter

The F-5 was born in a series of fits and starts. Its ancestors include a 1952 design, dubbed "Fang" (which bore a remarkable resemblance to the F-16), the "Talky Ho" fighter of 1954, which was the first of the time designed around the New General Electric lightweight turbollets, and a brief filtration with a Naval Fighter designed for operation from World War II to unitege "leep" carriers. When the Navy decided to mothball its entire feet "leep" carriers, Northrop began to concentrate on a design for the foreign market. The carrier fighter had been designated N-156, and this designation was retained. The Air Force selection of the N-156T to fulfill its requirement for a supersonic basic trainer put the program on the map to stay.

Northrop was gambling with their own money, and they decided to retain as much commands as possible between the proven T-38 and its follow-on fighter cousin. Basic differences between the two included larger engine intakes to provide for additional power, extended leading edge wing roots to decrease local thickness-cord ratio and reduce wave drag, leading-edge wing flags for increased lift and higher gross weights, and a drag parachute with its housing at the base of the rudder.

Rollout of the first F-5A, known at the time as the 1856, occurred in May 1959. Though it was essentially privatelyfunded venture, DOD allocation of 50 million to Norat and GE for engineering development resulted in use of USAR serial numbers on the prototypes, without USAF' markings (Northrop)

The pay-off to Northrop's gamble came in 1958, when the DOD decided that a lightweight fighter might be a good thing to have for its MAP customers. A letter of intent was issued authorizing Northrop to build three prototypes of the N-156F. Northrop's decision to maintain a close kinship with the T-38 enabled them to build the prototype N-156F and test fly it at Edwards AFB by the following July. The second prototype was also completed and test flyout, and the third was on the production line when the winds of change in Washington forced cancelation of the entire program.

The program linguished for two years. Then, in 1962, the Kennedy Administration's desire to "pay any price" for the maintenance of freedom resulted in its resurrection. The Department of Defense announced that it had selected the N-156F to supply to our allies under the Military Assistance Program. Northrop was asked to provide a single seat version and a two seater for training. They were designated the F-5A and B8, respectively.

The initial order for the F-5A and B8 was for 71 As and 15 Bs, but Northrop's corotance leaders half their status set on major stakes than MAP customers alone.

Northrop has long been somewhat of a market in the aerospace industry. They operate their own plants, and buy their own manufacturing equipment, while many of their competitors operate out of government-owned plants. They are not pure purveyors of death and destruction, preferring to tailor their marketing plans to a potential customer's economic and political needs. This explains why some of the first customers for the F-5 (Canada, Spain, Netherlands) got the chance to build their own F-5s, providing jobs and badly needed technological know-how to local economics. This approach has contributed to the F-5's ultimate proliferation, and it has made Northrop one of the most successful corporations in American business.

F-5C Operation "Skoshi Tiger", 1965

Though U.S. F-5 operations were on a decidedly low key until initiation of the Agressor training programs, the USAF has operated the F-5 longer than any other air force. The first F-5s to come off the production lines were delivered to the 4441st Combat Chew Training Squadron, at Williams AFB, Arizona in 1964. The 4441st was assigned the task of training aircre and maintenance personnel of the MAP recipient countries. Their first class got underway in September, 1964, and included pilots from Iran, Korea, and the U.S. Military Assistance Advisory Group (MAGA). MAGA pilots were included in the class because they would have ultimate responsibility for advising F-5 customers on how best to integrate their new flintes into existing situations.

Early class breakdown usually included at least two nationalities, though the common language was English. All classes members at fluent in the English language underwent 1.5 week language training courses prior to beginning the F-5 identification) Each MAP country sent 5 pilots, 50 enlisted people, and 2 officer maintenance specialists to Williams. The goal was to train these people as instructors, thereby establishing a training nucleus within their own country.

The F-5s used in this program all carried USAR marlies, but was in fact owned by the countries being trained. The first F-5s actually procured for the USAF went to the 4503rd F-5s, an all-volunteer group which was activated at Williams for the purpose of evaluating the F-5 in combat.

The Air Force had requested an F-5 combat evaluation, with Vietnam as the specified arena, and DOO approval for the program was granted in July, 1965. Operation "Skoshi Tiger" was underway. Training, combat modification, and modifications to the F-5s to be used in the evaluation were completed within three months, and on October 20, 1965 the 12 F-5s operated Williams AFB for South Vietnam. They were accompanied across the Pacific by KC-135 faniers, and after rest stops at Hickam and Anderson Air Force Bases, they arrived at Blen Hoa at noon the 23rd. They flew their first combat mission within five hours of arrival.

Missions flow during the combat evaluation included close support, interdiction, armed recce, ground-fire-suppressions resort of "Ranch Hand" defoliation aircraft, and counterair escort of electronic intelligence aircraft. They also flew MIG CAB missions in support of attack aircraft over North Vietnam. Unfortunately, they were never challenged by the MIGS, and the lightweight fighter had to wait another ten years to become all the rage.

A large variety of evidence was carried during the tests, but most missions were flown with 500 or 750 pound general purpose bombs. Combat loads averaged from 2,300 to 3,000 pounds, and were carried over a radius of 180 nautical miles unreuted. The missions flown over Loos or North Vietnam were staged out of Dahang, and required aerial reteting.

The design goals of Northrop's engineers were verified in the four month evaluation, as the F-5 achieved the highest operational readiness, with the lowest maintenance man hours per flight hour of any flight in the theater. (Utilization rate was 62.5 hours per month per aircraft, with the maintenance man hours per flight hour rate pegged at 11.9 during the initial phase of the evaluation, but dropping to an amazing 61.5 in the latter half of the test The rate had been predicted to be 21 hours before the tests began). The squadron claimed an engine chance record, when it accomplished an engine removal, replacement and functional flight test in one hour and fifty five minutes, under field conditions!

The F-5 endowed fastest it to its pilots, as it proved to be the least invariable combat jet in the war. In timescale controllers and the prints with its accuracy and ease of control.

During the evaluation of the F-5 five more than 3,500 series, logging over 4,000 hours of combat time, two F-5s were lost to enemy ground fire. Its outstanding performance led to Air Force study of an advanced version, which was to become the F-56 Tiger I. In F-5s used in the Skoshi Tiger program were designated "C" models because of the extensive modifications performed. They were turned over to the South Vietnamese Air Force upon completion of the evaluation.

## Canadian F-5s

The Royal Canadian Air Force announced its selection of the F-6 for its future fighter-bomber in 1965. The initial order was for 125 airplanes, to be built under License in Canada by Canada as the CF-5. The CF-5s was to be powered by the 3-85-to, and the estimated cost per airplane was 900,000 Canadian Dollars. As the program progressed, further additions to the basic design included the Fer-fit ISS gyro optical quality, two position isoswheel strut, initial refueling probe, and additional armor. Flight testing of the CF-5s board in 1966, and first deliveries were made that the following year: Initial plans called for 6CF-5 squadrons of the Canadian Mobile Command.

18 of the two best versions, designated CF-5D, were ordered for the Operational Training School at Cold Lake, Alberta. By the fall of 1967 inflationary pressures had forced reduction in the original order to 110 aircraft. Further refinements to the Canadian airplanes continued, with the addition of an aircraft hook, intake anti-icing, fotulations underlining prions, strengthened windstages, a lead-computing unpusight, a quick-change reconnaissance nose housing 3-70mm Vinet cameras, and an 8/7 percent increase in electrical generation capacity. Final production figures for the CF-5s included in 6CF-5ss and 26 CF-5s. But by the time the production program and run its course, only 54 CF-5s were in operational service, (433 Squadron at Bagotville, and 434 Operational Training Squadron at Cold Lake) the balance of Canadian Freedom Fighters being to strang at Trenton North Bay. The RCAT proposed keeping all of its two seaters, using them in lieu of 17-33% Sierra Stars in the training role, but the short range of the F-6A was unacceptable for the vast distances involved in defending Canadian Airspace, and the Canadian government began casting about for potential customers for its 'As.

By 1971 the mission of coastal waters reconnaissance had been taken over from 733-8, and contingency plans for transfer to NATO of CF-5s in an emergency was announced. The government of Venezuela approached Canada regarding the possibility of purchase of 20 of theft surplus of 5-6s the same year, and by the following year had arranged for the purchase of 18 CF-5s and 2 CF-5s. The As were supplied from surplus, and the "B8" were to be built by Canada! The funds from this sale were used to purchase an additional 18 CF-5s for Number 1 Figure Training Squadron, at Cold Lake. In 1977 the Canadian government announced that all CF-5s would be telegated to the training role upon acquisition of the NFA, or New Fighter Aircraft, as it was suphemistically called since the identity of that aircraft was not then known. Target date for that event? Sometime in the eighties.

## Dutch F-5s

The Royal Netherlands Air Force, or Koninkinklijke Nederlandse Lichtrachcht (KUL) conducted an extensive evaluation of all possible replacements for its T-33s and F-84s in 1966. They finally settled an improved version of the F-5,0 deg designated NF-5. A letter of intent to purchase 75 s and 30 s was staged on January 30, 1967. The acquisition of the F-5 was accomplished under a cooperative manufacturing agreement between Canadian in Montreal, and Fokker-Werry, and Auto Dieper facility at Ypenborg. The latter manufactured wastage assemblies, and the final assembly was done by the former.

The NF-5 is an improved version of the CF-5. Improvements included in the NF-5 rate. (Electrically-activated) coated doors to increase mass airflow for late-off. Z. A strengthened wing. 3. Manewering flags. A provision for larger external wing tanks. S. Ejector bomb rates. A strengthened and electrically heated wind-screen. 7. Doppler radiation system. A an attitude heading and reference system. 8. Emergency UHF radio. To Radar altimeter.

The first NF-5 was rolled out by Canadian on March 5, 1968. One of the first problems faced by the KUL was now to get their NF-5s from Canada to the Netherlands. Since the NF-5 is not equipped with an flight refueling, a complicated effort from program was work out. Dubbed "Hi-lite," the trans-Atlantic fly flight operation involved staging out of Goose Bay, Labrador, on to Sondereferferan, Greenland, the H&K Kieul, cleaned them to LOS LOSSTAN, in Scotland, and finally by Trenthe A.B. in the Netherlands. These flights were supported by the USAR's-2nd Aircraft Delivery Group, which provided operational briefings, and C-130 airborne navigational aircraft, which circled at pre-determined points, mid-Atlantic, to provide fires and, if needed, at-sea rescue services. The first four NF-5s, all Bmodels, and streethenthe on November 19, 1969.

The first KUL squadron of the Tackellar Air Command Command Takische Institut Attributed to reduce the NF-5 was No. 315 at Wenthe, in May 1970. Following this, No. 314 at Eindhoven, and No. 316, also at Eindhoven, traded in F-6AFs for the NF-5.

A pristine NF-5s is rolled out of the factory. The Dutch operate four lysosomes of NF-5s. They are:

## F-5E "Tiger II"

When the F-SA was designed, the Air Force was not interested in optimizing it for the air-to-air role. It was envisioned as a ground attack aircraft, with only limited air-to-air capability. There was no provision for radar or a lead-computing gunshot and, with a top speed of only Mach 1.4, it was felt that the F-SA would not be able to complete in the modern air combat area.

As newer and more powerful versions of the 485 engine were developed, and the F-SA's performance figures improved correspondingly, some people began to change their views on mission capabilities of the F-5. The new engines would not make the F-SA mach 2: airplane, but then, again accumulated as a result of air users in the Mid-East and Vietnam showed that the majority of air-to-air engages degenerated to high subsonic speeds very quickly, regardless of what the initial measured speeds were. In that regime, a lightweight fighter with good initial and sustained turning capabilities had an advantage over a larger, if more sophisticated, adversary.

When General Electric came up with the dash 21 version of the J&S, they requested the team on an _F-S_ for installation of the new new compartments. In the tail of 1986, F-5S 63448 cases were lost to Edwards AFB for modification with the new engines.

In January of 1986, the Air Force decided to fund early development costs for a follow-on version of the F-SA. It was initially designated the F-521, in deference to the new engines. The Air Force decision was based upon development of the F-5.6 into an air superiority fighter. This was to open new witsas in the F-S enhancing program, as the F-SA production line was in danger of being shut down in the early 70s.

GE successfully completed a 130 hour flight test program with the dash 21 ground-based F-S 6500F and 6500F, and began model qualification tests for following year. In the meantime, features of the F-5E were being delineated, and the following changes from the basic F-SA design emerged:

Integrated fire control radar system and lead computing gunshot. This system was designed to provide target detection and range tracking, lead computation for the twin M-39 20mm camann that were retained in the nose, i.range envelope computation for the two witing mounted M-M-9 Sidewater missions, and a roll-stabilized aiming reference for the use of guns, bombs and rockets in air-to-ground delivery.

The fuseluse was lengthened 15" and widened 16" to accommodate the larger 21 engines, which added a ninth comper stage and increased airflow from 4 pounds per second to 52 pounds per second.

Increased internal fuel capacity. This was an adod bonus of the lengthened fuseluse, and resulted in additional 570 pounds of fuel. All internal fuel in the F-SA is carried in the turge, and the new tanks were not have reticulated foam to decrease the Tiger's vulnerability to camon fire.

Increased wing area and addition of maneuvering flag system. The increased wing area totaled 16 square feet, a good portion of which was accounted for by redesigning the impact leading edge extension of the wings. The maneuvering system had been designed by Northrop for Dutch use in their NF-5s, and could be readily adapted to the F-5E.

Two position nose gear, which could raise the nose of the aircraft 3 degrees for increased angle of attack in takeoff. This feature had been developed for Canadian and Dutch F-5s and, coupled with the new engines, was expected to increase takeoff performance by 30%.

A JATO system and arresting hook, for use on short runways, both of which had been developed for Norwegian F-5s.

Even with all of the above changes, Northrop engineers estimated that the F-5E would retain 75% commonsity of tooling masters, and the Air Force estimate for spare parts commonsity and ground support equipment commonsity at 40% and 70%, respectively.

Roll out of the first F-5E was made 23, 1972, with the first flight on the following August 11th. First deliveries of production aircraft were made the following the original F-5E, which was assigned responsibility for training pilots of foreign customers.

In 1976 the 300th example of the T-38F-5 series was delivered. When asked about plans for advanced versions of the F-5 series, W. E. Gasich, now Vice President of Northrop's aircraft group, said that present and potential customers for the F-5 were well satisfied with the existing airframe/engine package, and that they would prefer to see additional developmental efforts directed towards avionics packages that could take advantage of "smart weapons." He also voiced his expectation of F-5 production through 1987.

The first F-SE, posed with the wide variety of the ordinance it is capable of carrying. (Notrop)The codepiIn June, 1973 the first ten F-GEs were delivered to the 425th TFS, at Williams AFB, Arizona. These would be used to train foreign customers and would be placed in the operational inventory once the user countries began receiving their E models later that year.

In the meantime, the Air Force had decided to initiate a program similar to the Navy's "Top Gun" dissimilar air combat training program. The Air Force's first "aggressor" squadron was the 64th Fighter Wave Spa Squadron, activated at NEIS, APR, Nevada in June, 1973. Air Air Force program went the Navy onto better, USAR's degrees use SoTaticals, and they try to think and fly like MIG drivers. Both the Navy and USAR's used the 7-38 as a Mid-21simulator unit F-58 and F8 were made available to them.

The first F-GEs to USAR Agressor squadators were 71 Tiger Its which had been ordered by DOD for supply to the VNAF in 1974. When cuts in the defense appropriations for all to 50th Vietnam were made in the first 1975 budget, 71 of the 125 Tiger Its ordered became Aggressor aircraft. The untillery dense of South Vietnam forced permanent cancellation of deliveries. The USAR eventuality formed four Aggressor Squadtions, the 64th and 65th FNF at NEIS, the 26th TFTSA at Clark AB, Philippines, and the 52th TFTAS, at RAF Alconbury, England. All are now equipped with the F-SE and U.S. Navy Fighter Wavespons School, "Top Gun" is also equipped with the F-GE and F.

A flight of CNAF F-SEs over Taiwan. These aircraft are largely manufactured by the Zero Industry Development Center in Taicchung. The F-SE is vastly superior to any of the lighter available to the Communist Chinese AI forces on the mainland, the Sherapy F-G or F-G (M-13). As a result, the mainland government has offered a reward of 770 pounds of gold to any CNAF pilot who detects to the mainland an an F-SE. This was over 82.5 million at the time the time the extra was first announced, which is the approximate cost of an F-SE. Today's office of gold would make the offer add up to over 85 million by improving the full F-G average capabilities. The National government requested is replacement for their named F-SEs, Rejecting the Allf CF-2 because of political consequences with the Anbs who stayed Taiwan with oil and possible gaps shortages, the Taiwan government requested F-G Patents, even indicating a willingness to accept surplus -5s from Taiwan components replacing them. The US State Department rejected this proposal, suggesting that the F-SE be equipped with Spitzer disaster. Understanding the speed of these so caught a geographical and the F-S performance. The Nationalities rejected the idea. Northrop estimated with a new method, the F-S. This chart related most of the structure of the F-SE, but the two F-SEs also offers new to be replaced by a single 10,000% F400 from the F-SE. The increase in Hurst would increase performance some 60% in clean condition, even with Superwinders, the F-G value lower outperformed a clean F-SE by 10%. Though the Chinese were very interested, Stic shifted this safe, claiming a policy for any exposure associated weapons to areas of potential critical control. Instead, the State Department offered Taiwan 4F-SEs equipped with the Hughes Mercury's "violated" time (certainly a sophisticated weapon, but apparently not quite as sophisticated as a single-englined F-S). At present, Taiwan plans to acquire a total of 180 F-SEs.
