## Introduction

The use of aircraft for long-range patrols of the world's oceans goes back to just before World War One. The United States' unquestioned pioneer of the 'Hydroenergune' was Glenn H. Curtiss of Hammondersport, New York, On 26 January 1991, Cutts made the first flight flight on an aircraft from winter in the Spanish Right, an area in San Diego Bayt in his way part of Naval Air Station (NAS) North Island. The United States Navy (USN) was rather slow to see the aircraft's military value, but it did see the worth of aircraft for long-range patrol and scot mains. So far 30 May 1991, CAPT Washington I. Chambers, the USN's offer to charge or location matters, ordered two hydrogen-the Cutts A-1 and A-2. Thanks were the first to aircraft purchased by the USN, and 8 May is considered the birthrate of Naval Aviation.

The German U-Bont (interwober, submarine) threat of World War One inspired the first operational use of aircraft in pursuing and destroying enemy asymmetries. Large multi-engine flying boats, including the British Patriance F.2.A, and Curtiss I-16. Five were among the first flight this class of aircraft to see action in its ride. Aircraft snats Germans sometimes on at least three occasions during World War One.

Even larger flying boats were produced following the conflict. The Curtis F-S-T and NC flying boats set numerous distance and endurance records during the immediate post-war of old. The most famous record was set by the Navy's NC-4, which made the first crossing of the Atlantic Ocean in 16-31 May 1919.

The 1920s and 1930s saw the development of ever more advanced flying boat designs, most notably the Consolidad PPV Catalina. These large twin-engine flying boats had both the range and endurance to patrol large expenses of ocean and remain short for hours at a time.

German U-Bontaj again macched all shipping during World War Two. By 1942, shipping losses were so great that the tonning of ships only by 100-busa was greater than Allied industry's ability to produce them. The submarine hunting techniques used today were first developed during these dark days in the Battle of the Atlantic.

Today, the primary aircraft sensors used to detect and track submarines are radar, acoustics, and magnetic detection. Radar is used to detect surfaces advancing or - in some cases - raised perspective of work. Accotics sources use sound radiated by a target to determine its position. A Magnetic Anomaly Detector (MAD) is used to detect large, ferrous (iron-derived) objects that may be present in the ocean.

All three of these sensors originated in either the immediate pre-war or wartime research or maturetor into a unique system during the U-Bontar wur. American aircraft used in anti-surnature operations included the Douglas in the Boosla-Botelo Lockhead P60 Hudson of P7400 Ferrano Vernaire series, Consolidad P84YLenen/Poster, and several high-busa. The latter included the P8Y Catalina, High Parkar Minister, and Consolidad P82Y Comoando.

In 1941, Lockhead been developing a large twin-engine-had-based patrol aircraft to meet the USN's future needs. Development of the aircraft was delayed until 1994, however, the Navy awarded a contract to Lockhead for two purposes and 15 service education aircraft that April. The resulting P8Y Large P8Y Japanese was the Navy's standard-based patrol aircraft between 1947 and 1962. Lockhead built 1051 Neptens, which were used with distinction to the US Navy and with several foreign nations.

The Neptune design had reached its growth limits by the mid-1950s. The P2Y-7 (later B-2P) was 40 percent heavier than the P2Y-1. Auxiliary gel engines were added to provide additional power. In 1956, the USN season began looking for an aircraft to replace the P2Y, and the following year issued a specification for the replacement aircraft.

Looked was chosen to develop the new aircraft in May 1958. The airframe design was based on Lockhead's Model L-18B **Electra** civilian transport aircraft, which first flew in December of 1957. The Electra's design - capable of carrying up to 98 passengers - most closely matched the Navy's requirement for a new maritime patrol aircraft.

This Lockhead P-2R (formerly P2R-7) Neptune (L-G-R/Bulw 140986) of P79-18 flies over the Soviet Heightor OSMSTRON on December 1962. This ship was loaded with aircraft being transported back from Cuba to the Soviet Union. The Neptune had reached the end of its development by this time and the P-3 Orion was just beginning to enter service. (PHCS Madison K. Miller)

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:9]

most important airframe change came in the form of an internal Auxiliary Power Unit (APU) installed on the aircraft's startboard side can then bomb by. This modification was made to the 134th V3-A (Bulk) [52164] and subsequent aircraft, and retrofitted to earlier P-3A3.

The Emerson ANAOA-SA Delayed Time Compression (DELT) acoustic signal processing system was first starting with the 1100 **P**-3A (Bulk) [52140]. This important upgrade allowed the aircraft to monitor 16 secondary channels for enhanced submarine tracking capability.

The P-3A's range, payload, and spacious flexible leaf itself to a wide variety of modifications in numerous operational, research, and utility roles:

**P-3A3** (Mot): This designation was applied to NaII Air Reserve P-3A3 modified during the 1980s of the National Navigation Modernization (TACNAVMOD) package similar to that installed in the P-3B (Mot).

**P-3A3** (Bulk): Several P-3A were modified for use by the US Customs Service to intercept during aircraft.

**P-3A3** (Bulk): Several P-3A were modified for use by the US Customs Service to intercept during aircraft.

**P-3A3** (Bulk): Several P-3A were modified for specialized maintenance techniques and research by two portal squadros. They were replaced by similarly configured -P-3BJs during the mid-1970s.

**P-3A** (Bulk): **P** (Bulk): **P**-3A were modified with Electronic Intelligence (ELINT) systems, chaffel designers, Sledge-Locking Airborne Radar (SLAR), exhaust shoots, and AIA-96 Sideward Air-to-Air Missiles (CAMs). The Central Intelligence Agency (ICA) used two aircraft, which were then proven by the Republic of China Air Force (ROCAF) on overfils of China, Burna, and Tibet for free-type aerial. These two were later modified into **EP-3B Bat Rack** aircraft and the JA-robai (Foster/SPIN) became an EP-3A.

**CP-3A** (The P-3A was a proposed corps and transport version modified with a large cargo door, with its aircraft never materialized.

**EP-3A** (This designation was applied to a former P-3A Project STPSPIN aircraft used for ELINT systems development. A former P-3A modified for electronic research and also used the designation, along with WP-3A was used as electronic aggressive migration aircraft and seven Olfots used in range control and telemetry roles. The latter P-3A was later designated RP-3A3.

**NP-3A** Designated for P-3A and in electronic research roles; later designated EP-3A and subsequently RP-3A. The designation applied to the VP-3A while with NASA as a research aircraft until its retirement.

**RP-3A** (Designation given to P-3A3 modified for oceanographic research by Oceanographic Development Squadron Eight (CWN-8) at NAS Pat Patuent River. These included RSPESACan that gathered information on ocean patterns and other sea conditions) and Project BIROSEYE (which monitored Arctic to partners). One EP-3A and one NP-3A were modified for electronic work-by-as also used a later designation for range control and telemetry EP-3A3. Many were subsequently designed RP-3A.

**TP-3A**: The designation TP-3A was given to 12 P-3A confirmed as pilot trainers, with P-3C Update I focus installed and mission systems removed. The East and West Coast Fleet Readlines Speadstrom, VP-3A to NAS JACKsonike and VP-3A at NAS Moffel Field, were the primary TP-3A-perators. Some fleet boards temporarily per-3A was when operational aircraft were going through extensive maintenance.

**RP-3A** (P-3A) was on EP-3A with mission systems removed and passenger seats installed, with space reserved for light cargo. No two were identical; at least one had a'semi-YUP' (Very Important Person) interior configuration. Some were redesignated RP-3D.

**VP-3A**: Three WP-3A and two P-3A profiles as executive transports with command-level communications and push interior conditions for the office of Naval Operations, Commanders in Chief of the US Atlantic and Pacific Peets, and Commander US Naval Forces Europe. One served for several years with a Marine crew as transport for the Commanders of the Marine Corps.

**WP-3A**: Four WP-3A were modified as hurricane hometes for Weather Commissioner Squadron Four (W-4), replacing Lockheed WC-121N Warning Stars in the same role. Three WP-3As later became VP-3A and one became an NP-3A.

This VP-3A (Buildo 149676) assigned to VP-30 at NAS Jacksonville is used to transport the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO). The VP-3A has an executive interior and heat the MAD boom removed from its tail. A glossy insignia Blue (F515044) chematline separates the glossy insignia White upper surfaces from the glossy Light Gray (F516440) undersurfaces. (Vila PiPCSAthon K. Miller)

The PP-3A (Buildo 150495) Valyvia is parked at Naval Air Facility (NAF) Washington - the Naval side of Andrews AFB, Maryland - on - 7 July 1998. In began life as a standard P-3A and was retired from duty as the station nearest for NAS Kelvin, Iceland in January of 2004. (Dr. J.G. Handelman via PiPCSAthon K. Miller)

Eight cloud seeding dispensers are mounted on stations 12-15 of this P-3A. The Naval Orthinance Test Station (POTS) at NAS China Lake, California developed these dispensers under Project STOMRU/PURY, which runs from 1962 AN1982. They discharged 'rounds' of crystallizer iodide into storm clouds. STOMRU/PURY's hypothesis was to seed the first rain band outside the wall of clouds around the hurricane eye. (MIC) An overall glossy Black Jet (FFTS) P-3A (STSPrain) takes of from a Rayfusion facility. Rayfusion modified these Orions for the Central Intelligence Agency (CJA), which operates them from Taiwan with the Republic of China AI Force (DOCAI) on overlifts of China in the mid-1860s. These P-3As had air scoops on each side of the forward fuselage for air sampling and leaflet dispenses in the bomb by doors. Wing-mounted rails for air sampling Alto-9 Sidewinder missites were also installed, along with clipped properlers. Additional STOMRU/PURY dispensers were mounted on the P-3A's outer wing panels. The pods were attached to zero 56A-1 bomb tracks on the prongs. Three dispensers were mounted on each actor wing, plug eight under the fuselage, for a total of 14 dispenses, a STOMRU/PURY P-3A seeded Hurricane Bealth over the North Atlantic on 23 August 1963; however, this storm did not grow after seeding. (MIC) extended engine exhaust shoots, and a dorsal astrocome in the rear fuselage. Additionally, the P-3A had a truncated tail boom with a calf disperser, a ventral thinhte and a cargo door. These aircraft flow missions over China, Burning, Tibet, Laos, and Vietnam. Two were modified as EP-3B Bat Rick aircraft in 1966. (Rayfusion via Rick Burges)

Projects Patrol Spaudrons One and Two (VPU-1 and VPU-2).

EP-38: Not to be confused with the top F-3B and 3Bat Racks modified from \({}^{1}\)-SAs, one P-3B (153442) was modified for research roles with the Naval Research Laboratory (NRI); at NAS Patrol River, Maryland. It featured hard points on the bomb by doors for electronic equipment pads. This EP-3B was initially used to test electronic warflem equipment, but was later modified with a Lockheed Martin AN/APS-145 randomer for testing the Cooperative Engagement Capability and the E-2C Hawkeye 2000 mission systems. The EP-3B was subsequently redesigned NP-3D.

**EP-31:** Two F-3B were modified into EP-3B for service as electronic front simulators for fleet services. The aircraft were fitted with immining systems, including radar immerses, chaffs, and the Rockwell Collins Users SANADS/103 communications jammer. The new EP-3B served sequentially with VAO-33, VPU-6 and finally VQ-11.

**NP-3B:** A single P-3B was modified during the mid-1970s for service with a secret unit for classified research or operations. The aircraft featured a came the extended method of the length of the underside of the breakage. The aircraft's MADD bond has been removed. This NP-3B served until 2001.

**UP-3B:** Five P-3B were stripped of most mission systems and fitted with passenger seats for utility transport roles. One was later modified to an RP-3D for oceanographic research with VNA-8.

**NP-3B:** The EP-3B-fitted with an AN/APS-145 roadome and assigned to the NRI, and two RR-3D - including the former VP-3C - were redisculated NP-3D for permanent research roles.

**RP-3D:** One P-3B, one VP-3C, and the P-3B assigned for research and oceanographic survey notes were redisculated NP-3D. Two RP-3D were later redisculated NP-3D.

Electric AN/ANXR-13 Low-Light-Level Television (LLLTV) system, which was inadequate and removed from use by the mid-1970s. The KA-74A camera below the aircraft's nose became a distinguishing feature of the new aircraft.

The P-3C-vas has first to introduce the AN/ADA/7-(y)Directional Frequency Analysis and Ranging (DIFAR) acoustic sensor system, which was able - through the AN/ARR-72 technology receiver - to monitor 160 snownowsky simultaneously. It has developed directional bearings from DIFAR soundboxy and range from active-pinghong snowdys. The ANA/A72-type of the P-3C-A decided advantage in tracking is main energy, Soviet submarines, was also extracted on the new AN/ADA-4 piece record. The new aircraft also featured a large battery of 48 externally-loaded snownowy launch tubes, versus nine on entire Oriros. Three additional internally-loaded snownowy tubes are mounted in the at firstheage.

P-3C also featured a wide range of communication equipment. These included Ultra High Frequency (UHF), VRH Frequency (VHF), and High Frequency (HF) radios, computer-interfectleyed ice, and the AN/ADA-5 data link for exchange of computer data with the Lockheed S-3 Viking, Grunmann E-2C Hawkey, and command-and-control stations above and on ship.

The P-3C was armed similarly as carrier status, with 12.75-inch (3248no) Mk-64 tropecoles, and 857 nuclear depth bombs, AGN-12 Ballupp ASMs, and a variety of reckels, bombs, and 160.

Lockheed delivered the first 69 3 baseline P-3C (Busk 156057) in 1996, Portugal Squadron Fifty Six (NP-56) at NAS Jacksonville, Florida was the first separator to be equipped with the new version, but V-94 was the first to deploy with the P-3C, to Naval Station (NS) Kelfkkkk, Leiford in 1970.

While P-3C production was underway, a series of five updates was planned for the US Navy's P-3C Heet to keep it current with emerging technology.

P-3C Update I Orion

The improvements included in the **Update I** program included adding a drum-memory logic unit to the Spery AN/AS-10-14 general purpose digital computer, which expanded memory to 48 s and allowed installation of a LAN/ASA-66 technical display to the acoustic operator's radio. The computer-controlled Northview AN/ARR-99 Omega replaced the AN/ARN-16 LOAN test.

Update I Orions also featured the AN/AQ-7-(y)+, an upgrade to the acoustic sensor that featured higher sensitivity. This system was installed on the last 18 Update Is, but was retrofitted in the final 162 release I.

The Update I development aircraft (Busk 15828) was followed by 30 P-3C Update Is, which were initially delivered to P-3/1-y, P-3/1-y, P-3/1-y, and V-94-y, P-3/1-y took the Update I on its first deployment, to NAS Adda, Alaska, in 1976. Most Update Is received some Update II systems and some were later modified to other configurations.

## Appendix P-3C Update II Orion

The **Update II** represented a significant increase in the P-3C's combat capability. The Texas Instruments AN/ASA-36 Infrared Detection Set (IRDS) turned replaced the KA-74 camera in the nose. The hierarchal also featured the Cubic AN/ARS-3 Snowboy Reference System and the 28-rack Precision Instruments AN/ADt-(4-y2 use receiver. The Update II's main improvement was adding the AGM-84 Harogon ASM, which gave the P-3C a credible anti-ship capability. The IRDS, AN/ADt-(4-y2), and Harpoon were retrofitted to P-3C Update Is.

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:19]

P-3C Update III Oriom

The P-3C Update III was intended to be an upgrade on the way to the Update IV configuration. The US Navy cancelled Update IV in 1994, which left Update III as the common upgrade configuration for all earlier P-3C-like (Table III program was never adequately made). This allowed progress and resulted in many P-3C-source receivering the planned upgrade.

Update III was an automatic upgrade with some structural modification to accommodate is new acoustic screen suite, and the NAV/ISO-15 prototype. It was distinguished by its Cathode Ray Tube (CRT) acoustic displays and the large-black AN/ARAR-78 Advanced Sonodyne Communications Link (ASCI) High Energy (MMSP) sensors under the mid-rise-long-lag. The aircraft is capable of monitoring or recording up to 32 channels, but could select among the 99 channels of snow snowhaw sensitive available. It also included in upgraded sensors-error system, the AN/ARS-5.

Another major improvement incorporated in Update III is the Lockhead Marital AN/ASQ-212 digital central computer, which is replaced the AN/ASQ-114. Many Update III retrofit aircraft had the Litoma AN/ASQ-6031 ASM system installed, with embedded wingband using an-task induced removal of the AN/ASQ-78 post.

One P-3C (Bulab 158989) served as the Update III Improve and Bunko 161410 was modified on the production line at the first Update III. The US Navy received 37 independent Update IIIs and replotted more than 100 other P-3C-s to the Update III configuration (underlifeally designated P-3C Update IIIs), although not all systems were replaced with identical controls. The 40 was the first Detect squadron to operate the Update III, acquiring the interest in 1995. A single US Navy P-3C-s Odency adjusted with Update III versions by the mid-1996, although many older versions were used for training during data reuse cycles.

For Postdocation Update IIIs were delivered in the Royal Norwegian Air Force in 1999 to replace P-3C (Bulab 158989) in 333 Skadvent (S Squadron) at Andoya, Norway. Kawasaki built 30 Update IIIs for the JMSD/.

P-3C Update III+ Orion

**Update III+** was the designation applied to the eight P-3Cs acquired by the Republic of (South Korea Navy, They are equipped with the Raybuch AN/ARS-134 dark and the Lockhead Marin As/Q-212 acoustic processor. These were the last Protons built by Lockhead. The first aircraft were delivered to South Korea in 1995-96 to replace Gumman S-2 Trackers. Kawasaki also built two Update III aircraft for the JMSD/.

## Additional Modifications

Many P-3C received many other modifications - especially during the 1998b and 1999s - that were applied to some aircraft, but not universally. These included survivability enhancements like the Marconi AN/AE-47 chair and that they generate, the Hercules AN/ARAR-78 mis-like warning system (with AN/ALQ-157 infrared jammer), self-sealing fuel tanks, and laser protection.

Begining in the 1997b, several fleet P-3Cs have served as Project BEARTRAP aircraft, equipped with an additional sensor core station. These aircraft were used to further develop ASW effectiveness.

[FIGURE:SA VP-30 P-3C passes by the crowd with Its bomb bay doors open during the US Air and Trade Show of Dayton International Airport, Ohio in July 2003.

(0.8) bay by PRZ Damon 3. Moritz) During the mid-1990s, a few P-3C- received the Rayton AN/AFS-137 Increase Synthetic Aperture Radar (ISAR) in place of the AN/AFS-15, ISAR can identify moving targets with high resolution images. The AN/AFS-137 allowed the aircraft to receive images of the target that permitted the crew to identify the vessel type. A P-3C equipped with the UTLAW HUNTER over-the-horizon targeting use was successfully deployed during the 19PI Persian Gulf War. Subsequently, four P-3Cs were modified with AN/AFS-137 and the Global Positioning System (GPS). These aircraft became the three successive generations of the Over-the-Horizon Airborne Sensor Information (OSTAS) system. OSSA 15, II, and IIIL OLASS III later became the basis of the Anti-surface Warrate Improvement Program (APAP).

These modifications featured prominently in the 1991 Persian Gulf War, during which variations P-3Cs versions served with great effectiveness in targeting and surveillance roles. Although the Orion launched by neurons during the war, they provided targeting to Navy carrier-based strike aircraft that hit a PA-3C Update in **(Retro-46)** assigned to **V9-46** files instead used what is believed to be one of the Cascade Mountains. In 1994, Moffett Field-based VP-46 became the first Pacific Fleet squadron to equip with Orion's Station towards transitioned to the P-3C in January of 1977. The subdued TPS of this P-3C has since given way to overall glossy Light Gray, with high-visibility national insights. #46 moved from Moffett Field to NAS Vmbiloy Island, Washington in late 1993. (PHCS Mahlon K. Miller)P-3C BMUP

Funding shortfalls slowed the Update III retrofit program, which resulted in many Update III various components becoming obsolete or going out of production. The Block Modification Upgrade Program (BMUP) began to convert Update L5s to a configuration compatible with the Update III in 1996. The crew stations appeared to be Update III stations, but with state-of-the-art auctions systems behind the panels.

Lockeded Martin delivered 28 BUUP kits to the Navy; ten BMUP aircraft had been modified by July of 2003 and 15 more conversions were planned.

## Appendix P-3C AIP

Cipitalizing on the success in the Balkams, the Anti-surface Warfire Improvement Program (AIF) - later, the Aircraft Improvement Program - became a major P-3C upgrade program and the most potent to date. The AIP gave the Orion a highly complete optical surveillance and at - for the first time - a substantial land-attack capability in the form of the Boeing AGM-84S Sandford Land-Attack Missule (SLAM). This weapon has a 488-pound (221 Ko) warhead and a range of 50 national miles (SS III)380.

Three generations of P-3C Alps have been introduced. AIP I, as in the Counter-Drug Upgrade (CDU) version, the LNA/AVA-1-CUSTERANCE RESORES installed at the Tactical Coordinator's station. The LNA/AVA-137BV(s) - which has both Synthetic A Radar (SAR) and Insure Synthetic A Radar (SAR) are illustrated. SAR is a configuration stationary targets with high-resolution images. The ESM system was upgraded with the EP-2600 pulse analyzer and ANAL/ACL/SC-(5C). The latter ten features a distinct time-of-the-night dome within P-3C US injection finding (DE) antenna under the heritage at the wing trailing edge. The OASIS III system was incorporated, as was an upgrade to the ANNASA-36 IRDS. The ANA/AVA-47 anti disperser and the LNA/AVA-47 anti-smiling system were also standard with AIP 1 Improved color coded dialysis were provided at a cross-sections. The ANA/AVA-22-mission controler LUTs-92 inertial navigation system, ANA/AVA-151 Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver, and Satellite Operations (SATCOM) capability became standard. The P-3C AIP I became operational with VP-9 at NAS Moffett Field in April of 1998.

The second-generation AIP - AIP II - became operational in September of 1999. AIP II incorporated the Wescam Advanced Imaging Multispectral System (AIMS), which took the IRDS under-one position and replaced the AN/AVA-1. AIP III incorporated the Early Limited Control Identification (ECLID) system and became operational in September of 2000. The US Navy originally planned to acquire 146 AP kits. The NY approved 63-C3 IA updated by mid-2004, with another nine Orion scheduled for this upgrade.

The P-3C AP demonstrated its worth during Operation ALLFDORES in the Balkams in early 1999. The aircraft launched 14 SLAMs against Serbian targets and was considered the most responsive surface platform in theater. The P-3C AP went on further acclimion October of 2001, launching SLAMs against Platinum and A-beta targets inside Afghanistan. The P-3C AIP's electro-optical sensors and data-link capability became particularly effective as a surveillance platform supporting ground forces in Operation ENDURTO RESEDOM. In March and April of 2003, P-3C AirWS were praised for the similar support provided to Marines on the ground in India during Operation RAIDF REEDOM.

The improved ASM-84H Sandford Land Attack Missule - Expanded Response (SLAM-ER) has replaced the AGM-84S SLAM at the P-3C AIP's main land-attack armment. The SLAM-ER has a 800-pound (363 Ko) overhead and a range of 150 national miles (173 miles/278 Ko).

## Appendix A Appendix

### ANALE-7

The _Aircraft_ Improvement Program (API) - formerly the _Anti-Surface_ Surface Improvement Program - is the most recent update to the US Navy's F-3 fleet. The most recognizable differences with this upgrade are the SATCOM "Building" antennas and the ANNALE-66 Electronic Support Measures (ESAT) random on the centerline, just forward of the nonobucy chutes. An AGA-68 Market ASII is mounted under the port owing. (US Navy) The B-C-API upgrade incorporates several survivability enhancements that include these ANNALE-47 Interwalt alignments located on the Number 2 and 3 engine maeeties, each fire-ing outdoor. Each flare bucket blocks 46 s after indoor frame rounds, which decoy radar-homing and heat-seeking missiles, respectively. At the benchmark removes the landing gear safety bins prior to launch. Main gear fires are 40 inches (101.6 cu) by 14 inches (35.6 c), (US Navy)P-3C Cup

Tcn of the 13 Royal Netherlands Navy (BNLN) P-3C Update ILSs are being modified to the p-3C Capabilities Upgrade Program (CUP) configuration. This is similar to the AIP and includes the AN/ADS2-27 mission computer, AN/ADS-137BV5 radar, AN/ADS-78B acoustic processor, AN/ALR-66CV(3) SBS system, and S/ATCOM. The first P-3C Cup was delivered to the RNLN in late 2003. The three remaining Dutch Orions received a more limited upgrade.

## Appendix P-3C Uip

The four RNoAFP 3C Update IIIs received the Update Improvement Program (UIP) modification - similar to AIP - between 1997 and 2000. Equipment includes the AN/ADS-212 central computer, AN/ADS-137BV5 radar, AN/ALR-66CV(3) SBS system, GPS, and SATCOM.

### P-3C Derivatives

**P-3C [87]**: Four P-3Cs have been modified as covert multi-sensor reconnaissance and research aircraft for Special Projects Patrol Spadurds One and Two (VPU-1 and VPU-2), replacing four P-3Bs that had long served in that role.

**AP-3C:** This design applies to 18 Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) P-3C Update II and ILS aircraft modified under the Sea Sentinel program. These have updated navigation (including GPS), SATCOM, the DDC-000 mission computer, SEN/ALR-2022A(3) radar, and the AN/AVTS-503 acoustic system. Raytheon delivered the first modification in 1999, then Boing Australia converter in the remainder 17 aircraft.

**NO-3C:** Although US Navy P-3C have served as RDTAE aircraft for test establishments, only one was redesignated as an NP-3C.

**OP-3C:** The Japanese Maritime Self-Deference (JMSDF) is expected to modify six JMSP P-3C to QO-1 originally (VPU-3E) multi-sensor reconnaissance aircraft, similar to the US Navy's special projects P-3C.

**UP-3C:** Designation given to a JMSP aircraft built a radar calibration and test aircraft.

**RP-3D:** One aircraft on the P-3C production line was delivered to the US Navy as an RP-3D oceanographic survey aircraft for Project MASNET with by Oceanographic Development Squadron Eight (VNN-8). It later served with the Naval Research Laboratory and Y-3C above before being retired in 2003. The aircraft was equipped with environmental sensors and a non-reforms appearing (all section) to allow the crew to accurately measure variations in the Earth's magnetic field. Later, the XP-3C was modified to the RP-3D for oceanographic survey. Both aircraft subsequently were redesignated NP-3Ds.

**NP-3D:** See RP-3D above.

**UP-3D:** Designation given to three aircraft built by Kawasaki for the JMSDF as electronic threat simulators for fleet training. The third P-3D computed was the last Orion built.

**WP-3D:** Two aircraft based on the P-3C but modified with a random place in place of the bomb bay and a sensor boom in place of the MAD boom, were delivered to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). They are employed for atmospheric research, including hurricane reconnaissance. These aircraft carry various sensor and navigation systems for research missions.

**EP-3D:** Given no suffix to its designation, the JMSDF's five Kawasaki-built EP-3S were in the electronic reconnaissance role, similar to that of US Navy P-3Cs.

**EP-3E:** Twelve P-3Cs were converted to RP-3E:** Ates ILs electronic reconnaissance aircraft during the early 1990s to replace two EP-3Bs and ten **EP-3E Arries I** in service with Fleet Air Recomnaissance Squadrons (VQs) 1 and 2.

**P.-3W.** Internal designation used by the RAAF for its Update II.5 aircraft to distinguish them from its Update Its.

**Life Extensions**

The current P-3C fleet has been required to serve long beyond expectations. This has resulted in many Orions exceeding or apecoaching the end of their service lives. Several stop-gap programs were instituted in the late 1990s to combat corrosion and extend the fleet's life, but the aircraft's degraded condition and the flight hours required by combat operations in the last decade have exhausted many P-3Cs. The US Navy began to retire up to 80 P-3Cs beginning in December of (2003) and is planning to operate a fleet of 150 Orions until the Multimission Maritime Aircraft (MMA) comes on line in the early 21st Century.

## Cancelled Programs

Numerous advanced versions based on the P-3C were planned or proposed, but never reached production. These include the P-3C Update IV, P-3G, P-3H, P-7A, Orion 2000, P-3 Procyon, and Valyrie.

### Orion 21

Leckhed Martin proposed an improvement of the Orion 2000 by rebuilding P-3Cs with numerous apecoaches. This was proposed for the US Navy's MMA program to replace the current P-3C fleet. Lockheed Martin later changed this from rebuilding existing P-3Cs to building new aircraft. Being offered \(\mathrm{\SIUnitSymbolFace{37}}\)-300 after derivative to fill this requirement. On 14 June 20th, the Navy expected Boeing's MMA proposal and awarded a contract for seven test aircraft. The Navy plans to purchase up to 109 Boeing MMAs to replace the P-3Cs currently in service.

## EP-3B/E Electronic Reconnaissance

The Orion's flexibility made it a natural choice for modification. The most significant of these modifications was the EP-3- an astericabilizing in Electronic Intelligence (EJINT) activities. The EP-3-A full story may never be fully disclosed, but the aircraft has played an important role in national defense and security issues since its introduction during the late 1960s.

The Navy plans to replace the EP-3E with the Aerial Common Sensor program, a large business jet aircraft extensively modified with an EJINT suite.

## EP-3B Bat Rack

During the Vietnam War, the US Navy's two Fect Air Reconnaissance Spathons - VQ-1 at NAS Again, Gama and VQ-2 at NAS Beta, Spain - flew the EC-121M Warning Star derived from the Lockheed-1-1049 Constellation antitumor. Two of the three highly modified P-A (STPSPIN) aircraft (BusBus 149678 and 1496967) flowny the USA and the ROCAF were returned to the Navy in 1969 and modified in the PP-3B Bat Rack electronic surveillance aircraft. The third 3-A (STPSPIN) (Rube 149673) was modified to an EP-3A, which was initially used for concept development of the electronic surveillance equipment installed onboard the two EP-3B8.

The EP-3A and EP-3B8 are equipped with the distinctive ventral 'MAM' refractive tandem place in the bomb. This random - whose shape resembles the MMM chocolate candy - housed- on the 339 rotating antenna (modified ANANANA-120) for the ANA/LC-101 BIG LOOK radar analysis system. EP-3B8 were equipped with antenna array processed by dorsal and ventral 'cases'. The chairs were extensively modified with extra stations on both sides, and up to 33 crewmenmen's were often carried. The P-A's nose and tail raform were replaced by power transformers to convert the aircraft's 400 Hertz electrical power (0 to 0 feet) barrier required by many of the electronic sensors in the bath at approximately 100 Hz and used to identify new deceleration to be high- or above-band. The MMM boom was deleted, giving the aircraft a distinctive 'botil'. The MMM boom was deleted, givingness were replaced by 4600 step T56-A1-4s common to be "3B". The flight, in the EP-3B8 used the extended engine successfully through the P-3A (STPSPIN).

The EP-3B8 Bat Racks were equipped with sensors to intercept and analyze radar emissions (Electronic Intelligence, or EJINT) and to interpret and analyze enemy communications (Communications Intelligence, or COMIM). They were assigned to VQ-1 and staged to Dang. Vietnam, where they were kept busy locating and analyzing North Vietnamese at and providing warning of Surface-to-Air-Missit (SAM) Iunches.

The EP-3B8 were highly successful and the Navy proceeded with the improved EP-3B. The EP-3B8 were improved and eventually brought up to EP-3B standard but retained their EP-3B designation. They were used extensively in cold War peripheral recominations and were retired in the late 1980s, eventually replaced by the EP-3B **Aries II**.

## EP-3E ArIES I

The EP-3B8' success led the Navy to convert ten P-3A8 to the EP-3E **Airborne Reconnaissance Integrated Electronics System (Arles)** configuration. These

## JMSDF EP-3

The Japanese Maritime Self-Defense Force (JMSDF) flies five EP-3s in electronic roles similar to those flown by US Navy EP-3Es. The antenna configuration of the JMSDF aircraft is different than US aircraft and will be covered separately in the chapter on Japanese aircraft.

This smart leads the distinctive Magnetic Anomaly Detector (MAD) tail boom that typifies P-3 Orion Antl-Submarine Warfare (ASW) aircraft. (Dob)NASA P-3s

The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) became the first US Federal Government agency to operate the P-3 when it obtained the YY37-1 (Buhts 148276) from the Navy in 1966. It was assigned the civil registration NA28NA. This aircraft was originally built as an L-188 Eleters, then modified to become the P3Y prototype. The modification included a redesigned one section that was eight effect (2.4) shorter than the Eleters and a modified tail to house the MAD equipment. Following its naval service, the aircraft was stripped of his Navy electronics and turned to NASA, which modified it with modular electronic tracks. The aircraft was originally based at Elsition Field near Houston's Johnson Space Center, where it participated in numerous remote sensing projects as part of NASA's Earth Resources Program.

In 1977, NA28NA was relocated to NASA's Walogs Island, Virginia facilities, where it continued its action collection dates. Its useful service life complete, it was donated to the National Museum of Naval Aviation, where it resides to this day.

NA28NA is a hybrid aircraft. Originally starting its as an L-188, it was modified as the P3Y-1 aerodynamic prototype. Later in this case, it was not to airfaster standards, additionally, the aircraft was given wing from an L-188 after corrosion was discovered in original y-188 in original y-188, but this is unique modifications, this aircraft was redesigned as a **NP-3A**.

NASA's second Orion (US civil registration NA28NA) was originally a Navy P-3B (BuhS 152735). As with 148276, this aircraft was configured for remote sensing and other earth resources experiments. It has also been given an Electronic Flight Instrumentation System (EFIS) and other advanced cockpit bypass. These included the Global Positioning System (GPS), Satellite Communications (SATCOM), and an Enhanced Ground Proximity Warping System (EGPVS). This aircraft is currently based at Walogs Island.

A second P-3B (BuhN 153429) was transferred from the Navy to NASA. Following cuts in NASA's budget, this aircraft was subsequently cannibalized to keep N428NA flying.

## NOAA WP-3D

The United States Department of Commerce's National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) operates two highly modified Orion's designated WP-3D. Their primary mission is weather research and surveillance. Secondary missions include remote sensing, environmental studies and oceanographic research. The WP-3Ds are outlined with a C-Band radar housed in a retractable dome in the bench base was similar to the EP-3 installation. Additionally, a French-manufactured X-Band radar is housed in a highly modified tail'stinger'. Other modifications include several additional observation windows on each fuse, size and a distinctive early-stird air ('spair' probe mounted on the forward fuse-lage's standard side. The cabin intercepts are also highly modified and can be reconformed for specific missions using modular electronics recks.

The NOAA WP-3Ds are also unique in the fact that they were the first Orion with chinks rated to fly over 3-000 feet (914) day. After 78-32 hours during 25.30 feet (8626.36).

Two aircraft - N42RF (UN Busho, 195773) and N43RF (Buno, 19578) were delivered to NOAA in 1975 and 1976. They were originally based in Miami, Florida, but operations shifted to Magelli AFB in Tamag, Florida in 1993.

The WP-3Ds are best known in their 'Hirt' Hurricane' probe, but they have been employed in other works. These include ozone monitoring, storm cell tracking and data gathering in the Midwest and other regions, fisheries monitoring for the National Marine Fisheries Service, and on-m rate occasion - law enforcement.

Data gathered during these flights is passed to the National Hurricane Center in Miami or another controlling agency using the WP-3D's Aircraft Satellite Data Link (ASDL). This allows ground-based personnel to monitor the aircraft's sensors in real-time.

**Fran**: The Imperial Iranian Air Force ordered six P-3P Options in 1973. Based on the P-3C, these aircraft carried a mix of P-3A, B-3, and Cavionics; however, the XSW mission systems were closely resembled that of the earlier variants. This was due to export and technology transfer concerns. Following the Iranian Revolution in 1979, the Islamic Republic of Iran Air Force continued to 10 fly diminishing numbers of the six P-3P, as sparse support was terminating.

And year, some P-3P charger for more information.

Japan: Japan is the P-3P charger of more information.

Japan: Japan is the largest P-3P operator after the US Navy, with 110 Orions purchased for the Japanese Martinez Setlen Defense Force (MSDF). See the chapter on the Kawasaki Heavy Industries P-3C.

**Norway**: Norway required a maritime patrol aircraft with substantial range to cover the country's over 2500 miles (3380 s/n00 of mainland coastline and another 18,000 miles (28,907) road) of the island coastline. This was coupled with the country's proximity to the Soviet Union (now Russia). The Royal Norwegian Air Force (RNSA) selected the P-3B traveling in 1968 to make their Grumont UF Address amphishers. Five P-3B were delivered in 1996 and allocated to No. 3333 February (S Squadron) at _Atro Brasymo_(Air Station). These aircraft were at the front line of defense against the Soviet Union's Northern Fleet. The most dramatic incident involving a Norwegian Orion occurred in 1987, when a P-3B (602).

These aircraft fitted with P-3C to rectify and take to carry 380 real passengers - were redesignated P-3B, both P-3B are used for coastal transport, and transporting, Kenya Norway showed five P-3C update III with full ASW mission systems in 1989. Recently, these aircraft have received the IProgate Improvement Program (UP) modifications similar to those on US Navy P-3B, including the AN/AAR-47 infrared thermal turbine system and SATCOM capability.

The Netherlands: The Dutch _Murchine_ Laboratory (MDL, Naval Air Service) ordered the P-3CPakistan: Pakistan is the sole p-3C Update II.75 operator. This variant is a hybrid between the capabilities of the Update II.5 and the Update III aircraft. Three P-3Cs were ordered in 1988, but there were not delivered until 1997 due to an arms embryonic.7 The Pakistan Naval Aviation's P-3Cs are assigned to No 2S Squadron of Feisal and patrol Pakistan's Exclusive Economic Zone (DEZ). One Orion was destroyed in a crash in 1999.

Portagion: The Forcaro Afteron Forengues (Portagion: Air Force) ordered six ex-RAAF P-3B Lightweight/TAX/ONATOO P-3B from Lockwell in 1985. These aircraft received a modelization package and various gridowed and described in "P.2P." They were delivered in the standard US Navy Water under Light Group when scheme; however, the P-3N layer received the unsonal "Oroat" Palm scheme of those of Gray. The P-3P's primary recognition feature is an ANALYSIS-66(3) advance met the art feasible. They are operated by 601 Xeonay (S Squadron) at Monty and have participated in operations over the former Yugoslavia.

South Korea: South Korea is the sole p-3C Update III- operator. They have the distinction of operating the last American-manufactured Orions and the Orions' P-3s built at Lockwell Laboratory Martin's Marticon, Georgia plant. The South Korean government ordered with P-3Cs in December of 1990, with the first being delivered in April of 1995, No 163 ASW Sparton at Pohan flies flies Ottions. South Korea requires eight more P-3s, but at this writing, the South Korea government has not placed additional orders.

## CP-140 Aurora/Arcturus

The Canadian Armed Forces (CAF) began seeking a replacement for the Canadian CF-107 Arges in the early 1970s. After considering a number of airframes including the Boeing 707, the Canadian government selected the P-3 Orion in November of 1975 as the basis for its new maritime patrol aircraft. A contract for 18 Orion was signed in July of 1976.

The CAF has its own military aircraft design system for military aircraft, aircraft which the Canadian aircraft system was given the designation CP-140. In 1977, the aircraft received the Aurora. The first of 18 CP-140s left Locklocked 5 Burshana, California factory in January of 1979 and floor for the first time two months later, on 22 March 1979.

All 18 Norms were delivered to Canada by March of 1981, the CP-140s initially equipped three solutions of Canadian Forces Base (CFB) Greenwood, Nova Scotia, No. 404 Squadron was designated as the Marting and Planto Training System, while No 405 and 415 squadations were operational squadations. All three of the Greenwood squaders fell under the administrative control of 1499. Also based at Greenwood, In 1981, a fourth CP-140 squadron was activated at CFB Comes, British Columbia. This unit was No 407 Squadron, which came under the administrative control of 19 Wing. Serial numbers assigned to the CP-140 fleet are 14010 to 14018.

The CP-140 is externally similar to the P-3, has much different mission equipment than American P-3, This equipment included the AN/APS-506 surface sensor radar, AN/AQ-502 process, AN/AQ-502. Magnetic Anomaly Detector (MAD), and a unique Electronic Power (ESSM) sensor mounted in the aircraft's wings. The CP-140s acoustic suite is often referred to as two 5-N3 Vilias; because it is similarly to the Viking site. The 5-D40 has 36 somboed cubes under the Strategic insained of the P-3's 48 chutes.

Realizing a requirement for a large maritime patrol fleet during the mid-1990s, the Canadian government set about to purchase six additional aircraft. Budget shortfalls terminated this effort, but Canada ordered there there at the P-3'C production line in June of 1989. These aircraft differed from the standard CP-140 in several ways and thus were given the designation CP-140 and the Antoa the Antoa. The three Arcturus aircraft were then Satransoff the Batista Orsellite. The Burshana production line prior to Lockedhouse Pro-3's production for Materials, Georgia. The dextrus has the standard P-3 site occupancy number; however, it does not have the weight-mounted ESM system installed on the CP-140, nor does it have MAD installed in the tail signier. It was originally envisioned that these CP-140s would be used as "some birds," to be used for pilot training and familiarization. Instead, the aircraft have been omitted with non-acoustic sensors that allow the Acturus to perform many maritime patrol missions. Serial numbers assigned to the CP-140s are 14019 to 14021.

Besides the CP-140CP-140A-16AFour CP-140s (fromt to back: LO-VP/140105, GX-MV14011, 140101, and 140113) assigned to 14 Wing are lined up at their home of Canadian Forces Base (CFB) Greenwood, Nova Scotia. They are painted with World War Two-style fuselage roundlets and colorful tail art for the 75th Anniversary of the Royal Canadian Air Force (REAF), which occurred on 1 A CP-140 (140107) overlines a merchant using docked in a Canadian Port.

CFB Greenwood hosts 14 Wing, composed of 404, 405, and 415 Saquartons, while CFB Connors play host to 407 Squadron. Canadian Aurons have seen duty in the global war on terrorism as part of Operation APULLLO. (David Reade Collection via Rick Burgess)

## Appendix E E-3

Five EP-3 (no designation suffix) Orion electronic reconnaissance aircraft were built between 1991 and 1998. The JMSDP assigned these aircraft to the 81st _Kohland_ at Iwakami. These aircraft operate in the Signals Intelligence (SIGNT) role in a manner similar to the US Navy's EP-3E. They are distinctive with two large dorsal domed antenna ratings on the forward and foreslee and one under the forward fuselage, as well as the smaller dome (common with the later P-3C) for which satellite communications. The deled MAD gear gives the aircraft a botheallized appearance.

Appendix G Additional
The 51st _Kobatai_ also operates the single **UP-3C** Kawasaki built in 1995. This aircraft features a long air-disk sensor extending from the standard side on the forward fuselage. The UP-3C side used for research, development, test, and evaluation work, and for radar calibration. An NP-3C was intended for the latter role, but it was never built.

### Op-3c

The Japanese are converting five P-3Cs into **OP-3C** (formerly designated UP-3C) multi sensor surveillance aircraft. These are believed to be similar in role to the US Navy's P-3C (SP) special projects aircraft. The OP-3Cs will be assigned to the 81st _Kobatai_ and are believed to be equipped with a sophisticated sensor suite. This includes a radar, a side-looking radar, an infrared sensor, and electronic surveillance measures.

### Up-3d

The JMSD's acquired three **UP-3D**s from Kawasaki between 1998 and 2000. These provide electronic threat simulation for the JMSD surface fleet in a manner once performed by US Navy P-33. These aircraft are flowny by the 81st _Kobatai_ and are also believed to have operational electronic surface capabilities. They feature no large dorsal antenna domes on the forward and off fuselages and one vertical dome under the alt fusselage. A came antenna fariting is installed under the forward fuselages.

## IIAF (Later IRAF) P-3F Orion

In the early 1970s, the Iranian government under Shah Mohammad Reza Pathavi embarked on an massive effort to re-equip the Imperial Indian Air Force (IIAF) with modern equipment. This included purchasing McDonnell Duggles F-4 Phantom, Northrop F-5 Tiger, and Grumman F-14 Tracton figures. The IIAF placed an order for six export models of the P-3C Orion in 1973.

The P-3F-3 was based on the P-3C airframe and included that variant's 48-round sconomy external I have, as a hybrid assistant featuring the P-3C airframe and an avoicise state that consisted of equipment from P-3A, B, and C models like the P-3F Wing Field with the AN/APS-115 surface search radar and the KA-74A camera system in the distinctive nose facing. The mission systems were similar to those on the earlier P-3A and P-3B. This was done because the US Government was resistant to export the latest Anti-Subanum Warfaire (ASW) mission systems. Events would prove the soundness of this design.

Deliveries of the P-3F to Iran In heparin in April of 1975 following initial pilot training at NAS Moffet Field, California, These Groups were originally painted in the ten-standard White over Light Gray scheme, with large national inspirsing. The P-3Fs were replaned in a striking trace-one Blue Over Light Blue-Gray scheme with small national inspirsing prior to leaving the United States. These structural were initially based at Bandar Abbas, but were moved to Nitrate after the Islamic Revolution in 1979.

The IIAF aircraft were assigned US Navy Bureau Numbers ranging from 159342 to 159347. Corresponding Iranian serial numbers were 5:8701 through 5-8706. While all these aircraft were essentially identical, 5-8702 was wired for AGM 84 Phantom SMBMs. This MTS were 1004 destroyed in 1985. The IIAF had originally planned for a factor of 18 P-3Fs. Three P-3Fs were ordered, but were never built.

The US terminated suggest following the Shih's fall in early 1979. The IIAF was renamed the Islamic Republic of Iran Air Force (IIAF). This of events did not stop T-3F operations; however, the number of Djude aircraft decreased with time. P-3Fs often shaked US Navy ships in the Persian Gulf and Arabian Sea during the 1980s and 1990s, but only two Orios remained by jebany of 1991. A growing indigenous aircraft industry and Iran's purchase of aircraft from other countries may mean the end of IAF-3F operations is close at hand.
