## Morane-Saulnier MS 405/406

The Morane-Saulnier MS 405 was designed to the _STAR_ (_Service Technique Advantionatiques_: Aeronautical Technical Service) specification of July of 1934. The design team under Rene Gather saw conventional construction techniques to provide the _Armete de la Virte_ with its first modern fighter. The fuselenghe had four aluminum tubes connecting the bulkheads and wire-shaped straws, while the wings used to light glass with such tips. The alternate was still thinner, by running, a composite material formed by bonded layer oflywood and aluminium.

The MS 405 had a suspension of 10.62 m (34 feet 10 and 18 inches), a length of 8.17 M (02 feet 9 Sels inches), and a height of 2.71 M (8 feet 101/116 inches). The aircraft weighted 2440 xos (53729 5290 5) fully loaded. It had a maximum speed of 443 xos (2733 374) at 4000 x (13.123 dex) and a ramp of 100 xos (6241 m). The designed armchair was one 200ht Hispano-Suz S0 common fringe through the propeller hub and two wing-mounted 7.50ht (mean machine guns.

The MS 405 prototype (Aircraft01) was built at the company's Stateux plant and assembled at Vilimeboudny affixed near Paris. It made its first flight from Vilimeboudny on A Sugar 1935, with Mourane-Saulnier split pitch Director on the controls. This aircraft was powered by 8800 in Hispano-Suzsia 12YGs 12-cylinder liquid-cooled, inline engine, which turned a three-body-based two-photon Chawica propeller. It was also filled with a fixed undercrawing, which was eventually replaced by a fully stretchable Messier man undecreasing.

For minor afirm modifications were needed as a result of early test flights. The MS 405-01 was modified to carry two 7.50ht MAC 7594 machine guns instead of the Dance waves and an OP, 31 reflector gap still was installed. The Chawice propeller was replaced by a three-shaded Raiter 1495M variable-pitch propeller. On 20 February 1936, Morane-Sulnier presented the aircraft to the _Carne d'Essia du Materiel Acie_ (_CEMA_; Air Material Research Center) a Vilimeboudny for official evaluation.

The MS 405-01 completed approximately 180 flight tests from February of 1936 until August of 1937. The only problem encountered during these tests was lateral instability when the power was off. This was corrected by increasing wing dihedral from 5's 43 minutes to 6'51 minutes. This prototype was used as a demonstrator for potential foreign sales until it was destroyed in a crash on 8 December 1937.

The second MS 405 prototype first free or Villimeboudny on 20 January 1937. This aircraft formed from the first prototype in using a larger Chawice three-baked propeller. This required rather than landing garst was to insure proper ground clearance. The MS 405-02 was involved in two minor accidents during the spring of 1937 before it was destroyed in a crash on 29 July.

Despite these shocks, the _Miniere de La Virte_ (Air Ministry) ordered 16 pre-production of 3405 on 1 March 1937. These aircraft offered in only minor details from the second prototype. The first pre-production MS 405 (N0 1) made its initial flight of 3 February 1938. This aircraft was used for evaluation at CEMA, while No 2 flow component details at the _Carne d'Essiere_ (Experimental Center) at Rheims. Information from the test flights led to the _Miniere de La Virte_ (Aria) placing a contract of 30 production aircraft designated MS 406 in April of _Miniere_ These figures were built by _Scientific Automatic Communications Advances de l'e_ (Suscano), National Aircraft Construction Company of the Wesol's at Nantes-Boquigens, (Suscha) Acquired Morane-Saulnier during the 1936 nationalization of French aircraft industry. A second order for 80 MS 406s was placed with SSCADe the following August.

The first MS 405C1 warms up its engine during testing in 1935. An 860 \(\times\) Hispano-Suzsia 12YGs 12-cylinder "Seeing powering the fighter. The powering turned a three-baked and Chawice propeller via a reduction gear, which reduced the engine shaft's speed to a more manageable speed for the propeller. The prototype lacked national markings while it was owned by Morane-Saulnier for manufacturers' tests.

The fourth pre-production MS 405 was completed as MS 406 No 4 and first flew on 20 May 1938. It was powered by 880 to 1989 Hispano-Suzia I2731 21-cylinder, liquid-cooled, inline engine, which turned a Chauvine 351m three-baked, north-pileile propeller. Late production aircraft were fitted with a Ratler 1607 three-baked, variable-epoch propeller. The wing structure was modified after tests determined the wings could sustain greater loads than designed, due to the Plymax covering. The three outer ribs in each wing (port and standpoint) were lightened and the six oblique strangers were vetoed to three, three streamed chungers 235 to 507.

The MS 405 had a visible of 10.61 (84 feet 93 at inches), a length of 8.13 (26 feet 8 1716 inches), and a height of 2.71 (8 feet 1011/16 inches). The aircraft weight 1893 x (4173 s) penumbly emply and 2626 to 57892 pounds) fully loaded. Maximum speed of the MS 405 was 864 Giant (302 h) at 500 at (641.246). Its service ceiling using 8400 x (30.839 s feed) and its range was 1000 x (6421.4). The MS 406 was armed with one 2004 Hispano-Suzia S25 on system 60 from fringe through the propeller half. In March of 1939, this weapon was replaced on the 95th MS 406 by a Hispanic-Suzia I48 carbon, whose 700 manup per minute (gray) time rate was superior to the 595-400 state. The BS rate of 204 had a smaller velocity of 850 km (78.768) per second one. One 57th MS 1045 match to 134 hours per spin with 300 rounds per spin were mounted in each wing.

The Argentine international situation prompted the _Misiake de LaYi_ to order 825 additional MS 406s from the SNCAO production lines in April of 1938. The inefficiency of this arrangement led the Ministry to change the contract after No 65 to 950 aircraft from one pre-production line at Nantes-Boppensium in January of 1939. Lingering production difficulties resultat in only 12 MS 406s in _Article de LaYi_ service on 1 January 1939. Production steadily increased to six decimal part by day by April of 1939.

Seven pre-production MS 405 were delivered to _Groupe de Chaeae_ (GC) 1/7 (1st Fighter Group, 7th Eicore/Wing) at R

at short range, due to the 7.5mt MAC 1934 machine gun's low muzzle velocity (800 \(\pm\)0.2647, left per second). The other reason was the defensive machine gun fire from the German bombers, which often forced French pilots to fire their guns outside the MAC's effective range and reduced the likelihood of hits.

Despite these difficulties, storage pilots achieved a number of successes during the Battle of France. On 13 May 1940, six GC II2 38 406s show stout stin Messesheim II 1010 twin-engine fighters in less than 20 seconds. This MS 406s defined four Juzzles WA 88 bombres without loss to themselves on 5 June. Two notable successes occurn of a Juzzle, including the outcome of three BT 109 ns in seconds of combby Corbino Cagp Vollmer of GC 12, The same way was in MS 406s of the same _Groupe_ scene in confirmed certificates against the loss of two of their aircraft.

The French host approximately 300 MS 406s during the Battle of France, including 150 to Lathwarke aircraft and anti-sircraft fire. The latter figure included approximately 30 Monteses downed by small arms free during low-level operations against armored formations. The remaining 150 s M 406s were lost due to accidents or were rendered unservecube during executions from airfields threatened by German ground forces. Frequent deployments of fighterusin ironf airfields under German threat resulted in disorganized Repair and maintenance work. Their events destroyed many MS 406s and other French aircraft to prevent them from falling into enemy lands, the _Large 4/17_ post 75 MS 406s during this campaign, or of 144 French fighter pilots killed in the Battle of France.

Four Fighter Groups in Metropolitan France still fire the MS 406 when the Armilios with Oceanborne office are 2 June 1940. (The Armilios was originally signed three days before at Redmonds in the forest of Compleeg). Three Fighter Groups in North Africa and in the Syria also flews MS 406s. These units were part of the _Armilios de Cirac de la Tourline_, the air force of the Vichy French regime in the unoccupied southern France. All 48-60g groups except GC 17 A Rayala, Syria were advanced in July and August of 1940. The _Loop-Ariz_ Air (SubClouds) Salor-de-Provene retrained Stone Montes advanced training, while _Exactons of Earth/American_ (Timing Squamous) at Toutline presented others into 1942.

On 10 June 1940, Italy declared war on France. The French High Command Teared on Inlain strike on the Suez Canal from the Alpspan province of Topitollina and ordered GC 17 to deploy forn Royal, Syria to Imalinis, Egypt, along the Canal. Three MS 406s flews to Imalinis on 23 June; however, the Armilios with Germany became effective two days later and halted further deployments from Royal. The pilots who flews to Imalinis with their MS 406s joined the pro-rail _Forest Arcines Francies_ (Farid, Free French Air Force). The MS 406s were formed with other French aircraft in the _Groupe de Conduct_ (GC: Combtor Group 2). GC 2's Montes flews with Royal Air Force (RAI) Gloster **Ghattud** and Havder Hurricane fighters in the British campaign against pro-Axis Virb French foresi in Syria, which began on 8 June 1941, GC 17 elements in Syria raised the Allied foreses and flew 591 operational sortries during the campaign. Virbyla MS 406s joined claimed two confirmed 'kill' and two probable reviewers over Allied aircraft. The campaign ended in victory for the British and Free French forces on 12 July, the RAF commandered the surviving narrowly MS 406s of GC 17. These fighters became the basic equipment of the Free French _Groupe de Chasse "Alsoc"_, which was established at Ryvak on 15 September 1941.

while an additional order was placed for 50 Peez 633 B2s.

SNCAN offered the Peez 63 series for export customers during 1937. Orders were soon placed by China (four 631 CSa and five 633 B2). Greece (24 633 B2s), Romania (26 633 B2s, later followed by 20 more aircraft), Switzerland (one 603 C3 and one 633 B2), and Yugoslavia (two 633 C3 and one 631 C3). The Czechsoukian company via geographical a production license for the Peez 633 C3 variant, specifically for Czechsoukian requirements. The Swiss order was the one unfolded before the outbreak of World War Two.

Full Production of Peez 633 mernt began in May of 1937 at three SNCAN factories: Candebee (Isstabe and nil), Le Havre (wrings) and Mesatile (final assembly; later moved to Les Muevas). The first production Polez 630 was of the Atlantic in February of 1938, and made its first flight flight sooner. The _Arnee of 4' Air's Pint Equipment_ plan - approved on 15 March 1938 - called for 200 Peez 631 three-set day fighters (C3) and two-set night flight-res (CN), _Plan_'s also called for 449 Peez 633 light day bothers however, this was later changed to Peez 6313.

SNCAN delivered the first Peez 63 series postdoctoral aircraft (Peez 602 No 8) to the _Arnee_ of 4' Anaya 2013 May 1938, however, the first aircraft formally handed wave Peez 630 No 5 on 2 August 1938. Shortway of engines, propoles, and cambon delayed production and deliveries of Peez 630 and 633, Sony early aircraft were mainly with four machine guns instead of the two cannon as a temporary measure. _Plan_ V called for 201 Peez 630/631 air-carb to 1 January 1939; however, only 45 630 and 27 631 slew on charge at that date. An additional 74 aircraft were at the SNCAN factory using series. Production conditions slightly improved by 1 April, when 77 Peez 630s and 88 Peez 631s were accepted by the _Arnee of 4' Air_. These results included 67 Peez 630 and 20 Peez 631s assigned to operational units; the remaining aircraft were used for training.

Six Peez 635 series C3 circuit were assigned as fighter directors to each single-engine Figure Wiss (_Escudeude & Casses_). Two _Grapee & Casses_ in that (C3N; Night Fighter Groups) - GCN III/1 and II/4 - replaced their ancient ANF-Les Muevas I13s with Peez 630s and later with Peez 631s. GC II8 replaced their obsolete Muevas-Sailtier MS 225 and _The First Peez 631 prototype is parked on the Industrial and SILOTAs **Meath**e factory during Harch of 1937. This aircraft retained the Peez 630's afterframe while substituting two 670 w w Gnome & Rhone 148M Mars engines. Engine constructor intake soops were not yet fitted to the lower counting. (Via G. Grod)

The tenth production Polez 630 (C-522) is airborne on a crew familiarization flight. This aircraft was a C3 (Three-Seat Fighter) version for no-flight fighter direction. The two at crew-en opened their campaigns, while the pipts carry was closed. Pre-war Peez 630s were delivered to operational units in bare metal with basic margins.

Deochting D. 510 single-setfighters with 18 Peez 631s. Four Peez 631s were delivered to bew-formed GAN (Grupee _Arne_ Mirch; Mixed Air Group) 500 at Marijuana. A similar flight was established in Djibetti in northeast Africa in August of 1939.

By August of 1939, the _Arnee of LaP_ had 88 Peez 630s on charge, including 65 aircraft in fire line units. The French also had 20 Peez 631s on strength, with 117 in fire line units. The Peez 63 series external equipped on _Eleude & Casses_ (Fighter Wings), two _Groupes_ _Geaches de Caste du_, one _Grupee Arica_, and detachments in Djibetti and Tunisia.

A late production Polez 631 (No 191, military registration X-860) is parked after delivery from SNCAN to an Ambeze or Flat unit in 1939. The upper surfaces were Khakk, Dark Brown, and Dark Blue Gray over Light Blue Gray undersurfaces. No roundups were painted on the fusetage sides at this time and 30 cu (11 13/16 inch) diameter roundjets were placed on the upper wing tgs.

## Bloch 151/152

Avions Marcel Bloch designer Maurice Roussel designed the Bloch 150 as a private venture to meet the 1934 CI specification by the STAC (_Service Technique Accounting_; Aeronautical Technical Service). This all-metal, low wing cantilever memorise was powered by an 850 \(\pm\) 360 \(\mu\)m Gromee & Rhone 14 Ks 14.4e-cylinder, air cooled, metal engine. Prototype construction began at Bloch's Courteville run 1935 and was completed in early 1936. The Air Ministry's performance for the Monneau-Saulier MS 406 allowed the Bloch 150's development into 1937. The 1936 nationalization of France's aircraft industry sur Avions Marcel Bloch joining _Scaffectation de Customes Atronatiques At Montestiques At Stu-Onesti_ (SNACSO; National Aircraft Construction Company of the Southwest).

In 1937, Bloch 150 development resumed and the prototype was sent from Courteville to all the _Center of Eksawa at Materialerica_ (ECEMA; Air Material Test Center) at Villoshoho. Test Solider Apache Cravale fleew the prototype on its national flight for Villosho on a May 1937. The aircraft experienced ground handling problems and was fitted with a new Messier undercame. This landing gear caused a slight redesign of the wing, increasing its wing area from 15 \(\pm\) 40 (151.5 square feet) to 15 \(\pm\) 5 (165.2 square feet). The modified Bloch 150 beam again on 29 September 1937, but its engine showed a lack of power. The aircraft was returned to Courbovic to receive an 8090 m Gromee & Rhone 148/47 radial engine. The Bloch 150 was returned to CEMA for further tests in February of 1938. The aircraft was refitted at Villosho with an 1135 uri Gromee & Rhone 148/2-21 radial engine, which offered improved cooling and lubrication.

**The Bloch 150 was modified with a new wing center section in the late summer of 1937.**

Wing modifications were needed for the new Messier landing gear, which retracted into wells fitted ahead of the wing torsion box. The prototype was unarmed, although 20au common fariings were installed on the wing leading edges. (G. Botquin)

MS 406 production delays resulted in heightened Aviation Ministry interest in the Bloch fighter. The Ministry awarded two contacts to SNACSO on April 1938. One was for 25 per-production Bloch 150s with an option for 450 additional aircraft. The other contract was to develop three prototypes, each equipped with Gnome & Rhone 14P, Hispano-Suzia 14Aa, and Pratt & Whitney Twin Wang engines.

The Bloch 150 was designed to fly at 550 katu (541.8 nstru); however, testing soon revealed engine cooling problems that prevented the aircraft from approaching this speed. Ammane tests with the two wing-mounted 2000 flight/30au 525 common proved more successful. Bloch designer Laden Seramy's team redesigned the Bloch 150 airframe to rectify performance shortfalls and make it more suitable for mass prediction. This effort led to a new aircraft, designated Bloch 151.1 retained the Bloch 150's experiment appearance, but featured a new wing with 520 minute dihedral (upward angle). The fuselage retained a semi-monocapacul' structure, with an all action magic into two vertical halves beled together. The Bloch 150's tilt was well exposed by a tail solid.

The Bloch 151 had a wing span of 10.54 katu for 1516 inches, a length of 9.91 \(\pm\) 15 (16 inches), and a height of 36.4 (171 feet 15/6 inches). The aircraft weighed 2073 to (4570.1 pounds) empty and 2522 katu (6550 pounds) fully loaded. Its maximum speed at 2600 (8530.2 feet) was 437 katu (271.5 nstru). The Bloch 151 had a range of 640 katu (397.7 line).

The Bloch 150's two 400 L (105.7 gallous) using flat rules were replaced by one fuselage mounted 415.1 (10.69 gallous) float Lau on the Bloch 151.1 All controls surfaces were metal covered, instead of the fabricoured surfaces commonly used on aircraft during this period. The Bloch 151's original powerlawman was the 910 \(\pm\) 900 m Gromee & Rhone 148/14-14/cylinder, aircooled, radial engine. The engine was mounted 2.5' to put to counter engine torque. The 148-11 turned a three-bladed, variable pitch Chauvinere Doppler. Two 20au S9 common and two 7.58au MS 1934 machine guns were mounted in the wings.

The first production Bloch 151 made its malaction flight from Villoshohoulay on 18 August 1938, 1937. Some continuous airflows carry part of the subordinate body by its transcribing combination and part by the second 45-kilad.

The engine mount was lengthened to move the center of gravity forward, the horizontal stabilisers were enlarged, and a Gnome & Rhone propeller was fitted. Flight sets at CEMA began on 8 September 1938, which resulted in a new radar, a modified oil cooler, and other modifications to the Bloch 151.

The French government amended its 7 April 1938 contract with SNCASO for 475 Block 151s, reducing this effort to 432 aircraft in time batches. The first production batch consisted of 144 Block 151s powered by the Gnome & Rhone 148-35 engine. The 288 remaining aircraft were on improved machines, designed Robot 152. The Block 152 order was split between 144 aircraft with 148-25 engines 144 with 1120 m at 184-24 engines.

The Block 152 retained the basic construction of the earlier Bloch 151. The newer fighter had a wingengine of 10.57 m at (34 feet 18 inches), a 0.33 (17 s 108 inches) increase over the Bloch 151. This increased the wise area from 17.21 w/ (18.53 square feet) to 18.17 w/ (195.6 square feet). The wing dihedral remained at 520 minutes; however, the Block 152's horizontal stabilisers decreased a 17.02 m/mote diameter. The horse aerodynamic refinement improved lowered lowered the characteristics and reduced drag compared to the Bloch 151. The Block 151's length of 9.11 x (9.26 feet 10 11/6 inches) and height of 3.64 x (11 feet 114 inches) were retained on the Bloch 152. The new fighter weighed 2298 s (5066.1 pounds) empty and 2706 x (5956.6 pounds) fully loaded.

Rodolphe Blanc fleve the Bloch 152 prototype (No-43) on its first flight from Villocubayt on 15 December 1938. The first was retrofitted with an 1120 m 148-25 engine and a four-loaded fixed pitch Chavette 5414 popular in January 1939. The Bloch 152 reached 530 Kato (239 mph) in level flight during tests at CEMA in February. Weak climb performance led to tests using other properties, eventually settling on the three-flashed, variable pitch Chebyshev7 Doppler, gasoline cooling problems resulted in trials using various exhausts' terms and cowling with different aperture diameters. This problem was never fully solved on the Bloch 152, which would systems coatings during production. The production field had a maximum speed of 500 kton (31.7 m/s) as 5500 m (18.044.6 feet). The Bloch 152's service ceils to 1000 s (32.808.048 feet) and its wings was 5800 x (5640 s) miles.

The aircraft displayed unwanted reactions when the undercarriage and flags were lowered. It was easy to fly; however, the counts were slight-by theory. The Bloch 152 and good stall characteristics with no tendency to spin. It could turn tighter than a Deweting D.520, not not as tightly as the Mome-Sailtier MS 406. The Bloch fighter was a stable gun plan when it fired its 2004 cannon.

## Bloch 151/152 Production and Deliveries

Blotch 151 and 152 production was split among several SNCASO plants: Chakenoroux-Dots (fuselagos), Bordeaux-Morgane and Sureens (wings), and Rochefort-sur-mer (tail assemblies). Final assembly of the first 19 aircraft was split between Courbeveveve and Chakenoroux-Dots. Aircraft 20 through 500 were assembled at Bordeaux-Morgane (odd-authored) and Dodelsons. After the 151-152 production was split among several SNCASO plants: Chakenoroux-Dots (fuselagos), Bordeaux-Morgane and Sureens (wings), and Rochefort-sur-mer (tail assemblies). Final assembly of the first 19 aircraft was split between Courbeveveve and Chakenoroux-Dots. Aircraft 20 through 500 were assembled at Bordeaux-Morgane (odd-authored) and Dodelsons Blone fleve the Bloch 151-10 on his maiaden flight from Villocubayt on 18 August 1938. The original cowling fit closely over the engine, with ratings placed over the rocker arms. Engine overheating problems resulted in changes in the cowling shape. The cook-fit was placed westward from Bloch 150 s series lightures. (Std Aviation)

This Bloch 151 (No 75, Y-562) was assigned to GC 11/0 at Le Havre-Octeville in January 1940. The military registration was black on the wave underestimates. The plot tube was mounted on the stardardard wing of production Bloch 1515: this tube was placed on the prototype's port wing. The wing flaps fully lowered when hydraulic power bleed off after flight. (8, Johome)Chicaneuro-Dodds (even-numbered). From aircraft No 301 in January of 1940, the Chicaneuro-Dodds plant assembled all other Bunch 151s, while the Bordeaux-Mergine facility concentrated in producing the Block 174 twin-engine reconnaissance aircraft. Components shortages resulted in 61 of the 696 Bloch 152s ordered not being completed.

The _Arnne de la'ar_ officially accepted is fast block 152 (20 e4) per March 1939. Nine more aircraft were accepted by mid-May for operational tests by CEMA and the _Carne Cerne/Eyevices_ (Test Center) at Rhesus. An _Excellified &Eyevices_ (Test Standard) was formed on 1 July 1939 and deployed from Rhesus to Orleans-Bridge. SNC300 produced 249 Bleech 151/512s by France's entry into World War Two on a Scepentent 1939, the _Arne de la'ar_ and officially accepted 123 of these aircraft into service. Many Bcribd fishgers were grounded on the lack of proprietary, radios, or unmanned, while a few aircraft were fitted with four-bladed flood-flight wooden properties. Operational tests demonstrated continuing engine problems. The resulted in more waiting on a 855 m (2 for 9716 inch) diameter opening and manually-operated cowl flaps. The evolving was standard on new production block 152s and was recruited to existing aircraft. The Bloch 151s were assigned to training and home defense units, due to their disperfing performance.

Additional modifications were required for the Bloch152s to be declared _for the garre_ (5 food for warr ; i.e., serviceable). These included a downward-blowing exhaust collector with beating air for the carburter and wing guns, a semi-reversed oil cooler, and mechanical main landing gear lock. Shortages of 2020 cannot act to priority given to Bloch 152s, with most 1851 s length and four four 7.5Man machine guns.

Production difficulties resulted in the _Arne de la'ar_ having only 140 Bloch 151s and 563 Bloch 152s in service on 10 May 1940 - the day Germany invaded the Netherlands and Belgium. These totals included 37 Bloch 151s and 53 Bloch 152s at fully operational status.

The coupling also included inclined exhaust pipes on both port and saturated sides. Pilot-controlled control flaps fitted to the atl cowling section allowed heated it to escape the coupling. Despite these measures, engine overheating remained a major problem for the Bloch 152 throughout its service career.

A pilot sits in the coolest of a Bloch 152 prior to takeoff. This aircraft was equipped with the Bank-Lemaitre G43-8 detector on sign, which was mounted atop the instrument panel. Small lights are projected from the gun split base onto an angled piece of glass, which enabled the pilot to aim at last moving targets. Some Bloch 1517/152 were equipped with the Opt-spin split, which included a Lantraine (the Lantraine). A ring-and-bead auxiliary gun sight mounted ahead of the windshield was used in case the reflector sight failed.

The Bloch 152 throttle was mounted on a curved console along the port cockpit wall, immediately at of the instrument panel. Dots pulled out of an French throttle to increase power, in the opposite manner of most aircraft trotuites. The Bloch 152 cockpit was well instrumented, but many indications were hard to read. This included several instruments placed on the center console, forward of the control stick. French aircraft trotuve were Protective Green (P814108) with black instrument beagles. Seat belts and shoulder harassets were taa with silver bucks.

## Bloch 151/152 in Combat

The first operational Bloch 152 unit was _Groupe de Chasse_ (GC; Fisher Group) I/1 at Chanilly, which received from first three aircraft on a October 1939, Outd 35 of 162 Bloch 152 delivered had the standard three-shaded Chavrule Doppler. Gonen de Rhoge pepellers were fitted to 40 machines, while another 40 aircraft had fixed eight-shot wooden perspectives. Forty-were Bloch 152s lacked propellies. GC II was fully equipped with 25 Bloch 152s by the end of October, followed by GC II/1 and GC I/8 by the end of 1939. SVACSON allowed 274 Bloch 152s by 10 January 1940; however, only 88 of these were operational. The first fully operational Bloch 152 direct from the factory was finally delivered to the _Amke of FA_ on 5 March 1940. The French Air Staff considered these machines the only Bloch 152s suitable for combat.

Seven _Groupe de Chasse_ were equipped with Bloch 151s and 152s on 10 May 1940, when German foresees attacked Western Europe. These units had a total of 55 Bloch 151s and 140 Bloch 152s, but only 26 Bloch 151s and 273 Bloch 152s were synthesized. The Bloch 152s were synthesized. The Bloch 152s short-comings were then acquired from 1939 different from the Karlsruheen. The first experiment could neither fly fast nor rapidly climb. It had a short range of only 500 km (8704.043 miles) and both its radio equipment and variable-pitch propellers were unreliable. The Bloch 152s positive qualities included its maneuverability, its two wing-mounted 2000 magnet, and its ability to take heavy punishment and continue flying. On one occasion, a batch returned to base with at least 360 bullet and one on shell does scattered over its airframe.

 Bloch 151/152 pilots launched 14 German aircraft shed down during the Battle of France, with 34 probable velocities. These "kill" included 44 Messerschmitt Bitt 1978, 25 B7 110s, 33 Dornier D0 TJ bommes, and 28 Bzihele III, Nesp 270 Bloch 151s and 152s were lost to combat or abandoned to the theory, Cassimilants among Bloch pilots loaded 40 killed 42 und 40uated.

Two more Esteper Groups mentioned to Bloch 152s during the Battle of France, bringing the total to nine _Groupe de Chasse_ to 152 aircraft on 5 June 1940. Additionally, eight _Escorillites de Defense_ de Chasse (Dense Sequences) fleur 34 Bloch 151s and 152s. These units were assigned to protect recent plants against Halvitanbornes. Two _Groupe_ (French Naval Aviation) solutions, _Escorillites_ AC2 and CA2, converted to Bloch 152s in April and May of 1940, respectively. _Esc._ AC3 glossed six species against Italian aircraft during June.

 Bloch plots were kept standard in Metropolitan France where the Armistic with Germany took effect on 25 June 1940. Only four AC3 pilots were able to cross the Mediterranean to Bone, Algeria, in Cracia et al that this. The free Zone of Voids France 230 Babot Fibanes (61 Bloch 152s, 260 Bloch 152s, and nine new Bloch 158s) on ten April 20 July. These aircraft formed the backbone of the _Amke of EtA_ for _A_/_transitive_ (Vicity French Air Force), operated by six _Grougees de Chasse. An Aeronautiv at Saint Raphael Treve Blue 152s. The Germans appeared in 1733 writing Bots when they invaded Voids France 13 November 1942. Several Bloch 152s were used by the Lauffroak as advanced trimers and for local fighter duties with 22/56/Separation/30/100 _UgedThis Bloch 152 (White 1, No 359) was shown by Capulating Canned of the 3rd Escarding (S Squadron) of Groupe de Chasse (GC: Fighter Group) 1/9 (th Escards/Wind). Command (Mail) Rollet led GC 1/9 when they re-equipped with the Bloch 152 in May of 1940. The unit was credited with 16 confirmed videos over German aircraft during the Battle of France. These'slits' included six Its 126s, five De 73s, two It 111s, two 167 109s, and one De 215.

This Bloch 152, White 1, was assigned to the 3rd Escarding of GC 1/9 at Calais-March. The Squadron's blue shark ins insisting was placed immediately at the canopy, although this was hardly discernible against the camouriage.

## Bloch 155

In October of 1938, a production Bloch 152 (30, 43%) was modified to accept the 1200 mV Part & Whitney R-183053-G Twin Wasp. This American powerlaw was 14-cylinder, air-cooled, metal engine. The Twin Wasp turned a three-baid Hamilton problem. This aircraft was designed **Bicot Bicot Bicot** 153 and first few air Villocuboyola on a April 1939. The aircraft was tested at CLMA before being accepted by the _Arnte de ClArt_ on 28 May 1940. The Bloch 153 was to have been produced at CCNPovic; however, it was not ordered. The sole example was destroyed in a landing accident in the May of 1940.

Another Bloch 152 air failure was to be powered by another American engine, the 1200 mV Wright GR-1820-20025A Cyclone. This area is nine-cylinder, air-cooled radial engine. The fighter was designated below 154b, however, the engine delivery prevented the aircraft from being completed.

During the autumn of 1939, Bloch designer Lucion Servang began work on an improved performance variant of the Bloch 152. This new fighter - designated Bloch 155 - offered light- or speeds, generate energy and a smaller turning radius than the Bloch 152. The new fighter retained the Bloch 152's airframe to reduce development and production time. The engine cowling diameter was increased to eliminate rocker arm flairings and incorporate an oil cooler intake. Curved contour fitting was pushed over the existing lower fadening slimming. Other aerodynamic refinements included detection of the horizontal stabilizer bearing starts and a cockpit positioned further at. The cockpit was moved 0.5 M (1607 11/11/6 inches) at halfway for an additional 0.1 U.S./g gallo park tank in the forward fadening.

The aircraft had the same vineggan and length as the earlier flight 152 - 0.5 M (344 feet 8 1/18 inches) in twispband and 9.1 M (5067 11/6 inches) in length. The Bicot 155 wood S55 \(\times\) 12 (164 1/12 inches) in height, 0.3 M (1607 3/16 inches) in width than the Bloch 155 washed 2140 x (6717.8 pounds) empty and 2850 x (6283.1 pounds) fully loaded.

The Bloch 155 prototype leaks during its flight test program during the winter of 1939-04. This was a standard Bloch 152 modified for a more powerful Gnome B & Rhone 144-49 engine. The larger engine cowling lacked the rocker arm ratings of the Bloch 152 evolving. Horizontal stabilizer bracing starts were deleted on the prototype, although they were reinstated on production Bloch 1556. (ML Cristese)

The Bloch 155 was powered by a 1100 up Gnome & Rhone 148N-49, a 14-cylinder, air-cooled, radial engine. It originally turned a three-baid Chawawsee 717ppeler, which was later replaced by a three-baid Bloch propeller. The Bloch 155 had a maximum speed of 520 xbit (523.1 MW) at 4500 M (14.763.8 feet) and had a range of 10500 xbit (652.2 miles). The Bloch 152's maximum speed was 500 kbit (301.7 MW) at 5500 kbit (8104.46 feet) and the range amounted 1500 kbit (550.40 m) inside the wire fighter retained the Bloch 152's maximum of two 2004 Hsinque-Sainra 840 cmous with 60 0 pounds per gun (xro) and two 7.50xM MAC 1934 machine guns still 500 Hz in the wings.

Munroe Belocors fle the prototype on its inside flight from Chawcuitova-Dools on 3 December 1939. The Bloch 155-01 performed well on its test flight, although it suffered a minor accident of Chawsee 4 February 1940. Horizontal stabilizer bracing starts were added and other slight modifications were made after the accident.

SNC800 now executed a contract for 403 Bloch 155, with production concentrated at Chileuxuxux-Dools. Production aircraft incorporated an additional 60 1 (15.9 gallos) of fuel and a more streamlined canopy. The initial position Bloch 155/30 (70.70) lane has first flight from Chawcuitova-Dools on 3 April 1940. Nine more aircraft were completed before the Amniucke became effective on 25 June 1940; the new station during the Battle of France. These Bloch 155s served with C 0.C.I.S./tle of the Vehroh Faru Forex at Montepeller and were joined by 19 aircraft built after the Amniucke commanded the remaining Bloch 155s after Germany occupied Vehro Prime In November 1942.

SNC8000 classified in a 13100 in Gome & Rhone 14R radial engine into a Bloch 152 in 1939, under the designation Bloch 156. The engine's weight of 819 x (1085.6 pounds) made an effective institution into the airframe afflicted and the Block 156 was completed.

Servangly decided to design a new fighter to take full advantage of the 14R engine, while retaining the Bloch 152's structural principles. Design and construction of the Bloch 157 proposed rapidly, with the aircraft being 159 in 500 Gnome & Rhone 14R-49 engine. The German advance on Paris resulted in SNC8300 personnel attempting to transport the Bloch 157 from Villocuboyola to Politec on 9 June 1940. German troops captured the aircraft before it could leave Villocuboyola and it was taken to Borokaux-McGrignac. The Bloch 157 was completed under German supervision and first five in March of 1942.

The Bloch 157 reached a maximum speed of 710 kbit (441.2 MW) at 7850 M (25.754.6 feet)

The first CR 714 production aircraft (cf/n 8533) is parked near a Caudron hangar at Guyancourt in September of 1938. This aircraft differed from the prototype by using a new air intake design, a slightly smaller vertical stabilizer, a refined wing-irlot selection, and a taller under carriage. This CR 714 was allocated the military registration 1-181, which was painted on the telescope sides. (Viz 4.1).

CR 714s at Guyancourt by mid June of 1940. Only eight Caudron fighters remained in southern France when the Armitsic went into effect on 25 June. None of these aircraft is believed to have flown in Vishy French service after the Armitsic.

Camounting and basic markings are painted on this newly built CR 714 during the spring of 1940. The cockpit energy offered the pilot limited visibility, especially downward. Cockpit access was made through sliding canopy panels, which were lefilsened in an emergency for ease of escape.

This CR 714 Cyclone (White 13) was assigned to the 2nd Escadific of GC 174S, a Polish cable until deployed to break on a June 1940. Soats-14 (LPLB 1.6). Although was believed to have flown this tighter. The Polish plots were officially credited with seven confirmed videos during the Battle of France. The Group lost four CR 714s in combat and five pilots killed, including Commandarar _local_ Kglinski, the sun's commander.

## CR 714 Derivatives

Castoron-Renault developed three CR 714 derivatives, which offered improved performance over the production fighter. The CR 760 (formerly CR 715) was powered by an Italian-built 730\(\pm\) Istous-Praschini Delta RC 40 -1 cylinder, at-cooled, time engine. It was slightly larger than the CR 714, with a swingment of 8.83 (256 \(\pm\) 12 inches), a length of 8.9 (35 per 10 \(\mu\)m) 2.6 (16 inches), and a height of 2.9 (87 \(\pm\) 0.6 \(\times\) 13 inches). The CR 760 weighted 1560 (3439-2 points) empty and 2050 (43519-490 monthly) fully loaded. It was ramped with six 7.5mM MAC 1934 machine guns under the wings with 3000 remarks per gun.

The aircraft first five in early May of 1940 and demonstrated it could climb to 4000 (13,1234 \(\pm\) 60) in minutes 25 seconds. The had a maximum speed of 455 (822.7900) at sea level and a range of 15000 (932.112), On 11 June, the CR 760 was burned at Orleans-Bray to prevent its capture by scavenging German troops.

The CR 700 was nearly identical in the CR 760 and first five during November of 1939. The fighter was powered by 800 \(\pm\) 800 \(\mu\)m 62 (652 \(\pm\) 165), three, at-cooled, time engine. It was unguyennt of 9.9 (267 \(\pm\) 651 \(\mu\)m), a length of 9.5 (326 \(\pm\) 73 \(\mu\)m), and a height of 2.9 (84 \(\pm\) 73 \(\mu\)m), a length of 1750 (3858 pounds) empty and 2250 (850 \(\pm\) 800 \(\mu\)m) fully loaded. The CR 700 was designed around such 590 \(\pm\) 500 \(\mu\)m (566.6900) at 500 (16.4600) at 2.6 (188 \(\mu\)m), and two was used (888.251). It was to be turned with six wing-mounted 7.5mM MAC 1934 machine guns. The CR 770 suffered a cannibal flutter early in its right figure. This engine was never repaired and the aircraft was destroyed at Gugyment before the Germans reached the airfield.

The CR 780 was proposed in August of 1938 as a fighter powered by a 500 \(\mu\)m 1640 (the engine driving two counter-rotating three-bladed propellers. The aircraft was designed to fly up to 530 \(\mu\)m (329.30 m) at 4000 sq; however, it was never built.

The CR 770C1 prototype (6m 8778) was another CR 714 derivative. This aircraft was near-by identical to the CR 760, but was powered by an 850 \(\mu\)m 650 \(\mu\)m (628 engine. The only CR 770 bulk was rolled out in mid-October of 1938 and that fleve the following month. The crankshaft talled during this flight and the aircraft never fle again.

120 additional D.520s ordered by the _Adenarude_ (French Naval Aviation).

The first production D.520 (F-187) made is initial flight on 31 October 1939, with the next three aircraft following in December. Production figures incorporated several changes from the three D.520 prototypes. The fuselage was lengthened by 51 cm (21/16 inches), the engine cowing was modified, two integral fuel tanks were added to the wing with leading edge, and a 50% ample plate was fitted off the tip's seat.

The D.520 was an all-metal monopine with a wingspan of 10.2 m (33 Geet 5/12 inches), a length of 8.6 s (208 2.5 s) inches, and a height of 2.57 s (8 feet 5/18 inches). It weighed 123 m (660 s) bounds every 2567 s (5091.7 pounds) fully loaded.

This powerful tunnel a three-blad-to, variable-height barrier 16004 Heidelberg-operated problem. It had a maximum speed of 5344 xan (318 nm) at 5500 x (18,044.6 feet) and a range of 1540 xu (556.9 miles). The figure was arranged with one 2004 hm (840 cm with 60 months flying through the propeller hull and four 7500 xu 3184 matches even in the wings with 675 pounds per gun.

Lengthy and difficult engine problems resulted in the first production D.520 not reaching Cazazaz for armicant trials until 26 December 1939. This resulted in the second production system being delivered earlier than expected to CEMA for performance evaluation on 10 January 1940. Official results recorded a maximum speed of 535 xu (332.4 nm) at 5400 x (77,716.5 feet) and a climb to 8000 x (26,246.7 feet) in 13 minutes 24 seconds. The service ceiling was 10,250 (33.6286 feet) and the range with a full fuel load was 150 xu (556.9 miles). Only 13 D.520s were produced by the beginning of 19104, compared to the 44 aircraft specified in the contract schedule. The side of adequate pulses and supercharger air intakes limited the maximum speed to 510 xu (316.9 nm). Four production aircraft (Nos. 13, 30, and 360 were returned to SNACM on 1 March 1940). Three D.520s served as test bots for improvements to these negative problems. The operational standard for the D.520 was not frozen until the 19th aircraft was rolled out for the factory in early April of 1940. \\ \end{tabular}

D.520, White 4, flies on a delivery flight during the spring of 1940. The lower radio receiver antenna extended in flight, while the transmitter antenna at off the coorbit was fixed. Short exhaust stacks were fitted to this D.520. The propeller spinner was black while the upper surfaces were cumulunged in Dark Ribe Gray (PS3817B), Dark Brown (FS2011T), and Khash (PS2408T).

The first production D.520 saw considerable service after performing SNACM tests in late 1938 and early 1940. The fighter was assigned to GC 177, the Armee to Fair's fourth D.520 fighter group.assigned squadron code 5, this aircraft was painted with the white Veriby Usage stripe and round round trim while operating from Alger-Malson Blanche airfield, Algeria in late 1940.

SNCASE modified D.S20 No 465 to enhance its performance in late 1941. This aircraft received the designation D.S200 _"Amateur_ (Upgraded). The modifications included fitting individual 'jet' exhaust pipes, a new Messier undercattering, a heat exchanger in place of the standard coil cooler, and a coolant radiator incorporating a bandgap layer time. The D.S20 _"Amateur"_ was powered by a 820 nm 12749 engine running a Chavsize 10105 propeller. The aircraft resulted a maximum speed of 575 s scan (57.3 nm) at 6500 s (213.255 feet). SNCASE built 197 late production D.S200 flighters for the _Amateur_ & _A/A/A/A/A_mittee from the 349 tonl 0. D.S200s produced between August 1941 and the end of 1942. These aircraft were similar to the D.S200 _"Amateur"_, but recently to the standard exhaust pipes.

D.S200 assigned to two Figure Groups and an _"A/A/A/A/A"_guide abandon in Syria fought against British and Free French forces in the summer of 1941. The three units scored a combined 30 coefficent and six probable vertices during this campaign, while losing 32 D.S20s (11 to air count, seven destroyed on the ground, and 14 to other causes).

_The Amateur & Air & Armitage_ had 173 D.S200 (including 142 services einerratt) with five _Groups_ (Cases and two naval Ceramics in North Africa as 8 November 1942. The Anglo-American invasion of French North Africa saw the Devroitness in heated combat with Allied combat aircraft. The French lost 35 D.S20s (16 by the air force, 19 by the newly during this campaign.

On 11 November 1942, Germany responded to the invasion of French North Africa by investigating unpouched France. The _A/A/A/A_mittee was obtained on 27 November and the Germans seized is 1876 aircraft, including 246 D.S20a. The insiders captured 169 additional D.S20s in various stages of assembly at SNCASE. Toulouse plant, the _C_-axis in August 1944, "American forces invaded southern France (Operation ANVIL). Four days later, the _C_-_Frontiers & _I_-In mid-June of 1940, D.520 No 41 was fitted with a 1200 \(\upmu\)r Hispano-Suzia 122899 engine, under the designation **D.524**. The azimuth was intended to reach an estimated speed of 616 kGauss (382.8 s smt). The Armitaine prevented any test flights and the D.524 was verified with a standard 12Y45 engine in July of 1941.

The **HD70**.98 engine lighter confined a modified D.520 fuselage with larger wings and twin flows. It was 97.7 (31 Gxfel 69 78 hches) and long had a winguspon of 12 uA (39 feet 4716 inches). The aircraft was powered by a Hispano-Suzia 12Y5 engine (lined with a low altitude compressor and was intended to reach a maximum speed of 442 (2074 77.00). One prototype was built between November of 1939 and April of 1940, but it never flew.

The **D.551** was a military variant of the **D.580**, a racing derivative of the D.520**. The D.550** is redefined by the D.550** reduced wing span of 93.33 to the Gxfel 7516 inches and greater stemming while powered by a 12Y51 engine. This figure resulted to reach a maximum speed of 662 (411.4 ms) at 6000 (19.688 sec). The D.551 was to have been turned with five 7.50at machine guns - one fringe through the propeller hub and four in the wings. The D.528 was a D.551 with a 122 engine over the additional wing mounted machine guns. The first five D.525 remained open when France joined the Armitaine with Germany. On 9 August 1940, the Germans allowed the conversion of two D.551s into **D.500** steps aircraft; however, the D.506s were later forbidden to fly and exposed with the other D.551s.

SNCASE passed with the German armitaine commission to produce 105 D.5202 fibels on 12 September 1942. The Forward House was suspended by 35.55 (C.14 (616 inches) and resampled to accept the 1000 ribeping-Suzia 122 engine. It was to be earned with two 200at cannon and two 7.50at machine guns in the wings. The first D.5202 was equipped with a 1200 \(\upmu\)r 1220 engine and a conventional 2.520w chip. This variant had an estimated maximal maximal speed of 697 (894 (5.08 smt) at 9150 (30.019.7 feet). The cameras were allowed to be 5.5020 for 19 and 1 remained in storage until 1947. Planers were made to use a testbed for the 122 engine intended for the **D.520** runers given the eight registration F-WEP). Engine problems delayed the first taxi test until 22 October 1948 and further testing was cancelled in January of 1949.

Standard D.520

Paired Exhaust Stacks
The D. 520 "Amfilor" engine coupling had a smoother finish than the coupling fitted to earlier D.520s. Six individual exhaust stacks per side replaced the paired stacks previously employed. A small auxiliary intake was mounted at the propeller spinner and the supercharger air inlet was placed low on the cowring side.

The horizontal tail surfaces of D.520 for 494 had the standard red and yellow stripping carried by Viehry French aircraft, Upper squares were painted Khakj, Dark Blue Gray, and Dark Brown, with light gray added to the windings. Standard 80 cu (31 1/2 inch) diameter French rounds appeared on the wings. The external dimensions of late production D.520s were the same as for standard D.520s.

## Foreign and Post-War Service

The German invasion of unoccupied (Viebry) France on 11 November 1942 resulted in the capture of 246 D.520s. The Germans directed SCASCAE to deliver 19 aircraft in full flight condition and complete assembly on 150 others on the production line. This task was completed by the summer of 1944, concluding D.520 production at 905 aircraft. These failures were primarily used as transients in three Laflaff _degorostation_ (Grs; Fisher WJSG, 101, 1630, and 1650, German ignition the D.520 s) maneuverfully, but found cross with take offs and landings not challenging. This difference in handling between the Dewolite fighter and German types resulted in high D.520 attrition in the Luffufflet.

The Germans transferred 60 D.520s to Italy, where they saw limited service with eight _Grupp_ (Groups).
