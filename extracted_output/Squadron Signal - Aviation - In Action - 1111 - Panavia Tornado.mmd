## Introduction

The Panavia Torrado had in beginnings on April 1965 (Baden Day in Great Britain) when the Chancellor, James Callaghan, rose in the House of Commons to announce that development of English Electric TR8-2 were so high that the project was cancelled. This decision left Britain without a metal strike and non-manicator aircraft, and it was stated that the Royal Air Force would purchase a number of General Dynamics F-111s to fill the Environment. This decision was short lived, since the F-111s suffered from a number of technical difficulties as well as directing goods, and the RAF never took delivery of the General Dynamics aircraft.

The TR8-2 had been developed as a replacement for the Cantera bomber and was one of the most advanced strike aircraft under development in the West. In the low-level strike rule, the TR8-2 would have been capable of sorting a 206 real maximum altitude and at speeds in excess of 0.9 Mach while carrying either nuclear or conventional weapons. A higher altitudes are that its wavelength to activate a spreadout to raise a spreadout to a 2060 pounds while combat radius was estimated to be 1.300 vertical miles with a 2060 pounds with nitrogen load. With external fuel tanks this range would be extended to nearly 1.350 vertical miles. The material also incorporated a high, whose undertaking will bring, how massive turns for operations from undeveloped mnways or forward operating guns strikes just behind the front lines.

As a reconnaissance aircraft the TR8-2 would carry Side-Looking Airborne Radar (SLAR) a moving target indicator on the radar and an infrared Innesan system with was capable of providing a TV type image both day and night. Despite its advanced technology, technical problems and rungston demand the aircraft.

The next project to intersect the British Government was the proposed Anglo-French Variable Geometry aircraft (AFVC) which was launched to be the mainstay of the RAF. Just two years after the TR8-2 was terminated, however, the Minister of Defense, Denis Healey, announced that the French Government had lost in the AFVC and had withdrawn from the project. At these time, he stated that British Aircraft Corporation (BAC) was to continue development of a variable geometry wing aircraft.

BAC, at their plant at Warnea were Person, Lancanstine, began building a number of test-ups needed to develop a successful swing-ahead. General Dynamics is expected towards the existence of the wing roots, well as difficulty in predicting the wing forcing on the F-111. As a result, BAC unveils of their effort on those areas. By the middle of 1980, BAC had produced a successful pivot beating made of Teflon, giving a better combination of strength and safety, since the fullage limits on this material were greater than a comparable metal part, BAC also built a complete wiring box that greatly improved the performance of the variable geometry wing.

During this period, the British began negotiations with a number of European countries concerning the possibility of producing a joint, anti-wide aircraft to enter service during 1995 (positionally known as the MRA-7, Multi-Rice Armentis 1997). The first three countries to join the program were Great Britain, Italy and West Germany. Others joined for a short period, including Belgium, Canada and The Netherlands. Later the site of the project was changed to the Multi-Rice Combact Aircraft (MRCA).

To design and build the new aircraft a new company was concerned, made up of personnel for the all participating nations in this company was called Panavia and was significantly in Germany. Panavia would overne the contracts and contracts the work of the prime affine contractors. BAC in England, Massachusetts-Holos-Bloch (MBB) in Germany, Avella is Italy and the engine contractor, Turbo Union in England.

The prototype MRCA emerged as a twin engineer, two seat aircraft with a shoulder mounted variable geometry (wind) wing that was capable of being moved from a full forward position of 25 degrees so that less support positioned 6/5 degrees. The straight abrasion portion for two pivoting underung signs, with the inland piston being configured to accept full tanks. The wing had no alarms, using spoilers to augment the taileness for roll control. The wing also had full length along to the movable period. The fly movable protection will exercise, known as tailers, anode collectively to serve as a conventional elevators for pitch control and, causing independently they served as a slit for roll control.

The flashing housed the terrain following radar behind a large pointed rungston, the two biologic cockp and asparate windscreen and both nose and main landing gear with. Focusing was made for two weapons prides under the flagging, each cabulet carrying a variety of Ordanea. It was planned that all effective software available by the current design works the wing portions carried hot tanks, offering air-to-air misles and defense ECU equipment.

The aircraft was powered by two 10,600 lbnt Turbo Union RR199-3GR Mk 101 short-burning turbaffin engines, which were occupied to give the MRCA in speed of Mach 2 at altitude and Mach 1.2 at sea level.

The first MRCA prototype (prototype 0, start D-950) made its flight into 43 August 1974, at Manheim, Wet Germany. The aircraft was born by BAC. Chief Test Pilot Panel Milli, with MBB Chief Test Pilot Multipliers as his book sooner. The intrinsic flight thus was monitored by No _DaDaDaDaDaDa_ since aircraft, 4-10 and a Q-QIT. The flight was conducted at 100,000 feet, and for the first portion of the flight the landing gear was left down. After Milli became accunated to the aircraft's flight chair-activities, he raised the gear and beam a series of standard fractional residuals to test the airarri's basic aerodynamics.

After completing the flight, Milli made an intentional missed approach and wave-off, followed by a full stop landing. On landing he prepared that the aircraft has settled well as podters were encountered with the aircraft or systems. On 21 September, government and armed forces disparities from Great Britain, West Germany and Italy assembled at Manching to witness the "official" first flight of the MRCA.

On 14 August 1974, the correlated efforts of the three radios in the Panavia organization took the air as the first prototype anacle A-01 (9-650) filled out of the entrance of the 1980 right Test Centre at Manchige, West Germany, in _all_ aftershurner. With KL.N.N.

standard firing bojerning with Production Batch 3 aircraft (ZA36) onwards and is being retrofitted to earlier aircraft.

To meet RAFA register for a dedicated reconnaissance variant of the Terradoa, a standardized Terradoa GRI was modified with the two internal 2780 Master cameras employed by a horizon-a-horne Infrared Lineccen system, a Side-Locking Airborne Radar (SLAR)system and video records. The Coordinated aircraft was designated the Torradoa GRI.A and Millen externally from the GRI. In having the power requested by SLAAR windows and in the installation of a small faning board the forward hauseling for the linear lens. Terradoa GRI.A has the first reconnaissance attempt to remove such high to optical cameras, relying usually on video recorders (which can be monitored in flight). One feature-projecting performed the Terradoa GRI.A is the installation of a video data link system that will allow the Terradoa GRI.A to transmit video in real-time to a ground station. In addition to its reconnaissance capabilities, the GRI.A retains its full air-to-ground requests capability.

The first unit to reverse the GRI.A was No 13 Sigalfaro, a former Caspera scenario--an insure that the squadron was officially referred as a Terradoa unit on 13 January 1999, its 75th anniversary as an active RAF unit.

The RAF is engaged in a Torradoa mid-life update program which will include the installation of improved sensors and scientists. Ircluded in the program are the installation of a new radar system, a Forward Looking Infrared (FLIR) sensor, Night Video Google capacity, a video angle Head-Up Display (HUD) and an improved ICM suite. Some 165 aircraft are included in the update program and, upon completion, they will be redisfigured as Terradoa GRI.

Tornado GRI.1

A number of Terradoa GRI.1/IDS aircraft were built as dual control aircraft for use in polar transmitting. These aircraft are not true two seat trainer variants of the Tonado, but further fully operational CRI.105 strike irreorch with a control stick and basic high instruments bring added to the rear cockjet in addition to the normal navigator's equipment. These aircraft are designated as Terradoa GRI.118 RAF service. In the training radio, an insurestor pilot occupies the rear cockjet, while the standard pilot flies the aircraft from the front cockjet.

In the rest of an enappenings, the aircraft are fully constant capable of the full range of equipment and weapons as the Torrado GRI.105. To date, the RAF has accepted some Forty-nine GRI.11 of which carry a (T) after their serial number to denote station.

Tornado IDS

_Luftawaffe_ Service

The Laftawaffe (Western German Air Force) is the second largest operator of the Toronto IDS, after the RAF. The Laftawaffe original requirement was for 212 IDS variants, which was later increased by 228 aircraft. The Toronto was intended to replace the 430 F-104 Staffridge (Laftawaffe service, although it is unlikely that the German will replace the F-104 data on a one run basis.

Of the 228 aircraft currently on order, 175am operational plug-wavagrate arrive-crath file/huffray-end time around four minutes (although in time of war warless watch also be used for strike missions).

The Laftawaffe has three home based squadsons as well as a twenty-seven aircraft dedicated (A squadown) assigned to the TITE at RAF Conference in the United Kingdom. The German aircraft assigned to the TITE carry full Laftawley accordingly and markings as well as the letter G on the file with the aircraft's identification number.

For the five home based Toronto quadrants are in the central and southern part of the country, with one Laftawfir, RAF Germany Tienade quadrons and the Morsoftop (Mayuty) covering the northern sectors. The single northern unit is BG-38 based at lower ten to the north of the Netherlands. BG-38 has a dual role, leading as both a formulae strike squadron and as the Laftawfir-Tornado tusigatoro. The training mission involves advanced training for cross networking on the Teranda and O' or converting fone other aircraft types, such as the F-104 and F-104.

The two unusual homeI continual Germany are BG-31 based at Norternek and IBG-33 at Rueh. Both units are assigned to NATO's 2D4 Allied Tactical Air Force (LATAF). Furthersoh are included to units of Laftawfir-Tornado Hosted, IBG-344Methmring and IBG-342 at Leftawfir.

The Toronto entered service to the Laftawfir-Tornado tier 1820 and as with the RAF, a number of early octaaction aircraft used to initiate the TITE. The early examples were finished in a campaign scheme of Alf, Grobelov (Olive Green RA104) and Baselayra (Dark Gray RM1021). All 2025 supernovies over Wisalamarina (Metallic Gray RM1004) constitutes. This was later changed in a raypooned tamorphic scheme consisting of Dark Green, Medium Green, and Illus (Agnet).

Laftawfir-Tornado extended carrying the full magneto-of-standard NATO weapons in addition to a special attirum-peripheral personnel developed in Germany, the MW-1 weapons dispense. The MW-1 is basically a large container carried under the center leading station with twenty-eight individual tubes containing anti-erner/antis-personed sub-mainies (bonnich) on each side. When first, the mainstones are spread in a series of arcs either side of the inner flight. The benefits can be used to dehaute on contact or with a delayed action. The delayed action feature allows them to act as miners getting the MW-1 area itself capability.

## 6 Tornado ADV/F.2

During 190%, the British Government announced that it would develop and defying a dedicated Air Defense Warsaw (ADV) of the Tornado, with a requirement for at least 165 aircraft. These aircraft were intended to replace both the aging Lifetime first that had been in service since 1960 and the F4 Transients that have served since the end of the 1960s.

The Lightning was the fastest aircraft ever to serve with the RAF but it had one major drawback: Is there any threshold is before time was extremely limited. Additionally, it carried a somewhat out-of-dored waydown system. Its endurance could be improved by carrying serving facttrack; however, with the tanks in place, the nonrecurvibility suffered. The F4-which is without doubt the most successful control aircraft produced in the West. When this was something a safe attempt to proceed the new lightens entering service such as the F4-location and F5-15 Eagle.

When Britain announced its intention to build the Tornado ADV, the US Government offered the RAF both the F5-15 (as a reduced project) and, following the fall of the Shin of Trust, a number of F4-is-were offered at a knock down price. Both were rejected due to boost and because British in industry was occurring for unable the Tornado ADV/F2 shown as the Tornado F2 was not inoperative to take a significant amount of time.

After the engineering-box-aware we built and approach, the first prototype EA254 dedicated Air Defense Warsaw (ADV) of the Tornado, with a requirement for at least 165 aircraft. These aircraft were intended to replace both the aging Lifetime first that had been in service since 1960 and the F4 Transients that have served since the end of the 1960s.

that the RAF had to purchase a number of es-US Navy 1-4h and return No 94 Squad-roots. Additionally, because of the delay with the radar unit, the first production Terando F-2s entered service with someone habitat in the nose instead of a radar set.

The first production batch of F-2s consisted of eighteen aircraft, all but the first two being delivered to No 22s Operational Conversion Unit at Conjointly in Lincolnshire. The first two aircraft were to AWARE or farther using and development work. In the event, those warps to be the only Terando F-2b unit, since a decision had been made to re-engine the aircraft with a more powerful MK 105 engine. Of the eighteen Terando F-2ro-based, eight were configured as dual control engines.

On 10 November 1984, No 229 Operation of Coquency Unit was formed at RAF Confirtingly, with the first two Terando F-2s assigned to the unit during four days later. The F-2s were final in a low visibility overnight Light Greymonding No 220CUU using in that it was the only RAF unit to be equipped with the Terando F-2.

Originally, No 229 OUU adopted a unit before consisting of a crossed work and sound carried on the fan above the fan. Each time was marking consistent of a Red and Yellow flash on the knee. These markings were similar, but larger, to those carried by the Hasty of the Incenti Programs Unit (TWD). The CUU charged their nose markings after they were clear their waiting shadow signording kiteting.

In December 1985, the CUU was declared about ready for the emergency air defenseca, as part of his/her gas a formal infinite counterdiently (shadow identity) for use under operational circumstances. This shadow-sugderson design was notoS Squadron and accordingly newunit markings were applied to the nose of the urys F-2s. These markings comprised a Black rampant Lion in a White the finished by Red and White chetors.

Each armed with eight 1,000 pounds bends, with an additional two TOanda along an airborne spurns. Normally, the two spurns would be free to return to base once the mission commander decided of minutes aircraft would be completing the strike on the decision was made the command would release the time (usually all after the strike mission crossed the Israeli border). On this mission, the two spurns decided by some time into Iraq and to attack the so-called sistream target, rather than return to base with full bomb reads.

RAT and KEAI's Torrado F.3 were used throughout the conflict for CNP missions and as a secret for both Bernado and Ignazar strike aircraft. Reported, on one of these missions in RAT Tornado F.3 engaged and destroyed an Iraqi MG-23 Flogger.
