nicraft types to serve aboard the new carriers that were under construction. Prototypes of the Douglas TRD-1, Northrop BT-1 and Youth SR2U-1 all made their appearance during the mid-1930s. Of these two, the SB2U-1 and TBD would see combat during the early days of the Second World War.

The XSBC-1 entered into a concentrated series of tests during early 1934. The new Wright R-1820-80 air cooled radial engine gave the aircraft a top speed of 216 mph at 8,000 feet and a service ceiling of 24,000 feet. Routine testing and night flying tests, as a, now, were carried out, along with some five-following tests. Five d-wombling tests paid specific attention to the operation of the wing slots and flaps. It was during this series of tests that the XSBC-1 was lost.

On 14 June 1934, shortly before 0600, in Buffalo, New York, the XSBC-1 took off from the Curtis factory for a preliminary dive-boombing demonstration with a 500 rampout bomb being carried on the centerline bomb rack. Two views made more, with a velocity of 260 mph and the other at 290 mph. Accelerations of 4Gs were also recorded. Inspections after the flight disclosed no evidence of damage or strain on the structure. The pilot, Paul Hoyard, reported a slight buffeting of the tail, but this was not considered serious.

The XSBC-1 resumed active testing shortly after 0700. The third dive of the day was uneventful, but on the fourth dive, disaster struck the XSBC-1.

Cloud conditions were such that the dive was partly obscured from the ground. On the second dive of this flight, which was not seen by witnesses on the ground, an explosion was heard which, considered in conjunction with engine noise, indicated that the aircraft had only derived a short distance prior to being damaged. This fact was later confirmed by the pilot, who stated the incorrect that he had only entered the dive and that the speed was not yet as high as the others on the previous flight.

Paul Hoyard told the inspection that the were two explosions, one immediately after the other. He stated that the nose of the aircraft came up quickly to about horizontal and that the ASR-1 began to spin slowly in this attitude. It was at this point that the pilot excited the aircraft. He joined at about 12,000 feet and fell some distance before pulling his cryot. In the jump left of the judgment rightward a height and right leg before loading. It was determined that he was struck by the tail section after he jumped. There was a slight decoration on his signal bright which led the inspector to that conclusion. The pilot reported that the aircraft passed him and he noted that the horizontal stabilizer was folded upward alongside the vertical-The XSBC-1 on the ramp at the Curtiss factory. The aircraft retained its original BuNo, 2525, through two modification programs and three designation changes. (Curts via C. Janssen)

**The XSBC-1 crashed on 14 June 1934, after a propeller blade separated in a high speed drive. The pilot escaped with a broken arm and leg. (Thowell Aircraft Photos via Peter Bowers)**

The aircraft ensdhed in a small open spot in the town of Lancaster, New York, about six miles from the Curtiss factory. The XSBC-1 came down in a. flat attitude and pencaked into the ground. Considering the violence connected with any aircraft crash, the XSBC-1 was in remarkably good condition. The wing appearance demanded except for minor damage caused by the initial impact with the ground. The horizontal stabilizer was folded up on each side of the fuselage at angle of about forty-five degrees and the forward beam on each side was broken about six inches outboard on each side of the fuselage. Part of the engine and engine movement were torn out. The fuselage bottom was crushed upward by the impact with the ground and by the unexploded bomb.

The engine was found about one mile from the aircraft. One propeller blade and hub were still with the engine. The other blade was found about two miles from where the engine landed and had broken off in the hub. The pilot tended about three miles from the aircraft, with his parachate, and was taken to Millard Fillmore Hospital in Buffalo by ambulance. The cause of the crash was determined to be the failure of a propeller blade, which led to gel, followed immediately by engine and the breaking of the horizontal stabilizer from excessive vibration. The XSBC-1, two-event soon bounce, was gone forever.

On 6 July 1934, Curtis regulated BuAer regarding the construction of a replacement aircraft for the XSBC-1. This proposal eliminated the folding wings and called for a complete redesign of the fuselage structure to provide for full metal monocooco construction in lie of the previous combination of welded tubular steel and metal monocooco. An improvement in the cabin structure of the cockpits was proposed, including the installation of a streamlined rear folding turblocked section.

Unlike the XSBC-1, the replacement would be a biplane and the single spur upper wing would not have leading edge slots, but the lower wing would be fitted with full span flaps. The new aircraft would be powered by a 700 hp Wright XR-1510-12 air-cooled radial engine, driving a three blade propeller.

BuAer approved the proposal and gave the new aircraft the designation XSBC-2, although the original BuA925, was resuspended to the replacement. The XSBC-2 made is first flight on 9 December 1935, and a few months later it was re-engited with a Pratt & Whitney R-1535-82 engine since the original Wright engine had proven to be mechanically unreliable. As a result of the engine change, the prototype underwent still under designation change, this time to XSBC-3. With the new engine, BuAer awarded Curtiss a 2,045,783 dollar production contract for eighty-three aircraft under the designation SBC-3.

## Sbc-3

The SBC-3 differed very little from the prototype. Production aircraft were powered by a slightly more powerful engine, the Pratt & Whitney R-1535-04 at-cooked radial driving a three blade Hamilton Standard propeller. The two place aircraft had the crew seated under a sliding canopy with separate sliding sections for each crew member. The rear observer/genwar was equipped with a single 3.00 chiller machine gun, which was stowed under the folding under deck when not in use. The main landing gear retracted into wells in the forward feses-large, while the tail wheel semi-retracted into a well at the tail, being partially exposed when retracted. The feselage was all metal, while the wings were metal with finite covering, connected by 1st Ytrus. The upper wing outer panels were swept back at a slight angle and included the alternons. The lower wing included the full span flaps which were used both for landing and as drive brakes during dive-bombing operations. The pilot was provided a single 3.00 caltsber machine gun mounted in the stabroat forward feselage. A single 500 pound bomb could be carried on the lower feselage centriche suspended from a bomb displacement swing. For the long range missions, a forty-five gallop drone would be carried in place of the bomb.

During this time period, Bauer had only awarded production contracts for monoplamine aircraft, the exception being the SBC-3. Because of this, and the acceptance of the XSBC-4 in January of 1938, the SBC design would carry on well past our entry into the Second World War with frontline service on USIS RDREST and with the Marine Corps on Sonato.

The early competitors of the AF12C-1, the Douglas XPH-2 and the Vough XPH-1-1 were not awarded contracts by Bauer, although the Vough design was modified in February of 1934 and became the XSBL+1, which later went into production as the SBU-1 and equipped Scouting Squadron One B (VS-IS) and Secuting Squadron For-two (VS-42) on USS RANGEX CV-4, during 1936 and 1937 respectively.

The Curtis XSBC-4 started out as the seventy-sixth production SBC-3. Curtis began the modification to the basic airframe in February of 1938. The biggest change was the installation of a more powerful and larger diameter 500 by Wright R-1820-22 air-cooled radial. The new engine led to a modification of the cowling and forward feasible to accommodate the larger diameter of the Curtis power plant. With the more powerful engine, the aircraft was able to carry a larger bomb load, up to 1,000 pounds, on the centerline bomb track. The forward firing ramament was also changed from a single 3.0 caliber machine gun to a single.50 caliber machine gun.

The aircraft was accepted by the Navy almost immediately. BuAr issued a contract for fifty-eight aircraft under the designation SBC-4 (Bakos 1268-1235) of a January 1938. On July 24 by a second contract was issued for another thirty-five Quos 1474-501. This was followed in 3 August by a third contract for thirty-five additional aircraft (Bakos 1809-1843).

In a move designed to upgrade the aircraft being bony by Scotting Squadron from VVS-2 on USS LEXINGTON, it was decided that they would be the first unit to take delivery of the new SBC-4. Souring two had been flying the Vought SBU-1 event like-1935 when they were designated VS-3B and equipped with a combination of Grunnian SE-1s and Vought SBUs.

The first SBC-4 off the production line went to NAS Ancuois, outside Washington, D.C. where it was put through a series of tests and an experimental program.

The French Connection

By mid-B404, the situation in France had deteriorated to such a point that the nation would fall to the Germans at any time. Earlier, during 1999, the Aeronavide had ordered ninety Curtis Model 77s, the export variant of the SDC4. The Model 77 was the same as a SDC4 with minor modifications to meet French requirements, The 50 collider machine guns were replaced by Darme 7.70ad machine runs and space was provided for the French Type B part-cube. Production of these aircraft was progressing slowly, since production of the Curtis Hawk 75 and Hawk 81 figures had priority at the Curtiss factory. Near the end of May 1940, acting on an urgent request from the French government, the White House authorized the effect of HyS V. Navy Space-4s of the Naval Reserve. In turn, the Navy would replace the SDC4s with aircraft from the original French contract as they became available.

So the notes we used 6 June 1940, to simulate the firefly SBC4s from the various NARBs around the country and refer them to Buffalo, New York. Not only were fifty SSCs being set to France, but so were ten spare R-1820-34 engines, twelve spare groupings and other structural spare parts.

The aircraft were transferred from the Navy to the War Department and their journeys began. The following aircraft were selected for transfer. Buskos 1399,1303,1311,1503,1383, 1839, 1840 and 1841 from Rahmac Aussia, Washington, D.C. Buskos 1813, 1825,1826, 1827, 1841, 1815, 1835, 1836 and 1837 from NRB Archosville, New York. Buskos 1308, 1474, 1475, 1476, 1489, 1490 and 1491 from NRB Graphics, Illinois, Buskos 1307, 1486 and 1487 from NRB St. Louis, Missouri. Buskos 1477, 1479, 1492, 1493, 1494, 1828 and 1503 from NRB Kansas City, Missouri. Buskos 1480, 1481, 1482, 1489, 1480, 1820 and 1821 of MSAB Minneapolis, Minnesota. Airport.

The NX-C27 was a temporary orbit registration applied for delivery to the French and all the aircraft the IMC-C code. (E. Dolgan via Peter Bowers)

### Returning, Massachusetts.

Of the fifty, nineteen held less than fifty hours of flight time on the airframe and engine. At the date of transfer, one had only 7.7 hours and twenty-seven had less than 10 hours of flight to blow out of flight.

All of the SDC4s that had been earmarked for France were to proceed at once to the Curtiss factory in Buffalo, New York. Once at Curtis, the SDC4s were immediately prepared for the French. The Dame machine guns were installed in place of our bombings, and in shipping markets that would limit the aircraft to US were removed. The colorful Navy paint centres were replaced by a French caroding scheme and the radders were reprinted with the French tri-color water stripes. The Curtis employees worked long and hard to get the job done as quickly as possible.

Gradually all fifty traveled Buffalo and the pilots were given their instructions. For the forty flight, the pilots would become Curtis employees and be paid S250, 00 plus rail far back to Buffalo from Hultzura, Nova Scotia. Like the SBC-4s they would have to remove anything from their personal efforts that would identify them as US. Naval personnel.

The pilots were by ten in sections of three, whenever three aircraft were ready to go. The plan was to leave Buffalo, by to Buffalo, Vermont, from no Augusta, Maine then to Houston, Maine and finally to Hultzura, Nova Scotia. That was the plan, however, because of the idiosyncrasies of international politics, when the aircraft reached the US.C./Canadian border, the pilots were not allowed to fly them over the border. To get around this technically, the pilots landed at the border crossing at Houlton, and there automobiles and factors were used to tow the SDC4s across the border in New Brunswick. This method of border crossing was necessary to meet the requirements of U. S. neutrality laws in the effect. Once over the border, the pilots had to take off from a nearby pasture, then it was on to Hultzura where the French restart carrier BEARN wasited to transport the SDC4s to France. The SDC4s were loaded aboard the BEARN which set to sea on 16 June 1940, scorted by the French carrier, JEANNED'DARC. The two ships are set for France, but while at sea, France expininled to Germany and the little Hotilla turned south toward the French West lies slind of Martinique. On this Caribbean island the highly prepared bijnuses were off-loaded and Ihmed up nose to tail, wing to wing, with canvas coverings over the engines and cockpit capsules.

Samo's air defense consisted of VMF-111 with innocent Fif-4 Wildcasts and VMO-151-view bsec-4. For a short time both squadres shared the facilities with Scouting Squadron One, Fourteenth Naval District's U-104D and their street Venough G3012S, V3-15-114D and arrived in Samano on 23 January 1942. This way squadron with his OS25G, Grumman f275-5, eight eight officers and sixty-eight enlisted men were reassigned 100 miles northwest of Samano to base, Stapapusta, on the British Samano island of Upou some thirty days after the arrival of VMO-151 at Turkish.

Typical of the pilots flying with VMO-151 was Colonel John B. Bertening, USMC, Ret. He recalled it this way, "I have checked my log book, covering the period 25 May, when I had my first flight in a SBC-4 to 8 December 1942, for a total of about 298.8 hours, logged to twenty-two different SBC-4s, which is about all the aircraft the squadron had that the time of this total, 1932 hours were recorded as patrols for every patrol. We had an alert crew of six pilots and six gunners who remained on duty from dawn to dusk every 2. I believe these are the ones who fleve the anti-subrinature patrols around the islands. With this as a constant, there were not many aircraft of flight laws available for training. Maintenance was a real problem, since my log book shows that I fleve a number of patrols and some conveyors as to the optimum IBF-5 Duck. Some narrows should to protect the engine, and a new pilot's seat was installed, made of armor plane. This made the seat very heavy but they did not **3-B-11 rests on a work stand after a landing accident at Naval Air Station North Island, San Diego, California.

change the bunge costs in the mechanism for adjusting the height of the seat. As a consequence, if you tried to adjust your seat in flight, it was likely to fall to the bottom, and you could proved yes out of the cockpit. And it was too heavy to raise without help. Beautiful design. It made landing at hit laying.

The War Plan to repel the expected Japanese attack was not particularly orthodox. We assumed that the approach of the Japanese invasion for force would be detected and shadowed by U.S. submarines. When the force was within range, not radius, of the SBC-4, we would launch all available aircraft, and fly out to the attack. Obviously, on the right flight, the SBCs would not put off us and go as ditch in the ocean. Then, the commanding cereal's P57-5A would lead in the water and pick up the crews. \(\Gamma\)m not sure if the plan could for an open ocean take-off, but it certainly was not the sort of plan that inspired confidence in our survival.

At this time the unit was commanded by Captain James L. Neefus, who had been a division leader in VMF-221 flying Brewester F2A-3s from Midway Island on 10 March 1942. He and three other Marine fighter pilots caught a Japanese Emily flying boat and shot it down. He received the Navy Cross for this mission.
