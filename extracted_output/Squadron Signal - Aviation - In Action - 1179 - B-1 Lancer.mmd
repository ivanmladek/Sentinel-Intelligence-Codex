## Development

B-1A Number One

**B-1A Number Four (With 'Crosseye' ECM Spine)**

**B-1B Lancer**B-1A

Rockwell unveiled the B-1A full-scale mockup on 4 November 1971. A critical review of the mockup by Air Force officials resulted in 297 requests for changes. This was an indication of how complex the B-1 had become. Before the first aircraft there, 22,000 hours of wind tunnel time had been expended to refine the airframe design. The B-1 employed a swing-wing to ensure performance at either end of the operational envelope. The sim baseline headed into one-shot moving steps, augmenting hit all speeds while variable energy using fewer than 15\(\%\)(attended) reduced for two speed flight to 67.5 (fully swept after) for high speed flight. They are equipped with full span stats, which can be extended 20 for taxed and landing, and lasted flung, which can be extended up to 40.7. The extension is allowed to sweep angles of 15 to 20. Beyond 20,70 variables intervals prevent of flops and slats. The B-1 has no airless; it is controlled by upper wing spoilers and typfferent movement the subhalutes.

Long life was always a major consideration when designing the B-1. This led Rockwell to employ advanced fracture mechanics to select optimum metals for the airframe. Fracture mechanics enabled the Rockwell engineers to predict which components were most susceptible to failure before their predicted life. According to Robert E. Greer, president of Rockwell's 19-1 Division at the time: _The basic assumption in all fracture analysis is that cracks or cracks-like fans can exist in all internal components, and that they may grow due to load applications encountered in service. Our job has been to test thousands of combinations of metals to select exactly the right ends to use in the numerous fracture critical areas of the B-1, such as the wide variety-through structure, the supporting start for the horizontal and vertical stabilizers and the tension stays on the wings._

One of the most critical components of the B-1 is the wing carry-through structure, which connects the outer wings with their pivots. The carry-through must be tough enough to withstand the rigors of the wing sweep operation, while allowing the B-1 to operate at high speed and low altitude, where the Q (dynamic pressure) factors are high. The carry-through uses diffusion bonded 6A-4V titanium alloy. This same material is also used for the wing pivot mechanism and the pivot pins. Titanium comprises 21 percent of the B-1 airframe. The sweep mechanism is activated by hydentially operated screwisks, with asymmetric movement previously to a torus shaft between the two screwisks.

The B-1A had a wingwigton of 136 feet S 5 inches (41.7 x0) fully extended and 78 feet 2.5 inch-(23 s) slab w/s range atht. The aircraft was 143 feet 3.5 inches (43.7 x0) long, not interling the 6 for 161 inch (21.2 x0) loss region mounted on the nose of the first two B-1A-S. The B-1A 330 33 feet 2.75 inches (10.2 x0) full.

The B-1A carried 15000 pounds (80.804) occurred from initial tensile: two in the wings and six in the fresher. There is no accommodation for external leaf carriage. Weapons are carried in three 15 feet (4.6 x0) long, two in front of the wing carry-through, and one out. Each one on accommodate approximately 25,000 pounds (11,340) for a variety of nuclear and conventional ordinance. The empty weight of B-1A was 140,000 pounds (63.504 x00), with a roughs of 360,000 pounds (163,296).

The aircraft was apparently powered by 70,000 pounds that General Electric YF101-GE-100 turbine engines with afterburning. These powerplants allowed the B-1A to reach a maximum of 130 with 225.89 m, or about 22.22, or about 5,000 feet (15.240 x0) altitude. For men weed the aircraft. Pilot, Co-Pilot, Defensive Systems Officer (ISO), and Offensive Systems Officer (ISO). The B-1A's unrestricted range was 6100 times (9816.7). A serious problem for drivers is the rough faceountered at low altitude, due to constant turbulence. This can lead to fatigue and degraded crew performance on long legs at the B-1A's expected penetration altitudes. This is accentuated in an aircraft such as the B-1, with the crew sitting for forward the Center of Gravity (CG). To damp this effect, the B-1A was equipped with a Rockwell developed Low Altitude Ride Control (LARC) system - later renamed the Structural Mode Control System (SMCS). It is a derivation of two 'exicter vanes'that were mounted on the SB-70 research aircraft. SMCS uses two downward-canted vanes mounted on the aircraft's nose, which are activated by motion sensors in the fuselage. These sensors note accelerations in the airframe and move to dang out motions throughout all axis.

The first B-1A (event number 74-0158) rolled out of Air Force Plant 42 in Palmdale, California on 26 October 1974. It has first flight on 23 December 1974, with Rockwell test pilot Chair C. Beck, Jr. in the left set, Colonel Emil 74: Suremhall 8-cpolat, and Richard Abrams as engineer. The flight delivered 74-0158 to Edwards at Force Base (AEP), and California for the start of flight testing. The number three aircraft (74-0160), configured as the avionics test bed, made its first flight on 26 March 1976. The number two aircraft (74-0159) was initially used as a static structural test article and did not fly until 14 June 1976. Because the political winds of change were switing around the program in the 1970s, the number four aircraft did not fly until 14 February 1979.

The B-1 team was continuously optimistic when they began the formal flight test program in January of 1975. The only aircraft they would have for most of that year was the number one aircraft, so they proceeded carefully. The test program proceeded through 1975 and the 1976, while political trouble between the person of Jimmy Carter. The Georgia governor won the Democratic nomination for president and then won the preselative in November of 1976, based in large part on promises to overall government, including the defense contracting process. During his campaigns, Carter had referred to the B-1 as _"a wast pregnant"_.

Although Rockwell was awarded a production contract for the model airframes December of 1976, this was followed by a static argument within the new administration over a full production decision for the now controversial brother. USAF and Rockwell officials were specified that the new president would change his mind when confronted with the full real-precision build on the **B-1 prototype**.

**The B-1 prototype is pulled out of the Palmadle factory. The first flight occurred from Palmadle on 23 December 1974. Two years of testing followed the initial flight in anticipation of a production decision in late 1975. The first B-1 was deselected to Triping qualities testing. It was the first B-1 to reach Mach 2, achieving this milestone in April of 1976. (Rocketwell)**

In addition of the Soviet threat that is afforded to the chief executive. In fact, they prepared for the President's B-1 news conference by having B-1 press kits on hand for attending journals. The announcement was made on 30 June 1977. Carter said: "My decision is that we should not continue with the deployment of the B-1, and I am directing that we discourine plans for decision..." Secretary of Defense Hardware Hardware has actually agreed in favor of the B-1, but were along with the President's politically motivated decision to cancel the aircraft. (Carter had made cancellation of the B-1 campaign since).

While he killed the B-1 production program, Carter allowed the testing and development program to continue. This was not much of a safe to the expectation of a production contract, which was to have totaled 24 aircraft, involving dozens of companies across the nation. It did keep open the possibility of a future production contract, should the alternative plan of improving B-52s and building wide-body cruise missile launches prove insufficient to deal with potential threats. Rockwell immediately announced that it would lay off 16,000 workers, and Rockwell stock lost over 10% of its value before trading was halted.

The last of the four prototype aircraft (76-0174) made its first flight on 14 February 1979. It had entered prediction before the farefall cancellation, and took four years to complete. The four prototypes accumulated almost 1000 hours of testing flight time before the 30 April 1981.

After completion of the test program. While the test program was progressing, the Air Force continued to study possible replacements for its aging fleet of B-52s. The mission of a proposed follow-on-border had evolved into more than that of cruise missile launches or free-fall market bomher. A multi-mission capable bomber was specified and on 2 October 1981, President Ronald Regan announced that Rockwell would be awarded a contract to build 100-218 bottles.

B-1A Crew Capsule

A General Electric (GE) technician examines the first TF101 afterburning turbofan engine. The USAF selected this engine as the B-1A was powerful in June of 1970. The TF101 enginerad 29.850 pounds of thrust in afterburning. The similar F101-GE-42 engine powering the later B-1B (Lunar) is rated at 38.200 pounds in afterburning. GE received a contract for 428 F101-G12 engines in 1982. (General Electric).

B-1A number one is parked on the ramp at Edwards AFB, California during the flight test program. Stabilizing years' for the crew escape capsule are extended, permitting access to the central vortices compartment. These vances automatically extended when the capsule was ejected. (Lyary Davis).

The first B-1A (74-0158) fleve profiles at 200 feet (60.96 au) above the ground during Terrain Following Radar (TF101), A Texas Instruments ANAPO-146 TF - also used on the General Dynamics F-111F - was installed on B-1A. The General Electric ANAPO-144 was the B-1A's main forward-looking radar. (USAF).

The third and fourth B-1A's were modified with a dorsal spine in 1980. This spine contained the waveguide for the Kunsz-Afterman "Crossley" Electronic Commensences (ICM) system. Both aircraft were painted in desert camouplings: Tan (P330400), Green (P33420), and Brown (P330219), with Gloss White undersurfaces. The third B-1A (74-016) retained the blackordon. (USAF).

B-1B Lancer

The decision to produce the B-1B was part of President Reagan's defense beloitability initiative and a campaign promise. We now know that this program sounded the death law fit the Soviet Union and ended a 40 year cold war; however, it was little understood at the time. A national news magazine cited the _"infinfluence"S1.5 million car"_ of the buildup, and was surprised that it was going ahead _"without any clear strategy."_ They also questioned whether the defense industry would be able to _"deliver the new weapon or time and within budget."_ The B-1B portion of the proposed ball was quoted at 52.4 billion. Initial B-1B neutron. That B-1B neutron have been to 20 January 1982; 51.3 billion for the aircrists will scale development and SSRC.

In fact, for totaling and production of the first B-1B. However this year the go-ahead and their B-1B program and underway almost immediately, benefiting from the 56 billion rediscovery spent on study and testing. General Electric was also awarded contracts for producing 34,000 found them B1B-G2-G2 engines for this aircraft. There were 3000 sub-contractors involved in these contracts, and it was estimated that S8,000 s bowds be generated, including 22,000 at Rockwell.

The B-1B differed from the B-1A in several respects, The Radar Cross Section (RCS) was decreased by over 85% through engine inlet redesign. The change in the B-1's mission from high altitude penetration to low altitude had eliminated the Mach 2's speed requirement. This allowed a simplified intake design, eliminating the movable airr ranges used on B-1A intakes. RCS vases placed within the infers shield the engine faces from radar returns. The B-1B RCS vols only 7.4 (7.5 s, Rt.) has thus not been created by the B-52 s 70 s\({}^{2}\) (75.5 s, Rt.).

**A B-1B test arteries (see various California, accompanied by a cellular contract). T-38 Talon (0838TC). The Lancer is finished in the Strategic Scheme of Dark Gunnity (P380601), Dark Green (P384068), and Medium Gunnity Gray (P384101). The B-1 Combined Test Force (CIF) at Edwards are also used F-111, F-160, F-4, and F-15 Chase afterant during the B-1B testing and service acceptance fragments. (USAAF)**

RCS. Simplified engine intakes reduced the B-1B's maximum speed from 1300 MW (2236.9 xan0), or Mach 2.22, to 792 awt (1274.6 sanol), or Mach 1.25, at 50.000 feet (152.40 s).

The B-1A's pointed nose radome was replaced by an ogular radiome on the B-1B. A Westinghouse (now Northrop Gumman) AN/P6-164 annual-mode defensive array was fitted for navigation and terrain following use. This Synthetic: Aperture Radar (SAR) enables B-1B creaves to see their targets through heavy weather conditions. The crew escape module of the first three B-1A was eliminated (beginning with the fourth B-1A) in favor of conventional ACES (Advanced Concept Section) I elevation Series. The four-arm crew - pilot, or Pilo, Offensive Systems Officer (OSO), and Defensive Systems Officer (OSO) - was unchanged from the earlier B-1A. The B-1B OSO and DSO reach a small window on the offense side, of the windshield. These windows were not installed on B-1A. The new veracity variant has a more aerodynamic covering faring, which completely sealed the gap between the swept system into scientific and its strategic. Fudge-corrother arbiter was best the gaps between the wing sections and the upper and lower faring surfaces. The all fusefee was employed to accommodate increased defensive avorioriies. The B-1A's pointed (unco anchor-inordual stabilized firing were changed on B-1B-1B to those with a blutter, which allowed more volume for electronic equipment.

External dimensions for the B-1B are identical to the earlier B-1A. The wingspan is 136 feet 8.5 inches (41.7 s) fully extended (15 "s" sweep angle) and 78 feet 2.5 inches (23.8 s) at full air shower (67.5). Please length is 143 fG 3.5 inches (47.3) and aircraft length is 3367.2 inches (10.2). After strengthening for the low-level operation twice decreased by the B-1B's raungship with 140000 pounds (63.046 xv) was increased by 192,000 pounds (87.9210 zx) of the B-1B. The gross stock valued West has increased from 360,000 pounds (163.296 xv) in the B-1A to 477,000 pounds (216.367 zx).

The second and fourth B-1A flight after aircraft (40.749 and 76.0174) were modified to B-1B standard. The first flight of 74.05 in the new configuration - although retaining the crew escape module - was from Edwards AFB on 23 March 1983. The fourth B-1A (76.0174) made is first flight in B-1B mode on 30 July 1984, carrying the full suite of B-1B offensive and defensive avoriies. This aircraft flew in the B-1B test program until 31 October 1985.

One of the most critical aspects of the B-1 flight envelope is fuel load management. Fuel is distributed in six tanks located throughout the fusepiage and one tank in each outer wing. Coupled with the ability to swing the wings, this can result in a radical shift in the Center of Gravity (CG), Production aircraft use fuel management computers to ensure the CG remains within limits. During a low speed handling test by the second B-A on 29 August 1984, the schedule called for crew crew needs to manage this task. After completing the first part of the test with the wings swept to 55deg and the manual CG set at 45%, the aircraft was Accelerated and wings swept forward. With the road fans down, the test called for CG of 27% at 138 knots (158.9 nm/257.5 km). The crew failed to initiate fuel transfer and the CG remained at 45%. At 145 knots (167 \(\mu\)m/268.7 km), the aircraft pitched up and apparently stalled, rolling to the right. Recovery attempts were made for the following 30 seconds before the crew pulled the ejection headle and the crew escape needle front. The aircraft impacted the ground the second late. Unfortunately, the crew escape module did not function properly and Rockwell Chief Test Pilot T.D. Benedettlad was killed. Major Richard Reynolds Capto Ohio Wanicker were injured.

The first motion p-B (8-2000) rolled out of Rockwell's Palindle plant fire months ahead of schedule, on September 1984, and made its first flight on 18 October. The first operational B-B (named _The Star of Albacher_) was delivered to the Right Bombardment Wing. Heavy (ONW) A Dress A/P, Anker Abitnene, and C27 June 1995. The B-1B achieved Oriental Capatility (ICC) in July of 1986 and stood its first nuclear alert the following 1 October. The final production aircraft was delivered in the Air Force In May 1988, still schedule and another place. The UAST officially christened the B-B in the Lancer on 15 March 1990. Like most official names, the people who maintain and fly the B-B have largely ignored 1. They prefer the risk became "Bose" (from B-Oek).

Lancers were originally delivered to four BMWs (Bomb Wings, BWs, from 1 October 1991); The Both BMW at Dress A/P, the 28th BMW at Ellworth AFB, South Dakota; the 38th BMW at McCourtell APE, Kansas; and the 31th BMW at Grand Forks AFB, North Dakota.

The **10th and final B-B (06-0140) is asentied at Palindle. The Eaton ANA/L61A Electronic Countermeasures System (ECMS) is installed at the vertical in the rear. Navigation lights are mounted under the antenna. The Lancer'suder is divided into three sections, whose lower section has not yet been installed. This section is linked to the Structural Mode Control System (SNICS), working in conjunction with nose-mounted vanes to damp out airframe fleving in rough air. (Rockwell)**

The first B-1B (82-0001) taxies in takeoff configuration, with its hydraulically operated slats and flaps deployed to improve lift. Seven section leading edge stats extend first - down 20 - and retract last. The six section Fowler type trailing edge flaps have a maximum deployment angle of 40. Failings on the horizontal stabilizer tips contained hutter bands not seen on other production 'Boens.' These wands collected information on the stabilize's tip excursions (vertical flexing). (Recoverl)

The soldiers are deployed to the full 70' upward deflection on this 'Boens' parked at Dress AFL, Texas. Spokers are used to kill tilt on landing and for sub-sonic control control in the air. All four soldiers on each wing act as speed brakes on ground, but only the two highest soldiers per wing operate while airborne. B- horizontal stabilites operate collectively (+1/-25/ 10% pitch control, and differently (+20) for roll control. (Lou Drende)

The B-1B nose landing gear can be steered 75 to port or sturbard for directional control on the ground. The system is hydraulically operated and electronically controlled, with commands sent through the rudder pedulas. Noise wheel steering is automatically disengaged when the landing gear is retracted. The landing gear tracks is 14 feet 6 inches (4.4 s) and the wheelbase is 57 feet 6 inches (17.5 s). (Blockwell)
The B-1B front cabin's center overhead panels includes the All Retaining Control Panel, Auxiliary Power Unit (APU) Control and Indicator Panel, Electrical Power Control Panels, Main Lightting Control Panel, and Corey Computernent Pressure Alliance. A standboxy compass is mounted at the vertical panel's center section, between the two air events. Basic interior colors are Dark Gulf Gray (FS36231) and Instrument Black (FS27038, (Lou Dends))The B-1B's nose landing gear is similar to the earlier 9-1A gear, although strengthened to handle increased aircraft weights. The drag link extending from the forward gear by the main start is shorter on the B-1B. The nose gear retracts forward and upward into the fuselage, with emergency gear extension aided by the slipstream. The crew access hatch and retracting ladder is deployed at of the nose gear struct.

B-1B Weapons

Although it was conceived as a long-range strategic nuclear bomber, the B-1 has evolved into a conventional attack platform. The Lancer can be turned with a wide variety of bombs, missiles, and mines. It can carry 75.000 pounds (34,020 x0) of ordinance internally in three weapons bays. The 'Bone' can also carry 59.000 pounds (26,762.4 x0) of extremally-mounted weapons. External nations were designed for launching Boeing **AGAG-86N Z Launched Cruise Missiles (ALCMs)** and have not been used operationally. Their use is problematic, since they had significantly to the B-1B's Radar Cross Section (RCS), thereby removing one of its primary defense features.

The B-1's stated _ration of three_ (reason for being) was deep penetration of the enemy landfill which accelerates weapons. Compatibility testing was conducted from 1983 to 1980, with the B-19 eventually confined to ApJ **261** and **883** priority nuclear bombs and Leibendorf **AG-69A Short Range Attack Missiles (SRAMs)**. Eight B61s, B83, or AG-69A wase loaded in each weapons up on a Muti-Purpose Radar Counter (MPFLA). The USafety decided to restrict the B-1B to delivery of conventional weapons in 1991. In spite, the Russians were allowed to inspect all Launcers to verify that the nuclear delivery capability had been removed to comply with treaty obligations. A smart control limits have resulted in the multi-part Conventional Mission Upgrade Program (CMPU), which transformed the Lancer into a conventional-only bother since line 1997.

The most popular conventional weapons load is eighty-four 500 pomed (226.8 x0) Mx **8** hours, which has 28 bombs carried per weapons by on a Conventional Weapons Module (CWM). The 88.32 is a free-fall 'down' bomb, with the different first seals available: 'Skile' (0x-0x2) conical fins, and the B-US4-9 Air Infulatable Reactor (AIR). The BSU-49 48 hils are high drag or drag one, either as which can be used in flight by the Offensive Systems Officer (OSO). Mx 82s use either proximity (raday or mechanical fishing. This was the only non-nuclear bomb certified for one on the B-1B until 1995. The 28th Bon

B-1B at War

_War is a "continuation of political intercourse by other means."__**Karl von Clausweit**_

Bill Clinton was one of the most political of all US presidents. Despite his professed distaste for the military and the use of force, he was far from reluctant to use the military for a variety of political reasons. Irajar Sadman Hussein was a most cooperative querier, due to his continued disregard for the agreements reached at the end of the 1991 Gulf War. His program to develop weapons of mass destruction was kept out of the puriety of United Nations investors. When the most vocal of these investors was expelled from the country, Clinton seized upon the opportunity to divert attention from his own political problems.

Operation DESERT FOX (December of 1998)

On December 16, 1998, United States Central Command (USCENTCOM) military forces launched cruise missile attacks against military targets in 12m. These strikes were ordered by the President of the United States and were undertaken in response to rays continued failure to comply with United Nations Security Council resolutions as well as their interference with United Nations Special Commission (UNSCO) inspectors. The strikes were designed to deliver a serious blow to Sadman Hussein's capability to manufacture, store, maintain and deliver weapons of mass destruction and his ability to threaten or otherwise intimidate his neighbors.

DESERT RX was the B-1's combat table. It would be followed within a few months by a more extensive employment of the 'Bone' in combat over Kosovo, one of the provinces of the former Yugoslavia.

The collapse of the Soviet Union in the early 1990s created many political vacuums in several former Eastern Bose countries. The former Yugoslavia reverted to increase warfare between provinces with long-standing political, religious, and ethnic provinces against one another.

The Kosovo crisis started in early 1998 with fighting between regional factors and the Sethomized army of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. The widespread and vicious battles resulted in the displacement of over 300,000 people. Despite agreement on a case-free in October of 1998, fighting contained the situation worsened in early 1999. Diplomatic efforts to end the war continued with a Paris Pace Conference, which ended in March with-out agreement on a peaceful solution.

Operation ALLIED FORCE was a North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) response with the stated objectives of ensuring toll compliance with US Security Council Resolution 1199 (23 September 1998). Operation NONE ANN, until as the American component of this NATO action and began on 19 March 1998. Unlike Operation DESERT STORM, which was a textbook application of airpower that quickly achieved the objectives of degrading the enemy, ALLIED FORCE revived to the Vietnam strategy of graduated pressure. Predictually, ALLIED FORCE failed to discourage the Serbian Army and thousands of additional ethnic Albaines and Kossova died for oversized before NATO shifted its focus from tactical targets to strategic targets. The latter targets included command and control facilities in the Yugoslavia capital, Belgrade.

In DESERT STORM, coalition forces fleew 400,000 strike series') in 30 days. In ALLIED FORCE, NATO type 8000 series in 78 days. Precision-Guided Mountains (ORGs, or smart homes, comprised of the boroughs dropped in ALLIED FORCE. B-528 and B-Is dropped the remaining 30% of boroughs expanded during this campaign. Although only four B-Is were tasked at any one time, they dered 45% of the gravity or 'dumb' bends, all of which were 500 round (2268.6 sec) MK 82 weapons.

Six B-1s from the 77th Bond Squadron (BS) and two from the 37th B-S - both of the 28th Bomb Bomb from fellowwork AP, South Dakota - were assigned to the 100th Air Expeditionary Wing at Royal Air Force (RAF) Fairfool, England. They shared the issue with 18 B-52 bomers from 2nd and 5th Bond Wings. Prior to their deployment, there was some consideration given to flying the unions from Elkworthy. These would have been 30-hour missions, events to the 7-hour mission time from Fairfool. Ultimately, the convenience of home basins was overcome by the fatigue of 30-hour missions.

Carpain Jeff Warnaka is a 1992 graduate of the US Air Force Academy. His first operational assignment was to the B-1 joining the 37th BS as Ellkworth AFB in 1996. When the 77th BS was reactivated in 1997, left transferred from the 37th to the 77th.

He was at the forefront of the deployment for ALLIED FORCE, leaving Ellkworth for RAF Fairfool on 31 March 1999. The first B-1 missions were flown on 1 April, During MOBIE, ANVIL, the American segment of ALLIED FORCE, Jeff five 17 counters.' (Combat missions were only counted if the flight reached the Adriatic Sea. Several missions were recalled, for a variety of reasons, prior to reaching this benchmark.) He had been flying missions for a mention when he was assigned to what would become his most memorable mission of the deployment.

The Novi Sad petroleum production facility in northern Yugoslavia was a vital producer of led for the Serbian war machine. This made it a high value strategic target, but the initial objectives of ALLED FORCE were limited to the destruction of tactical targets. When it became apparent that tactical warfare alone was not going to stop Sestain aggression, the target just was expanded to include infrastructure like Noyoi Sako, which was a perfect target for area bombing. No other aircraft in the inventory could fly an area bombing mission like the B-1, so the 77th spot the assignment in May 1999. This is f'est recollection of that mission, which proved to be more exciting than most:

_"Our target operational was standard, which meant an afternoon show [brief] at the operational building, where the mission planning cell had worked on everything and parts must be the plan together while we were in crew. They decided as on the mission space after we spent some time receiving the paperwork." The package was comprehensible and included ingress and regress routes, [and] of the Air Taking Order (ATO), which included everyone who would be flying their night."_

**Integrated Air Defense is a well-run most that applies to a network of enemy anti-arcin weapons. It was the way the Allies went about attacking Kosovo. Attack packages consisted of fighter bombers - on-from been several different air arms - "With Wasser' HAM showers, jamming platforms, air-to-air Combt Air Patrol (CAP) figures, AWACS, and makers in addition to the nearby bombers.**

**Out a few of the wires were scheduled to hit their targets before us. This was due to the fact that after we hit the target, it would be pretty much obscured in dust, flames and smoke from our combined load of 168 MHz 820 500 pounds. Most of our six packages consult: "On the existing market," _Patch of all of any stations were born apart of a combined package._

_"From an historical standpoint, Nori Sad was a good number larger. It was a large production facility, with good radar definition. We were able to drag an 1800-foot [548.6 \(\pm\) 8] long string of bombas across the target and have virtually every one of the bomba but something worthwhile. Though all had been a couple of the high intensity, it was still operating. Our plan was to flow through the target, then turn north so _two_ taming target : yet _if not of any_ networks which had not come out of the Nori Sad run. The mission planning cell had done a good job on the package, and we were confident as we stepped out to the jet in the late afternoon soon._

_It was still daylight when we took off into a clear market. The climb out was unserversd and before the first two sun was, and it was so bright that we could see that Linda Abs with the rule of the Night Vision Geogels that were on every mission. We created Italy and pushed into the Adriatic. The radius were busy, like they were on most nights, and there was some initial confusion about the frequency we were supposed to work, but AWACS eventually straightened it out and we checked in with the F-16 SED (Suppression of enemy Air Defenses) High. We marshalled to the west of the target, and when the package was together, we had for the IP [Initial] Paidi._

_"The weather was good, but just a few commulas [dense while] cloud over the target, and we could see the target from a long ways out, As we approached the IP, we began to pick up some AOA [Anti-Aircraft Artillery]. It seemed close, but was well below us. The F-16s [77b] BS 9-18 (95-0091) is parked at Ellsworth AFB in August of 1999, following combat over Yugoslavia. The "Bones" flow during Operation ALLED FORCE were the first Lamers equipped with the Towed Deep System (TOS) on the tail cone sites. The TOS employs the ALL-550 radio frequency repeater jammer against enemy missiles aimed at the B-1. (Luo Dened)

"_Everyone in the package wanted to stick around and help with the rescue, but most of us would have just been in the way, so after a couple of orbits, we headed next, routinely, there was a nice of emotion. We were angry that they had been shooting as an, and had actually got-one of our goos. We wanted to load up and go right back to bomb them some more. Of course, they were just defending their territory and you really couldn't blame them for that. We met up with our tankers and three hours later we were back at Fairbort. We were relieved to learn that the F-16 pilot had been picked up and returned to his base by the time we land-ed._

_"All of our missions were from a night, and in just about all weather. We didn't often see the immediate results of our efforts. What made this mission is to memorise hows bright due to see a much. A combination of an area target, clear weather, full moon, and a fat of varied action pre and post-target almost make as feel like systems as we watched the mission wide."_

NORLE ANVLVL was the first use of the B-1 in an extended campaign. The 'Bone' proved to be the most effective heavy bomber in the Kosow Wars, from the standpoint of accuracy, ranging on target, and reliability. In the conflict's final phases, B-1s were often flown in 'terminal guidance' mode, receiving their target information from the Combined Air Operation Center (CACC) or Vienna, Italy when they arrived in the combat area. They were also able to change targets on route without any degradation of accuracy. Nearly 25 years are after the first B-1s called out, and 15 years after the first B-1B flee, the 'Bone' arrived as one of the most effective long-range bombers ever to go to war.

The B-1's combat history did not end over Kosow. The worst attack on US soil since World War Two resulted in the 'Bone' returning to action in the skies over Afghanistan.

_"For realize, of course, that this was an even trade,"_ It was being facetious, as I helped Major Scott Cameron unstamp and climb out of my **T-34 Mentor**. We were both performing in the first annual Las Vegas air show in 2000, me with the Lima Lima Flight Team, and Scott as a B-1 demonstration pilot. Our team head led to different the B-1 circumstances: a demo ride prior to the regular air show and Scott was one of the others.

Soot looked thought for a moment before saying, _"Well, you know,"_ _we might be able to get you "a Rome"_. "If you created the B-1 action had imagined for several years, but this comment sent it immediately to the front burner. It took several months of flight meeting on the part of Scott, but the Air Force finally officially approved a moment at aide for one.

Soot "Studio" Cameron in 1898 graduate of the US Academy. After a start of B-52 Irying (do all B-1 re-) members comes from the B-25 community?, Scott was eventually assigned to the B-1. At the time of our flight, he was Chief of Sandmarks and Evaluation for the 7th Operations Group (OG) at Dyes APS, near Aiben, Texas. The 7th owns the majority of operational B-1s and oversee the training of B-1 initiatives by the 28th Bomb Squadron (BS). The 7th also owns 'the 13th BS and the 9th BS.

When it became pretty certain that this flight was going to happen, I started to wonder just exactly where I would sit during the flight. The B-1 has four occurrences, but only the physics have any kind of an outside view. The "Whirazo" (Offensive Systems Officer, or OSO, and Defensive Systems Officer, or OSO) is steplanted the pilots, in darkened, defocted worges. They do have (early) small windows, but the bothers are usually pulled to enhance viewing of the electronic displays. The "Whirazo" are committed to the formaldehyde job of managing the complex electronics of the "Bone," "Whirazo" is a generic team, a derivation of Weapons Systems Officer (WS0), which was first applied to **F-4 Phantom** backseries. The B-1 back-seaters are cross-trained as OSOs and DSOs, but usually refer to themselves as "Whirazo,"

Although I really wanted the ride, I was not enthusiastic about sitting in the back. I confess that I am not a quick study when it comes to complicated electronics, so several hours of trying to understand the B-1's at exploit displays seemed like arero for a headache.) Nor was I particularly anxious it so in the followup jump set, who ecosystem would have to hung on the spare parachute and try to exit through the entry hatch in the bottom of the aircraft in the event of an emergency in-flight departure. In didn't have to worry about the latter. After the first B-1 accident (the crash of 84-0029 on 28 September 1987), in which the occupants of these seats did not get out of the aircraft, the Air Force has mandated that everyone who flies in the B-1 must be in ejection seat.

_"Oh, you'll sit the left" seat was the most welcome (and surprising) answer to that question. Scott said:" If I'll try a platform for the right seat, where I do not try to answer _is the instructor anyway. The placement of the gear record and flying stuck is more convenient for operation by the Go-Pilot Observatory. Unfortunately, you can't touch the stick."_ (This was in the immediate alteration of the collision of the submarine US GREFNETLSE 87-772) and a Japanese fishing boat [off Hawaii in 2000]. The media toward the presence of civilians on the GRENETLLE as a central factor in the accident and the services were long most careful about civilian control of military hardware. Much as I would like have been able to say I drew the 1.1, it really seemed more important to watch someone who knew that they were doing flying the jet. "I've." The boosting the generic team in an aircraft throughout the military. Scott even referred to my pop-driven T-34 as a 'Jet.' Although I did not touch the stick while we were airborne, I get 1/25 minutes of fly energy to performing a takeoff and landing in the simulator. (Without cranking)

Before I could fly, I had to fill some 'get ready' squares (the dye before the flight. A fast fortuit favors dry began at 0730 hours at the front gate, where I received my base. From there, it was on the 28th Bomb Squadron, where we would plan and brief the following day's mission.

Typical classes are approximately the students each for crew positions (Pilot, Cole, Offensive Systems Officer, and Defensive Systems Officer). While the OSO and DSO

It was a dark and stormy night when I awake. Well, it was dark and wet anyway. There was a 700 foot (213.4 s) ceiling and two mile (5.2 \(\mu\)c) visibility with light rain. Since the temperature was above 35 Fahrenstein (1.7 \({}^{\circ}\)Celsius), we were saved from the king restriction. (B-s do have auto-ice on the engine 'bubble' one and the inlet was, but not on the Radar Cross Section [RCS] baffle. Temperatures between 20 and 35 F [F-6.7 \(\mu\)c] and 1.7 \({}^{\circ}\)C] can cause racing on this vane and create the potential for Foreign Object Damage [FOD] to the engines. Engines are currently being upgraded to career these problems. Since the FOD engines cost in the neighborhood of 56 million each, this is a small consideration.) The shadow operations center started to fill up after 0530. Besides our two crews, the crews of _Tex_ and _Tex_ were hanging out. They were designed for knoted shortly after us, and we were being 10 gain up with them in the Air Reflecting (AR) track.

We got our first bad news of the day when we were informed that _flask 73_ would not be going anywhere until they located a missing screwdriver. The 'Bone' is a large, complicated aircraft. Maintenance is an around-the-clock afira and the current crew had discovered that a tool was missing from the previous shift. Since this tool had the potential to create a major cartridge, the aircraft would not move until it was found. We debated taking off without them, then meeting them later in the AR track, but ultimately decided to push the flight for a couple of hours. This gave us a chance to re-bef the whole deal.

We finally stepped onto the crew back to 801. First stop was the 28th BS Lide Support unit, where 1 picked up my thrlend, mask, survived well, and two horses, and all of these heads had been passinakingly fitted the day before by Stepan and his cable crew. (No small feat. This stuff is not designed for content, so when they ask you hour it feels, telling the truth does not necessarily elicit tip or vertical action.)

"Flask" (Wamraka) and "Cureman" (Howard) began loading our equipment hand SPCTRERE (86-010), a Black D 'Bone' of the 28th BS, as soon as we got off the bus. Softer the walk around, with me following. This inspection is designed to let another pair of experienced eyes look for any obvious anomalies. Scot pair potential orientation to the tires, which was a beating and have the potential to create big problems if they flow during takeoff.

The cockpit profile is a long and detailed procedure. "Fabi" had "stack" flash 'is in the left set during this procedure to speed things up and makes sure they were done right. While they were going through their checklists, "Caveman" was aligning the Inertial Navigation Systems (NDS), giving the Global Positioning System (GTS) time to acquire, and adjusting the various antennas. During all of this, there were several technical glibes. The crew referred to these as 'EMUX issues'. 'EMUX stands for Electrical Multiple system, which is you might guess is a controller for several of the electrical boxes, EMUX issues, "Averizon" as a reformulation algorithm to the B-I. It eliminated over 29,000 wires and 80 miles (128.7 \(\mu\)c) of wiring from major electrical subsystems and was Issured by Rockwell to the human spinal column. EMUX performs the functions of data conditioning, acquisition, command, and control for over 9000 inputs and signals. It is one of the features of the B-I. that makes it the most complex aircraft even built.

The crew members join/re for EMUX as "HAL," All was the younger who developed a malevolent and somewhat internistic personality in the movie "2001, A Space Odyssey". While these EMUX issues were 't immediately mission threatening, they did call for specialists to come to the cockpit to check 'workshop' (how the switches work) and two-ble-short the symptoms. When they finally get things were, they changed into the left seat.

The ground is represented by a series of jagged line... just you would expect from radar returns... while the aircraft's flight path is shown as a solid line).

Although the autopilot was flying the profile, Scott was controlling the throttle. (Auto throttle is also available to maintain a constant airspeed throughout the TFR profile.) Caveman's was busily updating as on our convex data, including what we could expect to see of the windshield. There is a 1000 front tail on the TFR, but plugged we cannot be hand-by-the aircraft down to 500 feet (1524.4), so at least 17 usually impressed with the capabilities of the automatic system. Scott took over and descended for our final approach to the target.

The target was listed as a road intersection, heavily populated by enemy troops. We would be simulating the dropping of fifty-six 500 ground (226.86). As 28 months to depopulate the intersection. The target card that Caveman had prepared us as comprehensive picture of the target data, which also showed the sun azimuth (horizontal bearing) and angle.

It has got to be impressive to see the big, that cars bother breaking by overhead with the wings away at 67.5\({}^{\circ}\).1 it is a resonance shift with the bomb blowy decay, which is why they are not opened for simulated drops. It looked down at the target card and the associated strip time to check for landmarks. There are other form of them in this part of the country...it least near the kind you are used to seeing. The radar picture was slightly more distinctive and there were cross checks so we made our target on a T&B (258.7) Caveman's cross checked point 18-1 at 45° set inside and off over 284" run in course, 1581 critical times (17.3 miles/27.88) away. We picked the place of the latter of buildings around the target when we were still ten times (16.18) out, but at most, the quoted equal to less than a minute. At two miles (3.2 x0), he crosses-checked point 18-2 at 45deg angle off to the right at 23 miles (37 x0). The navigation was precise and at less than one mile (16.8 x0), the worse scale will open and bombing came out as we listed over the center of the intersection 460 feet (182.93) above ground (\(J\) wondered if there was some skin crawling on those folds down there...did they know they had just been pulverized?)

Once we were off the target, it was time for some serious evasive, low-level flying. Just in time too, since we were entering the Bryce Canyon area of southern Utah. This is marked by some of the most spectacular survey on will ever see some level and believe me, it is more impressive at 500 feet (1524.44) Above Ground Level (AGL) Scott from a strict avoidance schedule, trying to maintain a relatively constant Mean Sea Level (MSL+) altitude, which meant a lot of flying through cuts and canyons. In consideration to the physics in the back, he called every turn that was made as he rolled left and right. Since the "Whizzox" usually have their heads buried in their scopes, they like it keep the shakes pulled on the small windows neat to their seats. Aggressive maneuvering at low altitude is a sure recipe for misuse if you are prone to vertigo and losing your outside reference. The turn cells helped the "Whizzox" to relate their seat of the parts feelings as the big bomber rod through the low-level turbulence of late afternoon.

Every military aircraft I have ever flown in has some characteristic that remained with me long after the flight. My first ride in an F+4 product management at the still legged, giving taxi. The F+6 is memorble for is control level because of the retiming seal. The F+8 was one of the more uncomfortable aircraft. The seat felt like a rock and Gosing of target second automobile. The power of the F+8 was unavoidable. The A+A was oilv and enjoys. The B-S2 takeoff - when the water injection run out -- was carry. The Mach One plus two level speed of the F+11 frontover was plentifed as in the desert. The smooth and honest controls of the T-34 scheduler are on the first flight, starting a 27 year low affair.

The 'Bone' is memorble for the noises, both quantity and quality. The big waves on the nose, which help to maintain stability, are in constant motion (they are computer-controlled) and one- able highly pulmonary rhunc-tilt-xue as they cycle. They are the most visible feature of the Low Atlantic Before Control (LARC) system. (LARC is also called the Structural Mode Control System, SMCS). The waves are derived from the "exic" values mounted on the Rockwell-built tropical MS-70 research aircraft. There are plenty of other noises from the back of the aircraft. They are hard to describe, but are not disconconcedancing to a pilot who is only used to associating noises like that with both radios. Most of these noises were caused by air-frame flexing, which is normal, but is accontended from the crew's standpoint because of the cooky's extreme feoreant location. Without LARC, which suppresses honoring in all directions, the flexing would be much more severe. The ride is hard, but watching Scott fly the aircraft tell me with the distinct impression that this 150 ton bother was flying like a much smaller and lighter fighter.

The race is the basic impressions. The more important, and relevant, impressions have to do the way the correct correct win this city and make things happen. It is how they are able to operate in the most complex and demanding mission environment of the 'Bone.' There are only 57 out of 95 B-S is available for duty and any given time. (Funding restrictions keep the owners on the ground). Given the worldwide mission of power projection they are required to perform and the effectiveness with which they have done this mission, you have to feel that your tax dollars are being well spent. To borrow an in-vogue advertising bigon, 'These Grays Are Good'.

## Operation ENDURING FREEDOM

_While this book goes to press, Operation ENDURING FREEDOM - the campaign against international terrorism - is just as few months into what President Bush promised would be doing, but conflict, if truth is the first casualty of war, then timely reporting is surely in the front ranks of casualties. Fortunately, modern communications goes a long way towards mitigating the fog of war. Pictures are invariably the most reliable records of current campaigns. You can believe that your use, for not want of what you read. With that in mind, we are presenting some of the first photos of B-1 operations in the current war, with limited editorial comment._

The year 2001 saw further constrictions in the B-1 force, as additional bombers were "de-funded" and added to the ranks of temporarily-parked-and-used-as-square-parts-inventory. (In order to keep all of the B-1s, aircraft, are routed through this pool. The funding keeps a percentage of the total force flying operational missions).

B-1s have played a central role in the strikes against Afghanistan. Following the 11 September 2001 terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center in New York City and the Pentation in Washington, President George W. Bush ordered contracts at An Afghanistan - Tallian government and on the network networks is sponsored. Attacks were particularly ordered on the facilities of all-Quads, the terrorist organizations run by Saudi-Don Osman his laden.

Under the operational command of the 28th Air Expedition Vi wing (EAW), B-1s are flying missions against Afghanistan from the Indian USA island of Diego Garcia. Diego Garcia is a 17 square mile (44 x4) card used in the central Indian Ocean. It is in the Cnagos A-1B takes off from Diego Garcia for Afghanistan on T October 2001. The Laner attached Tallian and al-Qaeda targets during Operation ENDURING FREEDOM - the US response to the terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001. Five other 'Bones' are parked on the ramp, across from a KC-10 tankertransport. (USAF)Archipelago, which is part of the British Indian Ocean Territory. Since the late 1970s, the US has used Diego Garcia as a base for operations in southwest and south Asia. Living conditions for flight creves and ground personnel on the island are aberrant. The USAF ground creves worked around the clock in the firf time week of the campaign, before settling into a routine of 12-hour shifts.

Lancers assigned to the 28th AEW are drawn from the 28th Bomb Wing (BW) at Ellworth AFB, South Dakota; the 366th Wing at Mountain Home AFB, Idaho; and the 7th BW at Dress AFB, Texas. 18-18 missions from Diego Garcia are 12 to 15 hours in length and cover total distances to 5500 miles (8851-2 x). A bombing missions have been known against a variety of Tallah and 4-Queeda, including early warning stars, ground forces, command-and-control facilities, airfields, and aircraft. More than two kinds of the bombing dropped were Precision Guided Mountains (OPMs), using either laser or Global Positioning System (GPS) guidance to hit their targets.

During the initial phases of the air war against the Tallah and 4-Queda, US Department of Defense (DOD) sources attributed 80% of the missions to heavy bombers. The border force was comprised of B-1,B-2A **Sprit**, and B-2S2 Strattorres aircraft. The B-1s and B-2S2 deployed from the US to Diego Garcia, from where they flew their missions. All B-2 missions originated at their home airfield, Whitemen AFB in Missouri. After making their attacks, the Spirts recovered at Diego Garcia for a crew rest period before returning to Whitemen.
