## Spitifire Mk 21

As the development of the Spitifire progressed into the later war years, features that had distinguished the series were gradually changed and with the F MG 21, the original wing wing was up to a new design without the same guiding trading code variance. So different was this variant that is, that the same ’ Victor was put forward, the leading being that the machine was no longer a spitifire, It was in effect, the Super Spitifire’ that had first taken inside form in DPLS on the Mk/vk/or subsequent arrival.

Butist simulation on random time that machine plans for higher arrangement was reflected in the first 21, there being no provision for machine plans. Four common conducted to a high antenna weight, which during series development, had opted up from 480 ns. Only for the Mk 1 to 760 ns. In the Mk 21.

To accommodate the baseline airplane, the Mk 21's manufacturing was using/fined and sponsored further outdoor and previously an open interface, the main markets were completely enclosed by droons for the first time. Production devices commenced in September 1944, Castle Hormachi building some 100 examples - a small fraction of all 38,000 originally ordered.

The Doverseant for the Mk 21 was the Gunfton 61 or 65 of 2048 by with a fire-flude Hotel, or two three blade contra creating Rocket receivers respectively. The blade diameter was measured to 11.8 as a result of better ground clearance offered by the longer undercliang.

## Seafire F XV

The sole wartime version of the Seafire series to be powered by the Gitton engine, the Seattle F XV was a random of four Sofire markets with the storage of the Seattle II. The telescope was locally part of the Safire VV that the changed in and under and replete lightened of the sky will start the hot XV using real test trials, and the Gitton engine installation and accessivity of the kit, although the sequential use stationed to mask requirements.

Designated Gitton V, this engine gave 1875 bit to witnessed boost pressure for fuel and offered a sustained air of eight hours on medium altitudes. Interested fuel to 100 gals, capacity was 15 gals, more than any previous Seafire, but Grup Vols, could be the end-user already got to send vibrations in the understanding. Recognite releases of the Seafire V included ten underwater stations, and ratings on the water engine engine covering embracor rock zones. Later, the production machines were fitted with the single antator hook of the Seafire II.

Problems with the opposite peopleic routing of the Gitton led to numerous diffusion in service, operational use togetting antil September 1948. So efficient was the Seafire IV to operate from cameras that is was prohibited from amburately flying in mid-1948, pending modifications to the supercomputer which. These were carried out in January 1947.

## Seafire 17

Reflecting development of the SeafireSeafire series in general, the Seafire 17 had a cut down four-stage voltage with a bubble energy that was externally similar to the Seafire XV. The last 30 XVs had the cut down 1st, but for most purposes, they were cleanly interior to the Seafire II, which also other less obvious modifications running it a much more efficient start to create or destroy operations.

Principles, the understanding was strengthened and designated to give the ideas to compare strong, improving ground clearance for the specified blade fins. Built in \(\mu\) and \(\mu\) stations, the Seafire II can extend to 24 cameras in the steering, or a 304 fuel test test of the pittor's seat. The capacity was increased by 60 gatl, while the speed of the Seafire II can be controlled to take 22.5 gals, trigger using more each other using general. These turns were tight-complete but took to be realized for all measurements and establish a bomb in the example of the centimetric data.

Not intended as frontline equipment, the Seattle 45, still exhibited the undesirable characteristics of the Seattle XY, the five blade principle making the tendency to sample eight orders and it was virtually immediate to fly in a straight line. Maintenance was also lengthy.

Nevertheless, the aircraft's potential performance was an improvement on earlier miss of Seattle, and armament was increased to four Zoom carmon. Only 50 cameras were left, the flyer's official handline qualities making its service life very limited, even in second line ethics.

The penultimate Seattle variant was the FFR 45, represented here by L420, one of 50 built at Castle Bomsuite, and the only Sestings produced there. Not a success, the MK 45 found little service use even with second line units. (Vickars)
