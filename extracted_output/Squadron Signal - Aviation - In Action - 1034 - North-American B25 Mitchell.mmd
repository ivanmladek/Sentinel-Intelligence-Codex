## North American B-25 Mitchell

In 1938 the United States Army Air Force issued a circular proposal, Specification Number 98-102, which called for a twin-engined medium attack bomber. North American Aviation, Inc. of milewood, California, in an attempt to meet these requirements and with a contact, initiated a design proposal which they designated MA =40-1. This design called for a twin-engined, twin-lately, tricyclic landing geared, high wing monopline of a rather clean aerodynamic configuration. The pilot and co-pilot were to be seated in tandem in a long greenhouse type cocklimit that to that in the Martin B-10 bomber and North American's own 047. The bomber-haride-raviage was to be housed in a glared nose that afforded excellent forward and down vision. As an attack bomber the NA-40-1 provided the bombardment for a single 304. Calt, M-2 machine gun mounted in a rotating nose blister. Two fixed forward fringe.30s were to be mounted in each wing. A dorsal turner of the powered type was to be operated by a radio-guinner and the fifth crewman would handle two more.30s, one mounted to fire downward through the floor and the other to be located in a pilot position. Each gun was to carry 500 rounds of armuntation. The maximum bomb load would be 1,200 pounds and 476 gallos of fuel would feed the two Patt & Whitney R-1830-86G-3 Twin Wash radial engines that developed 1,100 horsepower eachhs all added to a gross weight of 1,9500 pounds. As the design looked very good, work soon commenced on a prototype aircraft.

In January 1939 the prototype was rolled out and test: flow by N.A. test pilot Paul Balfour. The top speed turned out to be a disappointing 265 miles per hour but the design obviously held a great deal of promise so the design team set to work to improve the performance figures.

To increase speed the Pratt and Whitney engines were replaced by Wright Cyclones producing 1,350 hp for take off, also radial engines. The aircraft, now redesignated the NA-40-2 or NA-40B was flow from Los Angeles to Wright Field at Dayton, Ohio in March for official Air Corps-evaluation. Maximum speed now was 285 mph even though gross weight had increased to 21,000 pounds. The Air Corps put the plane through two weeks of testing and was impressed with the results. Turning the NA-40B over to the attack bomber tests program for further evaluation resulted in the destruction of the prototype. Major Younger Pitts took it up and ran through some tests. However, while attempting to turn into Wright Field approach he lost control and crashed at a high rate of speed.

The company had planned export versions of the original design up to a proposed NA-40-7 design, but the Air Corps asked for a number of modifications and changes. North American management asked R.H. Rice and J.L. Atwood to redesign the airplane. The new prototype was given the company designation NA-40-2. When finished, it had the appearance which was to remain pretty much constant throughout the entire series. To accomodate the doubled bomb load the Air Corps demanded, the greenhouse for pilot and co-pilot was eliminated by raising the fuselage. The wing attachment point was lowered from a shoulder location to midwing which gave a better main spar location within the fuselage. This change improved aerodynamic design as well as altering the general aspect of the airplane. The engine handles were cleaned up in profile and extended after of the wing. A tail come with hand held 50 caliber machine gun increased firepower. The bombarder's compartment was modified to blend into the new fuselage, thus eliminating the bulbose. The Army approved the NA-62 on 10 September 1939. The outbreak of war in Europe caused the Air Corps to forego further prototyping. The need for aircraft production was so urgent that for all practical purposes the NA-40B served as the KB-25.

B-25(Na-62)

On 20 September 1939 a production contract valued at $11,771,000 was awarded to North American for 184 aircraft to be designated as the B-25. North American had assigned the manufacturers number NA-62 to the design. An affirrane was delivered on a July to Wright Field, Ohio for static testing. The initial airplane bore a family resemblance to the NA-40 with its shining bare metal finish and an unbroken wing dihedral. A total of 195,000+ engineering unknowns plus 6,500 new engineering drawings were expanded on the NA-62. The first fully completed B-25 made its initial test flight on 19 August 1940.

Sent to the USAR testing grounds at Wright Field at run through a series of test flights, the aircraft seemed to have only marginal directional stability. The fault seemed to be caused by excessive addition. This was rectified by altering the outer wing panels to an absolute horizontal position. This gave the 25-5 characteristics with airspeed back, which remained unchanged through the production life of the series. The new wing geometry was installed on the 100th production aircraft. A total of twenty four B-25 were delivered during 1940 before the model gave way to the B-model. About this time the name "Mitchell" was given to the B-25, showing the late General Billy Mitchell from many consider the father of modern American military station.

The B-25 featured a five man crew. The pilot and co-pilot were seated side by the net redesigned Tease. The plan owner operated a single 50 caliber machine gun in a glanced airset in the tail from a zone position. A 30 caliber machine gun with a rather limited field of fire was mounted in a socket in the nose to be manned by the bombardier. Other 30 machine guns were located in the sides of the fuselage and in the roof of the fuselage atr of the wing. The fuselage was of semi-monotone aluminum alloy construction with altalc alloy skin. The portion of the fuselage above the wing and between the front and rear that roiling roads was permanently attached to the wing and was repamble with the center section. The wings were the cantilever type with a mid-level position. All metal construction was used on the wings which were divided into five sections, including the center section that could be detached from the remainder of the fuselage, outer wing sections detachable from the center section and removable wing tips. The outer wing sections were the single year type with acid skinning, alterations were metal with fabric covering. The B-25 had hydraulically operated slotted wing flaps in two sections. The tail section was a cantilever monomagne type, all metal with twin and radules. The tricyclic landing gear was fully retractable and hydraulically operated. Three shaded Hamilton Standard constant-speed, full-fatine properties with anti-tergers and twin Wright Cyclone GR-2600-AS engines produced, 356 horse power at 2300 rpm at 5,000 feet, with a maximum take-off time of 1,800 horse power at 2400 rpm. Internal bond storage was provided in the fuselage beneath the center section for a ton and a half of bonbs. The B-25's top speed was 332 mph.

The first operational group to the new bumber was the 17th Bombardment Group (Medium) which began to receive their B-25s in 1941. The 17th was based at McDcroff Field, Washington and began to fly coastal patrols after the attack on Pearl Harbor. They continued this activity after being transferred to Pendicon, Oregon. Moving east to the Lexington County Air Port in South Carolina they carried on patrols over the Atlantic Ocean before another station change took them to Barsdale Air Field in Louisiana and more patrol duties over the Gulf of Mexico. The 17th thus became the first unit to act as coastal defenders over the waters of the entire coastal area of the United States. The B-25 is credited with being the first American bomber to sink an Axis submarine in the Atlantic Ocean in American territorial waters. It had already been given credit for getting a Japanese sub in the Pacific.

This B-25 was one of the original service test aircraft that was assigned to the THI Bombardment Group's 95th Bomb Squadron and is one of the straight wing B-25s from the initial production batch. The Group was on maneuvers at the time this photo was taken at Felts Field in Washington. The obvious difference from the No. 1 craft is the "production" tail. [(Li Hendix)]
Another of the first nine B-25s produced with the straight wing. This also was a 95th Bomb Squadron aircraft. The Squadron was the first to sink an Axis submaning, getting in on 24 December 1941. The sinking was accomplished by Bombarder George Hammond who was in Bristol Holstorny's crew. Because the crew had forgotten to take off the pilot tube cover, Hammond had to use his foot as a bomb sight. Nevertheless he laid one right on the coming tower of the Japanese craft. Holstorn later was one of the Doolittle raiders. [Lin Hendrix]

A close up of the same aircraft shows the insignia of 95 BS and aircraft number 11. Many of the 17th's crew became members of the Doolittle Group after flying the B-25s at Felts and later at Columbia, SC. [Lin Hendrix]

He later became one of the Doolittle Riders and was the one who spoke Russian. Some Russian pilots had been sent to Felts to learn the B-25s which they fleve their pursuit ships. The 55th Pursuit, equipped with P-43s, was In Oregon at the time and used to like to dogglight with the Russians. This resulted in tweets popping from the wings of B-25s and tail gunners with cracked ribs. One P-43 pilot was actually forced into the ground near Eugene, Oregon. [Lin Hendrix]B-25A

When theory is put into action, it is often found wanting. Such was the case at the start of World War II with bombers and the role in which they were to be employed. By definition every bomber had to operate over enemy-held territory during its mission. In carrying out its role, it becomes exposed to any actions the enemy can take to reduce its effectiveness, including fighter interceptions and anti-interatt weapons fire from the ground. Guide early in European action it became painfully evident that lightly armed bombers were no match for enemy figures. Even exocorted bombers could not be protected 100 % by their own figures in the face of determined attacks. Also escorting fighters were powerless to protect the bombers against risk. As these ftruths were brought home in early battles, the planners had to do something to counteract these hazards as much as possible. This meant increasing the defensive firepower of the individual bomber and doing whatever might be possible to provide added protection for the aircraft and its crew from flask. The latter could be implemented much faster than the former.

In the case of the North American Mitchell,this action resulted in the first model change and produced the B-25A. Self-sealing fuel tanks were installed to cut down the danger of fire and the pilots were given some armor plates as personal protection. Hopefully these changes would be useful against aircraft and flask both. These modifications commenced with the 25th model on the assembly line. The air erws always welcomed anything that added to the survival rate.

However, to make these modifications it was necessary to sacrifice something in return. Maximum fuel capacity was reduced by 246 gallons and the range fell off 750 miles. The maximum gross weight increased 210 pounds while to speed dropped from 322 mph to 315 mph. Service ceiling was down from 30,000 feet to 27,000 feet and the rate of climb suffered slightly. The B-25A was eleven inches higher than the B-25, otherwise the aircraft were for the most part identical. Forty B-25A were produced.

The mark of a good basic design is it can be changed to suit new conditions with a minimum of difficulty and not suffer unduly in the process. The B-25 design was to prove over and over the soundness of the original aircraft design as it underwent many changes during the course of the war and even after the end of the war and remained a first line aircraft throughout its service life.

## B-25B (Mitchell I)

While the A model was an attempted solution to the problem of providing additional crew protection, it remained for the B to resolve the problem of increased defensive firepower. North America began by removing all machine guns except the one mounted in the bombardier's nose compartment. The tail cone was reduced considerably in size, shortening the fuselage one foot two inches. A glared area was kept to serve as a prone observation post. A photographic station was added just forward of this position. Bendix electrically operated turres were incorporated into the fuselage in dorsal and ventral locations with twin.50 caliber machine guns in each. The ventral turter was fully retractable and was operated by a gunner who labeled over a periscope-gunlight, a most uncomfortable position if the position had to be manned for any length of time.

The British had been experimenting with powered turres for some time before the war as it had become increasingly clear that as speed increased the exposed gunners position became more difficult to man. Turres seemed to be the answer as they offered protection for the gunner, made for better accuracy, and were better guintery platforms. It was also possible to operated multiple guns and obtain a devastating cone of fire. Ideally the aircraft should be designed around its turres as they were extremely complex and bulky gadgets. Space had to be provided for the gunner and his equipment and in turn he had to ride the guns and turn as they turned to give smooth tracking of the target. The turres that operated in a 360 degree arc had to obtain electrical power during rotation. A fire interrupter system had to be provided to prevent the gunner from shooting pits and pieces of this own aircraft while tracking an enemy plane. It had to be mounted so as to produce as little drag on the aircraft as possible. Mounting had to be accomplished without sacrificing the structural integrity of the fuselage. Its effect on the center of gravity had to be calculated and then compensated for by the design team. Personal equipment for the aerial gunner such as parachute, oxygen flasks, intercomment, electrical heating outlet for his flying suit. life preserver, and other items as the mission or theatre required, had to be fitted either into or onto the turret.

That North American's people were able to incorporate not one but two turres, one of which retracted, into the B-25B and still produce 100 of the aircraft during 1941 is an engineering marvel. How well they did the job is reflected in performance and specification figures. The B models maximum weight was upped to 28,460 pounds, an increase of just 1,360 pounds over the A. Top speed decreased a mere 15 mph and the rate of climb to 15,000 feet fell off only.4 second. The 1300 mile range was only 50 miles less than that of the A.

The B-25B was destined to take part in perhaps the most famous single raid of the war. The mission--the Dooplittle raid to bomb the Japanese homeland When this raid was in its early planning stages the B-18 was the first aircraft to be considered, though later his was broadened to include the B-23, B-25, and B-26. The B-18 lacked the necessary range, the B-23 was ruled out because its wing span was too wide to enable it to clear the "island" of our carriers. The B-26 proved to need too long a take off, thus clearing the decks, so to speak, for the B-25 to make history.

It. Col. James H. Dooplittle, who was to lead the raid, selected and trained a group of volunteers taken mostly from the 17th Bomb Group and the 59th Recon Squadron. While training was going on the aircraft were modified to increase range. The ventral turter was removed to make way for a fuel cell which raised the fuel capacity to 1,141 gallos while subtracting 600 pounds from the empty weight. The maximum weight was raised to 31,000 pounds on take of but would decreases as fuel was burned on the target. Other modifications included removing the secret Norden bomship and replacing it with the 20 emt wonder, the Mark Twain, which was more accurate for low level bombing than the expensive and top secret Norden. Twin fake.50s of wood were installed in the tail to discourage stem attacks by the enemy fighters.

The US Hornet, with B-25B sashed to its deck, set course from San Francisco on April 1942. The 18 April launch was made maintained but was rendered necessary when the task force was spotted by Japanese patrol ships. The Dooplittle force bombed various targets including Tokyo and while the damage was slight the psychological effect was tremendous. Although all the B-25B were eventually lost, most of the air crew survived, and the overall effect seems to have justified the cost. As a morate booster to the American people it was outstandingly effective and the initial shock to Japan soon was replaced by a desire that it never happen again. Against that possibility four first-line fighter groups were kept in the home islands even though they were needed badly in the South Pacific.

In April other B-25S serving with the 13th and 19th Soudrons of the 3rd Bomb Group in Australia also were equipped with auxiliary fuel tanks, and along with a trio of B-17s, ten of them took off for a secret base in the Philippines. Arriving there safely they began operations from concealed airstrips deep in the jungle. In a harassment type of operation, they worked over Japanese shipping and supply areas, doing a lot of damage while avoiding serious losses. The rest of the 3rd Bomb Group was in action during this period against the enemy in New Guinea. From this point on B-25 participation in the South Pacific was on the increase.

The RAF received 23 B-25B as the Mitchell i with serials running from FK 161 through FK 163. These aircraft were not sent into combat, serving in training roles and for crew familiarization purposes.

## B-25 G/D

On 28 September 1940 the Army ordered an updated version of the B-25 featuring a number of modifications dictated by combat experience. This was the first of the series to really go into mass production. North American started manufacturing the C model on a line at line biofowed while the D Model went into production at Kansas City. The two models were actually identical in all respects and the dash model numbers and letters simply indicated which plant produced the adjacent. Deliverless began in January 1942.

An autopilot had been fitted in the planes from by the Dobitie Haliders and this was now added as standard equipment on both the C and D. The Wright R-2600-9 engines were replaced by the more powerful R-2600-13 with Hollywood saturators. A Ge-layer system, 24 volt electrical system, and larger wing tanks plus a removable bomb stay tank were fitted. This raised the maximum fuel capacity to 1,225 gallions for terrying purposes. The bomb was enlarged and external fitting to carry bombs under the wings and a short tropped under the belly were included. The 30 caliber rose machine gun was replaced by a.50 caliber gun and another fixed.50 caliber to be fitted by the pilot was added to the nose. The turests were retained though the ventral one was deleted as some of the early batches. An autopattern was included as a blister on the upper forward rectangle to enable the navigator to take star or sun fikes more easily. All changes usually mean added weight and the C and D models were no exception to this rule. Combat gross weight stood at 33.500 pounds on both. Despite the extra 100 horse power, top speed slipped to 282 miles per hour. The maximum take-off weight of 41,800 pounds was seldom used. Bomb load of 3,000 pounds was standard and 21,000 rounds of.50 ammunition was carried for the six guns. Under certain conditions the bomb load could be increased to 5,200 pounds by use of the external racks. The introduction of individual exhaust stacks for each cylinder requiring special exit faiings on the engine cowling gave later Cs and Ds an easily distinguishable identification feature.

Block numbers on the B-25C ran from the C-1 through the C-5, -10, -15, -20, to the -25. The D series ran through the identical dash numbers plus the -30 and -35. In all, 1619 B-25Cs, and 2290 B-25Ds were produced during the production run.

The RAF received the B-25C and B-25D models as the Mitchell II, getting 167 CS and 371 US with serials running F1046 1E218; FL2617 to FL2709; FL3626 to FL3636 1F8362 to FL3637; FL3637; FL3637; FL3638 to FL3637; FL3639; FL3641 to FL3641. The Netherlands ordered 162 B-25C-15 to be activated as 15-22 through the NB-283, Four B-25D scores were sold to the RCAF while 29 were obtained by the Brazilian Air Force under Land-Lease.

Two B-25Cs were modified to become the K3-25E and NB-25E, these were the first Mitechs to be given as Afghanistan. The KB25E was equipped with hot air de-levers for the wings and tail surfaces while the XB-25E received thermo de-levers in the same locations. These projects were eventually dropped, possibly because the Mitchells were being used almost exclusively in tropical or semi-topical areas.

One B-25D was converted to be used for photore reconnaissance training as the F-10-A. As this proved to be relatively successful at total of ten of this version was acquired. The F-10 was given the more powerful R-2600-29 engines and were stripped of as much excessive weight as possible to improve both speed and range. Cameras were mounted in a tr-metrogen arrangement in a chin flailing. Other cameras were mounted in the rear of the fuselage.

B-25G

The type of targets in the Southwest Pacific Area were not suited to the massed bomber assault that was being employed successfully in the European Theater. While in the SWPA the targets were not as heavily offended by Italy, they were widely dispersed and well camoutized and thus did not readily lend themselves to high level precision bombing. New tactics were evolving that suited the conditions in the theater. Skip bombing, parafrag bombs, and starting had been experimented with and developed to the point that gave maximum effect in magic and island hopping warfare. Twin engine mediums were ideally suited to these conditions as they had the range, speed, and maneuverability necessary tohit and run tactics and were more economical on fuel than their four original dig pictures. The B-25 seemed to have been designed with all this in mind. Above all, it was easy to adapt to the strafer rule.

Lt. Coil. Paul Gunn and Jack Fox, a North American Tech Red has been modifying B-25Cs to this role in the Southwest Pacific with great success. They had started by adding a pair of.50s to the two already in the nose and eliminating the bombarpliers compartment. Then they took out the ventral turn which had been a total flase5, quinners were destanding after six, the optical areas were usually coated with mud on take off, or greed by oil in flight. Twin posts were placed on each side of the fuselape under the cobort and fitted with.50s to give "Pappy" Gunn's B-25s eight forward firing.50 caliber machine guns fired by the pilot. They even added a pair of.30s in the landing bay light compartment in each wing. Last but not least in a few of the conversations, a 20mm carbon was fitted in the bombarpliers's crawway. Later, after Northern American engineers profested, the.30s were removed from the wings. Flight testing had proved that these installations were effective after the skinning in the vicinity of the twin packs was seeded up and added bracing eliminated the cracking that had appeared along the wings leading edges between the fuselage and the engine nacelines. Ninety-seven additional fittings were fabricated by the people in the 4th Air Depot in Townsville.

All of this activity in the field led to the B-25G. After the successful mounting of the 20mm in the B-25C, experiments with the B-18A Bolo, the old Douglas that had been considered for the Doolittle razid, fitted with a standard Army Trum Field Gun indicated that the B-25 could also handle the big cannon, Gunn's jury bringing had indicated that a cannot could be mounted in the crawway and that it was the ideally location for the 75mm. The M-4 cannon measured yet 66 inches and weighed close to 900 pounds. It was mounted in a cradle to absorb the shock and extended under the pilot s seat to allow for a 2 inch recoil. The navigator became the cannomer. It was not an avulable job aslaming eme of the 3 inch 150 bend shells into the breach in the limited space available required dexterity and strength. 21 rounds were carried. The nose itself was shortened and falef around the muzier of the camera. While "Pappy" Gunn had cut the crew of his modified so three, the B-25G was intended to have a crew of four. The overall length was shortened to 51 feet. Maximum speed dropped to 278 mph. This 50s were mounted in the nose with 400 pounds per gunt to enable the pilot to stress fall and serve as an aiming reference for lifting the big gun. When the pilot had the tracers in line with this target are mapped off a round with the 75.The aircraft studed,some say with it stood still, while others claimed it few backwards for a micro-second. Later ds had a tail gun's position re-inflated, mounting a single 50. Some also had the side blister gun positions also standard to maf B-25s.

Under combat conditions the gun was found to be accurate enough but due to the hand feed, the rate of the free walk. Sodium could more than four rounds before landing an attack. Further we measure action could be taken when the cannon was used, putting it into disfavor with the crews. In combat the 75s were used against a variety of targets. Shipping was an especially good target as a direct hit with the cannon could sink most of the coastal vessels used by the Japanese. Even destroys were sitting ducks for a flight of the B-25 carbon ships. The B-25 son merged as Kingston of the Pacific because its chief competition, the B-26 was being sent to Europe. During the production life of the B-25G a total of 405 were produced at inflewood. Two were sent to the RAF for evaluation but none were ordered by the British. As targets worthy of a 75mm shell got scarce, the gun was frequently removed and replaced by twin.50s.

A bare metal finished B-25J-20 of 499 BS, show the "Bats Outa" Hell" Insignia in Pale Blue.

Two shots of B-25Js of 477 Bomb Group, an all-Black unit. This Group drew together four new Bomb Squadrons and 99 Fighter Squadron which had flown 9-40s over North Africa. The Group was commanded by cold. Benjamin O. Davis, who went on to become the Air Force's highest ranking Black. The photo to the left shows a plane of 616 BS, that above of 618 BS. [Dr. R. Rose]

This B-25J of the 499 BS "Air Apaches", of the famous 345 BG displays a curious armament arrangement. Rather than use the available factory-kit, B-gun nose, the armers of the 499th have jury tagged a five own set up adapted from a standard bombedier nose. As was the case with the early C and D gunship conversions, the glazing has simply been painted over. [USAF]The Mitchell in U.S. Naval Service :PBJ

The U.S. Navy received a total of 706 B-258 to be used by the U.S. Marine Corps aviation branch as land based bombers. The B-258 became the PBJ-1 outside the B-258 and B-258 became the PBJ-1C and PBJ-1D respectively. These were used on anti-submarine patrol duties. The Naval version was equipped with radar and carried depth charges as internal normal offensive weapon in place of bombs. They could also double as tored-bombers should the need arise. In this role they were the PBJ-1G. The B-258 was the PBJ-1H in the USN/USUSC inventory while the B-258 became the PBJ-1J. The H remained about the same in Marine service as did the J except for some minor differences in the radio and other small equipment.

There doesn't seem to have been any special reason for the U.S. Marine getting Mitchell's receipt that the Army Air Force had a surplus and the Marine apparently were willing to try their lock with the type. The thinking probably was that they could prove useful in close support of beachheads and landings. VMB 443, the first PBJ-1 squadron, was commissioned at Cherny Point, North Carolina on March 1943. At that time the only Marine flight personnel were single place pilots, so VMB 413 in effect became a training squadron for navigators, radiomen, and ganners. These arrows that trained with VMB 413 then served as the nucleus for follow on squadrons. On 15 September 1943 VMB 423, 433, and 443 were commissioned followed by VMB 611, 612, 613, and 614 on 1 October 1943 to complete the initial Marine Medium Bombardment Group. The first to be ordered overseas was the original squadron, VMB-413, with left for California on 3 December 1943 and thence to Espinurte Santo. In January 1944 the squadron began combat indotration training before going into combat from Stirling Island in mid-March 1944.

Initially operations were confined to night ralds on Rabaud, Kavieng, and Bougianville. Soon daylight missions were started and flown on every third day. Despite heavy losses early in their career (two planes with full events on 22 March, aitching that killed two men and totaled the aircraft on 1 April, another plane and full crew on 22 April and a fifth P4h by Italy over Rabaud and lost with its crew on 15 May 4MB 413 received a communication from CanMiSo for developing bombing techniques and perfecting night intruder tactics. VMB 423 released 413 on Stirling Island in 15 May 1944 but 413 along with 423, 433, and 443 remained in the Solomomons-Bismarch area until August 1945 when they were transferred to Malabiano in the Philippines.

A total of nine PBJ Quadrons got overseas before the war ended. These Soudarons lost 26 Mitchell in combat and an additional 19 due to operational accidents while in the combat zone.

This shot gives a clear view of late war wing-tip radome, which replaced the earlier ventral mount. The undersurfaces of later PJs were the lighter Dove Grey.

This PJs-1H, seen on the ramp at North American's Inglewood plant, shows the tell hook position to good effect. [D.W. Lucabugh]

This PJs-1J [64876] has the radome on the wing tip and a full complement of add-on guns. [USN via D.W. Lucabugh]

## Miscellaneous Mitchells

War Weary B-25s were turned over to the various training commands to be used as flying classrooms and for other training purposes. The B-25C, D, G, and J became the AT24C, A, B, and D in that order and later they were redesignated as T8-25C, A, B, and D respectively. A number of these Mitchells were assigned to Turnus Army Air Field in Arizona late in the war and used in the BTO school there. Many WNN will reveal that the popular definition of BTO was "Big Time Operation" but in this case the initials stood for Bombing Through Overcast. The school was set up to train bombardiers in the new techniques of radar bombing which would enable them to locate, and hit their targets even if it was totally obscured by cloud cover or darkness. Many training flights were made from Yuma to the coastal cities of Southern California. The aircraft would fly out over the Pacific Ocean and then turn in towards the coast and the bombardiers would pick up their targets electronically and make dry runs on the such cities as San Diego or Los Angeles. The program was supposed to develop trained men to locate targets in Japan or Europe should the war continue longer than expected. Other B-25s were converted to high speed transports after having all turders and using removed.

The B-25 series served with a number of Allied nations during the war and on into the postwar era. A complete roll call of nations operating the Mitchells with totals where known in parenthesis includes Australia (147), Brazil (20), Canada (100+), Nationalsi China (131), People's Republic of China, France, Great Britain (661), Republic of Indonesia, The Netherlands (249), Peru, Russia (870), and Venezuela.

In the post war period the B-25s like other obsolescent aircraft were turned over to the National Guard units. Others were turned over to MARS, SAC, TAC and ADC. Some went to individual air fields to be used as tracks, and some released as surf surplus found their way into civilian use. These in many cases underwent transformations that turned them into rather plus company aircraft or private airplanes for wealthy individuals. A few went to collectors and to museums for display purposes. Still others were pressed into civil use as firebombers and crop clusters.
