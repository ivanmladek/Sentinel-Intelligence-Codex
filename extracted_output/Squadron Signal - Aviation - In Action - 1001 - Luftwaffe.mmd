## Introduction

The Signal "Lufufufufte in Action" series has been put together to provide you with what we feel is an outstanding photographic coverage of the several types of aircraft shown within these pages.

Instead of the posted factory photographs seen in so many of the publications available to you, we are going through many private collections for those photos that show the aircraft in their real surroundings. In short, we are striving for realism in our photo coverage.

Because plan views and technical information for these aircraft are available in so many other publications, you will find little of it here. Our photographs will speak for themselves and the captions will merely serve to point out details of each photo in order to enhance your understanding of the subjects pictured here.

At least 80% of the photos in this book have never been published before. Because of this, we think we have a unique thing going and it is our wish to share it with you.

We earnestly hope you enjoy our efforts.

Squadron/Signal ArchiveFocke-Wulf FWV189 'Uhnu'

First variants of the FWV189 were developed in 1938. The aircraft was envisioned as a multi-purpose plane, performing such duties as ground attack, reconnaissance, light bomber or training. Used mainly as a reconnaissance aircraft, the FW189A played a major role in the combined arms tactics used by the Germans during the War. Altogether 846 FW189 were built during the years 1939 to 1943.

A FW189A flies over the Russian Landscape. The yellow bands around the engine booms were very characteristic of Luthwaffe aircraft operating on the Eastern Front.

A FW 189A runs up its engines before a reconnaissance flight. Note the Ju 88s in the background, the stack of bombs on the ground and the ground crewman trying hard not to lose his hat.

This FW 189A has just made is 2,000th flight of the Gruppe. Note the pilot's seat and armored head rest as well as the upward sliding hinged entrance doors built into the glassed areas of the canopy.

Ground crewman in their characteristic black work uniforms prepare this FW 189A-2 for a flight. Note the open entrance hatch in the rear cupola and the open machine gun access panel on the wing root.

The FW 189 F series aircraft featured more powerful Argus as 411 engines as well as a twin MG 81 mount called MG 812 (Z for Zwiling or twin) in both the rear position and the dorsal position, pictured here.

This view shows to advantage the rear glused in portion of the FW 189, which could be rotated by the gunter to allow his guns an upward, downward or sideward field of fire.

The rear gunter of FW 189 F-1 behind his MG 812 mount. Note the belt feed apparatus to the right of the guns.

After attaching the bomb to its rear shackle, it is then hooked to the front shackle. This aircraft bears the markings of 2 (H)/31, a short range reconnaissance group.

With one bomb already attached, the armorers lift the next one up to its shackle. The FW 189 could carry four such bombs.

The FW 189 also served as personal transport for many high-ranking officers. Here, an Army General prepares for a flight.

With the dark clouds on the horizon indicating a storm front, ground crewmen go about teling this FW 189 down and covering her vulnerable areas with canvas.

So much has been written about the Focke Wulf FW 190 that very little will be devoted here to its development and use. The FW 190 was the only single angled radial engined lighter to be committed to operational use by the Germans during World War II. A total of 19,999 FW 190s were built between 1942 and 1945, of which 13,365 were used as figures or night fighters, while 6,634 were used as fighter bombers or close-support aircraft. Of these 19,990 machines, there were over 280 different variants, including experimental types, pre-production aircraft and one-of-a-kind types, as well as the different operational types.

A good close-up view of the 'nose of a FW 190 A.4 showing to advantage the 2 x 20 mm MG 151 canoms in the wing roots, the paddle bladed propeller and the fan behind the propeller which compressed the air flowing over the radial BMW 801 D engine.

A "Schwarm" (flight of four) of FW 190 As of JG 3 flies over its home base in Holland.

A unique photo of a FW 190 of JG 54 parked by a Finnish flown Fiat G-50 on an airfield in Finland.

Here a FW 190 has its radio battery charged by a portable electrical generator. The jack from the cable is plugged into the connector to the battery compartment.

An interesting view of the upper surface of the fuselage showing the restricted view the pilot had in taking off. Note that the stress bar in the canopy is located actually underneath the plexiglass.

A FW 190 A prepares to take off. The journey near the wing roots are access panels to the breeches of the 20 mm MG 151 carmons.

A pilot performs his "Stitebreitschaft", or cockpit readiness. When the word is given he will take off, but until then or until relieved, he must remain in the cockpit. The small open access panel on the fuselage is the oxygen tank load where the oxygen bottles in the plane are refilled.

Prograting for an early morning flight. An interesting aid to the pilot is the small rod sticking up out of the wing's upper surface adjacent to each wheel, informing the pilot that the landing gear is extended.

A FW 190 A5 with fastage bomb shackles and open engine access panels.

In this view, the engine is being put back together. Note the lack of outer wing guns, which means that this is a FW 190 A-6.

A FW 190 A-5/U-8 with under wing drop tanks and a 500 lb. bomb mounted on the fuselage bomb rack.

FW 190s of 6./JG 3 with some 109Gs of the same group in the background on a field in Holland.

The armorers prepare to book another belt of ammunition to the one dangling from the wing. This FW 190 has had its wheel covers removed to prevent mud from gathering between the wheel and wheel cover.

A crash-handed FW 190. This aircraft will obviously never fly again.

In 1937 the first variants of the FW 200 appeared. Designed as a long distance passenger aircraft, it set World records with its early flights. In 1938 the "Condor" machines were exported to Denmark, followed shortly by export to Japan, Finland and other countries.

In 1940, conversion began on those machines in the country operated by Luffthans to military specifications. Three specially equipped aircraft were built: two for Hitter's personal use and one for offering.

Production of the FW 200 continued until 1944, the majority of the 262 "Condors" being used for cargo or troop transport. Long-range reconnaissance and bombardment and airborne guides for U-Boat "Moffpacks".

The "Jutlandia", the second FW 200 A to be sold to the Danish State airlines, in November of 1938. The aircraft featured 4 x 720 by radial engines, each turning a fixed pitch Hamilton Standard two-bladed propeller.

A FW 200 C-3 of Blindfugschule B-36 (Instrument Flying School B-36) at Gardelogein in 1942. Many of these living school FW 2008 were pressed into emergency service as cargo planes used to resupply German troops on the Eastern Front. The most notable use of these aircraft was their use at Stalingrad.

Ground crewmen manhandle a FW 200 C-4 reconnaissance bomber on to the apron at Bordenox-Mergiac. The aircraft is one of KG 40's planes, but does not carry the KG 40 "Globe" insignias. What appear to be machine gun which holes on the forward fatigue adjacent to the inboard engine, are distortions caused by the photographer during development.

A close shot of the BMW 323 R-2 engines on a FW 200 C-3. Just visible is the 20 mm gun in the central gondo which was fired by the bomb-shimer.

A FW 200 C-3 on a French airfield. Note the forward armament of the aircraft. The ventral gondoal features a forward firing 20 mm MG 151 and the dorsal turret houses the same type of 20 mm gun. The Heinkel He II in the background is preparing to shut down its engines.

A group of ground and air crew members looking on while a crew exits their ship. Noteworthy is the inconsistency in the uniform of the day, as well as the massive construction of the FW 200's undercarriage legs.

Another view of a KG 40 FW 200 C4 on the Bordesaux-Merignae runway. Later during the War, Heinkel He 177s were assigned to KG 40 to fulfill the same mission the FW 200 performed.

Another view of the same aircraft, F8 + KM, taken while in use as a cargo plane during the Depynasty battle in Russia. Note the yellow Twilage band denoting an aircraft operating on the Eastern Front. The very impressive fully sheet on this KG 40 aircraft shows around 38,000 tons of Allied shipping destroyed. This aircraft is believed to be one of the 2. 2008.

The insights of Instrument flying school B 36 as seen on the needle of port wing engine of a Ju 52. Although this school was located at Gardingen, near Maddburg, these aircraft were sometimes used as transports for partotoropes training nearby in the Letzlinger Heide Training area.

Lithvattative ambulance drivers pose by their mounts as a flight system in the cockpit of the Ju 52 pregents the aircraft for flight. The loop antenna of the direction finder and the air-driven generator and its small propeller may be seen on the top of the fuselage.

These Luftwaffe troops are unloading supplies from the side cargo door of this Jv 52. The officer on the far right is a captain and his flight suit indicates he may be the pilot of the aircraft.

A line-up of Ju 52s belonging to an unidentified training school. Placement of the swavits between the rudder and vertical stabilizer (as opposed to the entire swavitska on the vertical stabilizer) indicates that the aircraft is not assigned to an operational squadron.

Photographer from another Ju 52, this "Tante Ju" sweeps low over a Greek Orthodox church on its landing approach.

Ju 52s were not without some means of defense, as evident by this top gunner and his single MG 61 machine gun.

A study of camouflage and markings. These aircraft are loading up for a resupply mission on the Eastern Front. At least two white camouflaged Ju 52s are visible, plus one grey Luffmanns plane in military service, as well as a grey and green splitter painted Ju 52.

With the sun setting behind them, this group of Ju 52s keep to low altitude for protection while crossing the Mediterranean.

## DFS 230 Glider

Long before the War began, the Reich Air Ministry put forth proposals for cargo carrying gilders that could be towed behind passenger airfires and then cut loose over designated areas along the airline routes that were not served by the aircraft themselves. Cargo was to have been mainly letter mail and packages sent by air mail.

The pre-production versions of the DFS 230 were tested out by the framed agitarius Hama Reitsch, and were so successful that series production begun when the Luftawfelter realized the glider circuit as an air-landing weapon.

Almost all pre-jaming maneuvers involving gliders were carried out in great secrecy and this glider's first combat use came in May, 1940, during the assault on Fort Eben Emanuel in Belgium. Further combat use came about in Crete, North Africa and Italy.

The DFS 230 was built in three main versions. They were:

_DPS 230 A - I_ - The most common version, built in target quantity. First systems were equipped with a fixed landing gear while later versions had a jetintoshable landing gear while later the glider airborne. Landing was then carried out on a large solid which was mounted under the fusque. Aircraft used to tow the DFS 230 after the He 111, His 20, 52, 84 W and the He 110.

_DPS 230 B - I_ - This was almost two minutes on DFS 230 A - I which had interactive braking whilst the lower fludge and were used to be lowered when the glider came to landing on iv services so that the brakes would glider into the ice and the glider stop without having to kid a long distance.

_DPS 230 C -_ - This type was built especially for the rescue to Bento Mistoshi. The glider was equipped with three forward-fring braking robots on the fusque.

The DFS 230 A was constructed mainly of steel tubing, covered with fabric and featured a plywood nose and fusque bottom. The crew constituted of a pilot and gummer sitting in tandem with optional controls for the gummer, and could carry eight fully-equipped combat troopers.

Lufwaffe ground crewmen (the NCO looking into the cockpit is wearing a summer tuniel prepare to tour an early DFS 230 A back to the airfield after it has landed. This early version is distinguished from the later version by addition of extra window in the nose to allow the pilot better downward vision. The design on the nose is either a personal insignia or an asyet unidentified unit insignia.

This DFS 230 A is one of the gidiers that was to be used in the proposed air insulation of Mata, Note the color scheme of Green 71 upperurfaces and Blue 65 testing sides and undersurfaces.

 DFS 230 As on an airfield in Southern Italy. These gidiers were used in North Africa for carrying supplies and executing personnel to Italy. They feature a camporting of grey 75 oversurfaces, RIM Grey Q2 underurfaces and testing sides and grey 74 motting on the fuselig. Aircraft in the photo are coded LB + 194, LB + 192 and LB + 196.

Here a NCO pilot in flight suit shows his "office" to a NCO of one of the Filk units guarding the airfield. Note the 7.92 mm MG 81 machine gun on its mounting behind the pilot.

An armorer mounts the MG 81 into its swivel mount. All versions of the DFS 230 carried such armament and many such gliders attached to air-langing assault units mounted extra guns that could be fired by the pilot.

One the "men in black", a Lytwaffe ground crewman, attaching the tow cable with its release mechanism to the nose of a DFS 230 A assault glider. This aircraft is obviously fitted with forward firing machine gun brackets. If not, the function of the ring sight in front of the windshield escapes this writer.

A NCO pilot adjusts the MG 81 on its flexible mount. Visible in this photo is the rear view mirror which was sometimes the glider's only other means of defense. Often a forward firing MG 34 was mounted on brackets just below the canopy hinges. The gun was fed from a belt from within the canopy, and fired by means of a wire attached to the trigger, running into the canopy.

Ground crew men unravel the tow cable prior to hooking it to the towing attachment on a Ju 87 dive bomber's tail wheel.

In this photo, the tow cable may be seen strong out between the DFS 230 A glider and the Ju 87 R tow plane. The ground crew NCD in the foreground is tightening the retaining bolt with a wrench.

The Ju 87 R.3 tow plane begins it taxi to the runway before take-off. Both the Ju 87 R.3 and Ju 87 R.4 were fitted with glider tow attachments. Note the crew member in the foreground wearing a floatution set. The crew man sitting on the wing of the "Stalk" is helping to guide the aircraft as the pilot's visibility during take-offs was somewhat restricted by the plane's cowling.

Finally aloft, the Ju 87 R and its DFS 230 A mate, level off and head for their destination over the northwest German flatlands.

Prior to take off. With brakes on and throttle forward, the pilot res up his engine in order to lift the loaded glider he will be towing aloft.

Straining for altitude, the pilot of this Ju 87 R 3 applies full power to his engine. It is believed that these photos were taken in the Hannover-Magglotburg region of Northwest Germany, a prime area for such training.

Although the center engine had a "beerd", radiator, the engines mounted on the wing of the BV 138 B had their radiators mounted further back under the needle in a square shaped flaring. Notice the three bombs mounted under the wing.

Ground crewmen operate a beating unit which pumps hot air into the recess below the middle engine, allowing the engine components to have sufficiently before starting up.

In this view, mechanics are servicing the Jonkers Jumo 2095 D liquid-cooled diesel engine which put out around 700 hp. Note the ice on the upper surfaces of the aircraft. One may assume that the crewmen would rather be elsewhere.

The right-hand seat of the flying boat is occupied by the navigator who is plotting the course of the aircraft. Note the absence of another steering vote, indicating this aircraft could only be controlled by the man in the left seat.

The pilot's seat in the BV 138. This aircraft has a Revi gun sight fitted for the pilot's use. Note the excellent all around vision afforded to the pilot.

The radio man's position looking to the rear from the flight deck. Many BV 138s were equipped with transmitters and receivers to communicate not only with either home units, but also with things, submarries and ground units operating small portable tactical radio equipment. This radio man is in the process of tapping out a more message with the "bug" in his right hand.

This view shows to advantage the MG 131 mount. The two springs on the right served to aid the summer in elevating his weapon, as the entire gun and its mounting bar weighed quite a bit.

The upper rear gunner's position in the BV 138. His weapon is a 13 mm MG 131. The lower rear turner featured a 20 mm MG 151.

The upper rear gunner's position had almost unlimited visibility to the rear and sides, except for the twin booms and vertical stabilizers, which did pose a problem. Note the ring and bead sight on the gun barrel, through which the summer arms.
