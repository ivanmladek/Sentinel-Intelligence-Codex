## Introduction

The Douglas SBD Dauntless, the Slow But Deadly Dauntless, was easily the most famous US Navy bomber of World War 1, and possibly the most important dye bomber from my oral content during World War 1. However, the Dauntless had begun its combat career as a medicine dive bomter that was already considered obsolete even before the United States entered the war. Obsolescence not with standing, the Dauntless was the only US aircraft to participate in all five Naval engenders that were fought exclusively between aircraft carriers, and despite having been marked for retirement even before the war began, the Dauntless sunk motor enemy shipping during 1942 than all other aircraft combined; the Slow But Deadly destroyed the mean of the Japanese aircraft carrier-antifer fleet during the Battle of Midway, a blow from which the Imperial Japanese Jasper never recovered. "Certainly" by the time the definitely appeared on the scene the main decisive director-to-carrier airplane shutles had been fought and now, mainly by the combination of Dauntless/Averver/World, and there was little left left from 1943 onward but for the gradual moving up-up of a defeated army who would not admit as best.

The Dauntless story began in 1932, when the aviation genius John Northmore left supplies Auckland for them swim on many (with Douglas healthy at El Segundo, California). During the next few years Northmore turned out some truly remarkable designs in the Alpha which was first at all metal stressed skin monophase, the Beta flight flight which was the first 300 hj aircraft to exceed 200 mph, and the Gamma Mali plane which could by the metal coast to east in 111 12 hours, in response to a 1938 August Street For proposals from the Navy Bureau of Aeronautics (Buare) for a new purpose-built dye bomber to replace the numerous types then serving in the fleet they bomber's Northmore sub-heated a design proposal for an altenal stressed skin low wing monophase design. Buare chose the Northmore design ever times from Hewett, Martin and Vaopille because they were plunges, the Curtiss and Great Lakes designs had been rejected out of hand, ordering a single prototype from Northmore under the designation X8T-1 (BuNo 9745).

The X8T-1 (BuNo 9745) on 14 April 1938. The most noticeable feature of the new didebometer were the large underwriting faitings enclosing the partially retracting landing gear. (NASM)

Designed by Ed Heinemann, working directly under John Northmore, the X8T-1 prototype offered a number of features that were near state of the art in 1934. A buging monophane with a main landing gear that partially retracted rearwind into bugged underating faitings, which left the lower part of the tires exposed. Belgium that strength was the most important factor in a dive bomber, Heinemann employed the separates, multi-cellular wiring structure that Northmore had pioneered with his alpha trailers. The same setup that Douglas had used so successfully in its early DC transport series. When introduced, the multi-cellular design was revolutionary, because it allowed the construction of monophase wings without external braces or stays; However, because the multi-cellularity when design precluded the wing being folded, the X8T-1 was the only carrier aircraft with a multi-cellular wing construction ordered by the Navy. To construct make up for the lack of a driving wing, Huemanian take X8T-1 as small as could be. The wing span of the top three years last 14 at 16 feet inches with the other dimensions similarly dimituating, length = 31 feet inches and a height of 12 feet inches. When was provided by a 700 m Patt White White 1855-856 Watt 237, giving the prototype to a speed of 164 mB. The two types for the first time on 19 August 1935 providing monophane profiles for continuing to December of 1935, the X8T-1 was re-entioned with an 825 hp RAW 15:3594. Twin Wattay providing a top speed of 221 mB and the ability to carry a 500 kohm with a service ceiling of 2,500 kU. To solve a buffering problem during aging, a series of these were drilled in the five days. Not only was the buffering problem solved, but the flaps could be opened wider than ever, which further reduced diving speed, and did nothing to reduce the tilt of the airfoil.

On September 1936, the Navy accepted the X8T-1, ordering fifty-four production aircraft under the designation BT-1. Many serving with W56-2 outward surround W56-board flatterings, the new dye bomber was found to suffer from a catalog of including characteristics including lateral instability at low speeds, a loss of rudier and alten effectiveness at low speeds, and a tendency to snap roll if power was applied to suddenly, which caused several fatal crashes. Needless to say, BuAr wanted to more BT-1s.

With an enlarged tail anddesigned cowling, the BT-1 entered fleet service in 1938, **6.-B**-(BuNo BUS) sports a Royal Red cowling, **tuseing band** and wing cheuron. The True Blue tail identifies it as part of the Enterprise Air Group, and the charging ram insignia and code identifies it as a member of V8-6, 1938. (NASM)losa of resolving the many problems of the BT-1 and hopefully winning another production contract. Reasoning that most of the BT-1's problems stemmed from insufficient power, the first step was to change powerlaws. A 1000 by Wright XR-18232 cyclone engine replaced the Twin Wasy Jr and an adjustable pitch three bladed propeller replaced the two bladed propeller of the BT-1. A completely redesigned control panel and instrumentation was added to the machine to resolve its standing characteristics. Flight testing of the XBT-2 in this configuration began on 25 April 1993, revealing only marginal improvement over the BT-1.

Unifying to give up the effort, Northrop flew the XBT-2 to Langley, VA, where NACA had set up the first wind tunnel large enough to test full scale aircraft. The result was a series of recommended changes by NACA including the landing gear with iractactable, adding listed data to the wings to increase airborne effectiveness and increasing the size of the tail and radar. The changes were implemented by Heinemeyer, followed by six months of intensive testing during which at least 21 different tail and radar configuration and 12 different alertons were tried, before a totally satisfactory combination was found. Before the completely revised XBT-2 was rolled out John Northrop designed from Douglas this company to a number of years that been operating an an independent aircraft manufacturer which owned by Douglas). The XBT-2 reverted to Douglas, being redesignated the KSB0-1. As a result of the NACA recommendations the development was aerodynamics smoothed out. The most obvious thing the landing gear. Some were huge tairings into which the reward folding manager had partially retracted, being replaced by a fully retractable landing gear that had finally intact how well is the lower tiseable. The cockpit greenhouse was completely redesigned. The revised prototype was accepted by Buarzi in February of 1993, with 144 S818 being ordered on a April. The change in designation from Bomner (B) to Scott Bomber (SB) was made because Buar decided to reserve the bomber designation for multi-engine aircraft. It indicated no change in mission.

The XBT-2 (BuNo 0627) attempted to correct the many problems of the BT-1. With the larger diameter Wright Cyclone engine and fully retracting landing gear, the general shape of the boundaries was established. After further changes, particularly to tail and radar, it evolved into the XSB0-1. (NASM)

## SBD DevelopmentSBD-1

The shape of the cowling was further refined and a slightly bulbous catheter at intake was added to the two of the cowling. A signner was added to the propeller hub and the radio mast was moved eastward from the edge of the cowling to a position just in front of the firewall. The SBD-1 was armed with a pair of 50-cell machine guns buried in the fuseluge in run front of the windscreen, fitting through troughs in the cowling. The breachs of the machine guns protruded into the cockpit where they could easily be cleared and located 1 ifumed. The Dautlews' chief adversary, the Zero, had a similar arrangement for its fuseluge mounted amtment. The radio operator's position was equiped with a single 30-cell machine gun on a flexible mount that fired to the rear. Prohibs were made for a single bomb of up to 1000 kb on the centering and a single 100 kb of depth where under each wing. The centering bomb was mounted to a crutch which swaps down and forward emanating that the bomb cleared for propeller are.

Although 1480 SB-1 was correct, only 510 Busto 1986 1631, 1735 to 1758 were acquired delivered in the 1-configuration, because BuiEUR confected the first arm of the Dautlews to be something less than combat ready. Although armed, the SBD-1 lacked any amtored protection for the rear to fuel, and had not shown a range. The 210 gallos of test carried in four thanks in the wing center section, two 30 gallo main tanks and two 15 gallo main tanks, providing less than 900 annual miles of data with bomb load. Considering the time necessary to form up with other aircraft prior to a mission and time spent in the landing pattern upon return, and allowing fuel for combat and an adequate reserve, the SBD-1 had an effective combat radius of less than 200 nautical miles. Douglas assured BuiEUR that these problems would be solved, beginning with the SBM production aircraft. Therefore, BuiEUR detected to accept the first 57 aircraft as "is", and dispose of them in their normal fashion. They were given to the Manines.

The SBD-1 began to equip Marine Air Group (MAG) 11 and 21 during June of 1940, SBD-1 equipped MAG 21 was stationed in Hawaii at the time of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. Casupton on the ground, seventeen Dautlesses were destroyed with all of the remaining twelve being damaged.

## 5 Conclusion

In this paper, we have proposed a novel approach to the design of the new Sea Group carrying the new overall Light Gray scheme. SBD-2s were accepted for fleet service in early 1941 and immediately began replacing BT-1s, BSCs and SE210s on Lexington and Enterprise. As war approached, the Navy changed from its bright prewar mathings to camouflage. The first change was the adoption, in late 1940, of overall Light Gray as the basic plant scheme for combat aircraft. Markings were White and rounds were carried in four positions both sides of the fuselage, and upper port and lower starboard wing surfaces. (USNNHRC)

(USNNHRC)As the Navy took stock of its new situation in early 1942, it was obvious that any often-site action would have to come from the carrier force. The anger after Pearl Harbor made counterbacks psychologically, if not initially, important. The result was the "Response Rails" of early 1942. This deck cersrum puts the finishing touches to 513 of 153 of V5-6 on the Enterprise during January of 1942 while amorato to the first of those rails. Compilants about "friendfly" the fed led on order for the enlargement of all national insigning during January 1942. At the same time, the squadron number was ordered removed from a-rent cooks. (NASA)

The first "Reverage Rails" sent Halsey's TFR against the Kwajetlein area on 1 February 1942. As Enterprise was riting, five Betty's attacked. AMM Bruno Galads joined into the "winners" set of 55 to add and additional 30 to the defense. One of the Betty, possibly damaged, dried into the ship in probably the first kamkaze attack of the war. It grazed the Enterprise and cut the tail off of 55 not four ten from where Galads sat firing. Galads was unburt. (USNAAW)Battle of the Coral Sea

The Enterprise, Lexington and Yorktown spent the months immediately following the attack on Pearl Harbor carrying out that and run raads on rafting Japanese positions. And while little real damage was done, it served to let the Japanese know that the US Navy was still in the Pacific and allowed the Stur Bod Derby time to perfect its Pat. During the late spring of 1942 Allied intelligence determined that the Japanese were about to launch an attack to take port Rossby in New Guinea. If successful, Australia would be jeopardized. During the first week in May Lesington and Enterprise moved to block the Japanese move on Port Mversely. During the ensuing engagement, which became known as the Battle of the Coral Sea, the Stur Bod Derby was conducted with sinking the small carrier Shoko on the Tidy of the Maryland as the theater after Shoko on the Right, And although Lexington was lost, the Battle was considered a tactical draw; the US lost more ships but the Japanese lost more planes and pilots. Strategically, however, the Battle of the Coral Sea could only be considered a major USI victory -- the Japanese advance in the Pacific was equipped. The Japanese, believing that both Yorktown and Lexington had been sunk, retired from the battle congratulating themselves on another defeat of the US Navy.

Reaching front line units during the late spring of 1942, the SBD-3 was originally ordered by the French who had witnessed the destructive power of the development during the German invasion of Poland. In the event, an 1174 machines ordered for the Aeronautical plus an additional 410 SBD-3s were delivered to the US Navy (BuNo 4518 to 4691, 03185 to 03384, 06492 to 06791).

The SBD-3 variant mainly brought the Dauauiness up to combat standards. Self-seasing fuel tanks (all in the wings with a capacity of 260 gations), crew amor, and an armored windscreen were introduced in the SBD-3. This additional equipment brought a further increase in weight and a further reduction in performance. In an attempt to prevent further performance degradation, lighter alcalcal produced the dual stathing of earlier variants, and all floatation equipment was removed. The cost mounted forward firing machine gun that was usually deleted on the SBD-3 was officially reinstated on the SBD-3. Full firepower being considered more important than the weight savings. A new model of the Wright Cyclone, the R-1820G2, replaced the similarly powered R-1820G2 engine used on previous models, and the engine ventilation slot of the ceiling was slightly enlarged with a fixed opening. The net result of these changes was an increase in amply weight, (5625 ms to 6160 ms) and a marginal drop in performance, "clean" top speed fell from 256 to 253 mph. During the course of SBD-3 production, a twin 3.0 called flexible machine gun repeated the single 30 cylinder flexible machine gun in the radio generator's position. The new twin 30s were covered by a pair of sliding panels which replaced the earlier doors that had covered the single machine gun's storage trough.

A-24 Banshe

The US Army Air Corps only belatedly took an active interest in disbumbing, prompted mainly by the German success with their Stukas during the French Campaign. Lacking the time and expertise to develop their own design, the Army turned to existing Navy air-class of fill its needs. Specifically, the Army Air Corps requested and received its 88D3-s and from the Navy production order. Under the designation A-24-DE an 41-15748 to 156238 and 42662 to 67017, the Army version offered from the Beau Beauties, aside from electronics, on-1 by minor features. The lithodox asked telegraphed though not the actuator lifting/ending and a larger pneumatic tailwheel replaced the Navy's solid rubber wheel. The A-24 was intended only as an interim stepkeeper, to be used mainly for training. Army Air Corps planned to use the CSHS26 helicopter Curtis A-25 as has team equivalent.

During November of 1941 thirty-two-A26 were shipped by sea to the 27th Bombardment Group in the Philippines. However, when the Japanese located the Philippines, the A-24s were diverted to Australia where they were taken over by the 91st Bombardment System. The 91st Bombardment is operated to the Dutch East indises where they operated the A-24 with a spectacular lack of success. The 9th Bombardment Group, operating the A-24, torn Australia, did no better, on 29 July 1942 season A-24s on a bombing mission to Buna, were interpreted by Zeros, only one returned. The A-24 Banshe was subsequently withdrawn from frontline service.

Moway Island

109 Aircraft

And perhaps most importantly, allied intelligence had provided Admiral Nimitz, Commander-in-chief Pacific Fleet, with detailed knowledge of the Japanese battle plans, including selling times of ships.

Between 3 and 7 June the Japanese Northern Force carried out diversionary attacks in the Aleutaries. Aware of the diversion, American forces did not respond, but continued to close on Milway.

At 4030 on the morning of 4 June, Vice Admiral Nim launched a strike on the Midway island detresses. Since only one land strike was anticipated, the second wave of aircraft were sitting on the carrier decks almost with trippedes and armor piercing bomts to ward off any nasal response to the air attack. However, US land based planes rose from Midway to attack both the bombers and the carrier force, and while no damage was done, if forced the strike command to call for a second strike, thereby starting a chain of events that would lead to disaster for the Japanese. Admiral Nimay oordered the armorers to begin the laborious hour logs of returning the sequence was aircraft with high explosive and fragmentation bomts for a second strike on Midway. Half way through the Farming, or 4782, Naga recently worked at what a US force of ten ships has been sightled. No mention of an aircraft at order of 2786 free opera in that US to force make up of the curbers and the destroying. Almost immediately Nagaury's carriers came under attack from Midway based aircraft, slowing down the final rearmment. The land based aircraft did no damage but it did force the carriers to send up all their Zeros to peel the attack.

At 4028 Nayo occupied the message that there "appears" to be a carrier with the US force. A strike on the US carry could receive the Japanese armors to begin the process all over again - removing the high explosive and fragmentation land bomts and then return the bombers with undergo and armor piercing bomts. A strike on the An Beautures of US-5 formerly US-3, appears to launch from Yoktown on a June 1942. VB-3, Saratoga's bombing squadron, in order to make good the heavy losses sustained at Coral Sea, moved to Yorktown just prior to the Battle of Midway. VB-3 a bomber squadron was designated Scoutron Five (VS-9) to avoid the confusion of having two bombing squadrons onboard. (USIN/NARS)American carrier would need tighter cover, but the Zeros needed to be rearmed and reueled after having repelled the land based attack; and at 0830 the Midway strike aircraft also be returning -- but nearly exhausted -- needing immediate recovery. Maguno decided to postpone preparing the strike aircraft until after recovery of the Midway strike force, he did take the precaution of changing country by 06 degrees.

At 0752 strikes had been launched against Naguno's carriers from both the Enterprise and Hornet, and at 0800 the Yorkinson launched its strike force at the Japanese carriers. Each strike force was made up of 580 Damelsels' feedbacks, TDD devastator toprogles and fer-AF Wilcott fighters. Because of Naguno's change in course, the SBDs off the Hornet missed finding the Japanese carriers and had to turn back, By 0803, of the GSFB solely launched, only fifty wire exit in the air and a Saturday of Naguno's carriers. Between 8018 and 1010 the Home Dresset barrier toprogles oxidous found and attached the carriers. Without fighter cover the POPs were slauged by the defending fighters and flack. Of the fottw for toprogles toprogles bombners, only four returned. Naguno, pleased with its defenses, continued with the resarming of this strike aircraft, This was completed at 1025.

As the Japanese carriers, their decks packed with armed and fueled aircraft ready to date off, dodge the last TBDs, fifty SBD Dounels' feedbacks arrived overhead. Unopposed by fighters, that had been pulled down to water layer by the toprogles bonded attacks, the IDED businesses peeled off, one after the other in near vertical votes. When the Dounelsels pulled out of their dives, the Atagl, the Kaga, and the Soryu were burning trails, it was 1028.

The Hrup, cruising separately and undamaged, launched her strike as planned, hitting the Yorktown heated between 1200 and 1430 hours. The Yorktown had to be abandoned at 1500. At the same time, strikes were being carried out against the Hrup by Dounels' forces from the Enterprise, including fourteen "orphas" from the Yorktown, leaving the Japanese burning out of control at 1700. The Hrup was scottled the next day. Within a few minutes the Shou Slow Dead destroyed 47 percent of the Imperial fienti's aircraft carrier tromage, changed the course of the Pacific war, and won what many historians have claimed was one of the ten most important battles in world history.

### Sbd-5

The SBD-5 variant, brought the Dauntless a much needed, but hardly adequate increase in power, with the installation of a 1200 bp R-1802.60 Cyclone engine. However, due to an increase in equipment, to speed was increased by only 7 m and cruise speed actually decreased. External changes included the deletion of the extraterater air intake scope, reduction of count flags to one each side, and an arrangement and relocation at all of the remaining ventilation such. The attack telescope sight was finally replaced by a reflector point. Weipat this were provided on the wings to a pair of 85 gallo photo tracks which in increased reconnaissance range 130 to 1340 australes. The SBD-5 became the main problem solution with 1096 Bellog produced (Bouch 19807 to 11060, 20869, 2013, 35922 to 2014, 35943, 36936, 30632) and 50150 Agnol 55499 between February 1943 and April 1944. Douglas also produced 615 mChutes for the Army under the designation A4248 (in 42:42:42:45:16 5489). Sixty in the A4288 were further detected surplus by the Army; taken over by the Navy, they were eventually turned over to the Marines.

SBD-5s was common in large numbers, quickly replacing older models during the course of 1943. It was the SBD-5 that invented the fleet's attack quadrupons when the fleet earns resumed their fading during the latter half of 1943, had been planned that the SEB-5s have received no vehicle by the Dauntless dump 1943, but delays in the Heidler program caused the Slow But Deadly to remain at the forefront of the battle throughout 1943 and the 1944. During the course of 1944 the Curtiss SBD-5s Heidler writer quickly replaced the Slow But Deadly in fleet service. No longer able to operate from the decks of the carriers the Dauntless moved to land bases where it continued to give an account of itself at the expense of the enemy.

The SBD-5 prototype was an SBD-4 fitted with an uprated R-1803-60 Cyclone engine engine measured inside a smooth cowling with only one cowt flap and a longer, relocated at ventilation slot. (USN/ARS)SBD-5s of VB-10 patrol over the Enterprise at the time of the Palaay raids, 28-30 March 1944. During this period, late 1943 to early 1944, the number of carriers involved in any operation was still small, so the need for distinctive markings had not yet arisen, which made for very little variation from official markings standards. (USA/IARAS & RASM)(Above) Hit by Iak over Palau, this SBD-5 of VB-10 off the Enterprise developed an oil leak which has coated the windscreen. The gunner has already jettinessed his guns and is bus-by looking for other weight to pitch overboard. (Below) The leaking oil has coated the entire upper half of the Daunites which continues to lose power and altitude. (Right) The struggle to stay airborne lost. The Daunites has been successfully defined and the pilot and gunner are abandoning ship. They were both rescued, 29 March 1944. (USN/NAKS & NASSM)

About as fancy as Army Dauntisessess ever got, this A-24B carries the emblem of Air Transport Command on its side. All tail markings are Yellow and the serial number is repeated in Yellow under the port wing. (USAF)

The last Dauntless variant, externally indistinguishable from the SBD-5, saw a further increase in power with the installation of a 1350 B-R1200B-65 cyclone engine. However, this increase in power ony increased fog speed to 262 mph, too small an increase and too far below the standards of 1943 to satisfy Navy requirements. The metal total tanks with self sealing lines were replaced by non-metallic self sealing fuel tanks. Only 450 proto- tion 8BD-6s were completed (Buhko 56400 to 56540) before all remaining orders were cancelled, by the time the first production SBD-6 was delivered on 18 March 1944 it was effectively obsolete, so nearly all -6s were retained stateside for use by coastal patrol squadars, as trainers for bomber squadars, as target tugs, or as hacks.

The X8BD-6 (Buhko 28830) seen at NATC Paltavent River on 22 June 1944. This airframe was pulled out of the SBD-5 production sequence and upgraded with the more powerful 1200 B-R130-60 cyclone engine of the SBD-6. The letters PT, which are faintly visible on the nose, indicate that this is a flight test airframe. (OwnNANS)

An SBD-6 equipped with 58 gallon drop tanks is parked on the ramp at El Segundo on 11 April 1944. These aluminum drop tanks extended the scouting range of the Dauntless to 1340 nautical miles. (USNNARS)
