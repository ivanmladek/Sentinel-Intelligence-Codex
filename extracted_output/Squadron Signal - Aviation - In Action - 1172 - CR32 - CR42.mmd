## Fiat Cr 32

Study after the design of the FIAT CR 30 had been finalized, Roatelli began design work on the CR 32. The CR 32 was, for the most part, a smaller version of the earlier CR 30, which took advantage of additional wind tunnel testing to further refine the earlier design. The _Minister_ of _Accretion_ (Italian Air Ministry) ordered the construction of an experimental prototype which was to be completed in the spring of 1933. Roatelli's new fighter fully met its expectations and demonstrated exceptional stability. After successfully completing its first test rights, the CR 32 NC 1 (MM. 201) was transferred to the Experimental Unit for further evaluation. The _Minister_ of the target one by the time most spaciation in 1934.

The CR 32 retained the liquid-cooled, 1-cylinder HAT A30 RA engine used its predecessor. Although the engine was slightly improved, it still developed its original 59/9 net at 8530 feet (2600 s) at 2750 rpm. The engine turned a two-bladed, dual pitch (ground adjustable) HAT metal pepper.

The new CR 32 also retained most, if not all, of the aerodynamic and structural features of the earlier CR 30 with the exception of size. The length was reduced to 24 feet 52.5 inches (7.45 \(\mu\)m), while the wing was exposed to 31 feet 2 inches (5.35 \(\mu\)m). The wing wing area was reduced from 29.117 (7.27 (2.03 \(\mu\)m) to 23.89 \(\mu\)m) (22.13 \(\mu\)m). Despite the smaller size and similar construction, the CR 32's empty weight rose to 3205 (18453.8 \(\mu\)m) -- an increase of 240 lies (108.9 \(\mu\)m).

The fuselage structure was built of drumham tubing and consisted of four longens connected by a triangular framework with U-section strings supported by shaped, sheet aluminum forms. The joints and spur joints of the fuselage were made of steel. The forward part of the fuselage from the engine to the cockpit, the entire power fuselage docking, and around the tail wheel mounting structure was covered by light aluminum panels. The remainder of the fuselage was fabric covered. A circular thin intake clouder air to the oil and coolant radiances mounted on the engine barently beneath the engine. The oil tank was mounted in the extreme upper nose and exposed by a stress of 42 cooling firms -- 21 per side. A 90 gall (340.7 \(\mu\)m) to fuel tank was mounted behind the engine firewall and in front of the cockpit. The open cockpit was equipped with standard instrumentation and an in-flight adjustable seat.

The wings were built using two years of drumham tubing of rectangular section and of this square aluminum tube. Alchens were incorporated into the upper wing. These were augmented by a set of bench-type boost alcors mounted above the upper wing. A central but finite faning built into the center section of the upper wing comu (40.6 \(\mu\)m) (25 \(\mu\)m) was partially taller. The upper wing was staggered forward by 9\(\times\)90. Both wings were fabric covered. The wings were supported by Warren Tress steel stratus attached to the two main spurs in each wing. A set of N-type cabane status bracket the upper wing center section to the fuselage.

The tail surfaces were also made of drumham construction covered by fabric. The variable-inchede tailplane could be adjusted using a hand mounted on the port side of the cockpit. The header and elevator were both statically and aerodynamically balanced.

The fixed, split-safe train undercarcarcarcar incorporated two main legs attached to the front fructose. The 31.5 inch (800 s) balloon times were equipped with pneumatic brakes and hydraulic shock absorbers. The wheels were covered by streamlined aluminum wheel fariings. The pneumatic brakes were supplied by a compressed air tank located behind and to the right of the pilot's seat.

The CR 32 employed a 700 bp FAT A33 R.C.3 engine on a CR 2 32 aftername. From for the first time in 1937, this aircraft employed a three-bladed propeller and modified landing gear starts. A 7.7km machine gain was mounted in each tower wing. The CR 33 reached a maximum speed of 225 mph (21.6 km) in tests, however, this aircraft did not enter operational service. (Punka)

On the upper surface of each lower wing. Apart from detail changes, the CR 32bis was also equipped with an aprated FAT A30 Rabis engine, Despite the additional power, the added weight of the wing machine gums and ammonium were detrimental to the CR 32 maneuverability and speed. CR 32bis reduction began in 1936 and amounted to 283 machines. Many were exported to Austria, China, Hungary, Parayay, and Spain.

For 2bis production was halted in July of 1937 in favor of the improved CR **32ber**. Combit experience in Spain had convinced many pilots that the two oval mounted 12.78th machine gains offered sufficient firepower. CR 32fe filters reserved for the entire two-gain armment and had a highly modified underwater. Later production was mounted to attachment points under the fuselage for 12 five port (2.36x), two 100 lb (45.4 x0) bots, one 200 lb (00.7 x0) bots, and one 200 lb (00.7 x0) bots, CR 32ter production monitored to 130 machines before production used in December of 1937.

The FAT **32baquer** represented the final and definitive example of the CR 32 series fighter. The "water" teamed the armment and bomb carrying capability of the CR 32zer in addition to receiving further improvements to the landing gear, gumsht, and cockpit instrumentation. Italian manufacture of the CR 32baquer came to 337 machines before production halted in the fall of 1939. A small number of 'quaters' were exported to Parayay and Venezuela. A further 100 machines have licensed produced in Spain by Hispanic-Suzia as the H3-12-Clrrrr ("Cricket also, CR in Italian). These fisheries -- some converted to two-seiners -- reminded in service up to 1953. Total production of the CR 32 series amounted to some 1152 machines.

The Ch 32 coorbit was fairly standard for its time, with most controls mounted on the tubular fusage action. The Ch 32 aquart instrument panel is mounted on the coorbit frames and painted flat black. The top row of flight instruments are (L-H): fuel pressure gauge; water and _all_ thermometer: air speed indicator; rate of climb indicator; another air speed indicator; a level indicator. The instruments on the bottom row are: oil pressure gauge; fuel warning light; stochometer; turn and bank indicator; and altimeter. The telescoping guangiris mounted above the black-graded coorbit coming while the guntight headstar is mounted at the top of the unshielded. The Ch 32 coorbit is mounted below the guntight, farested by the machine gun cooking handles. The control stick tip is visible immediately above the turn and mark indicator. The bottom on top of the control stick tip triggers the fighter's two 12-Turk Break-S4FAT machine guns. The engine printing handle is located in the lower left corner of the instrument panel.

Captana Morota and Narciso Bermudez de Castro, and Li Diaz-Regunnea.

Morota would shoot down 41 aircraft in 80 engagements during the war to become the conflict's leading air ace. He became Commander in Chief of the Nationals Air Force by the end of 1983. Morota was killed in a flying accident on 4 April 1939 -- one week after the Spanish Civil War ended.

The _Axixiocian Legoniator's_ CR 32 units were National National and Italian units figning on the Madrid front in central Spain during February and March of 1937. Three CR 32s were analyzed after their pilots mistakenly landed on Republican-held airfields, and the aircraft subsequently taken into Republican service. This resulted in an order from _Axiocian Legoniator's_ commander _Greenatic de Birique_ Aviation Federal for CR 32 units not to cross into Republican air space. The incident also hasened the equipment of Spanish units with these aircraft. The first full-Spanish CR 32 square. I-E.S.Scandrilia, was formed with six aircraft on 30 March 1937. A second squadron was formed one month later, and these two were were turned into 2-G.3 _Grupa_ at May. _Capinion_ Metro commated this first all-Spanish Nationalist fighter. This unit was joined by two realitan CR 32 groups, 6 _Grupa_ (_17_, _32_, and _35_, _Sandrilia_) and 23 _Grupa_ (_18_, _19_, and _20_, _Sandrilia_).

The Nationals CR 32 units participated in air operations over the Madrid and Amazon fions during the spring and summer of 1937. Republican air finds on Palma Malicora- an island of Spain's southeast coast -- resulted in the formation of _10\({}^{\circ}\)Grupa Autonomica Caccia della Bacteri_ (10th Iba-Derbenar Fighter Group of the Balaciers) during November of 1937. This new RC 32 unit consisted of _10\({}^{\circ}\)I_ and _10\({}^{\circ}\)I_ (_20\({}^{\circ}\)Sandrilia_) and was based at San Juan, Malocca, and A second Spanish CR 32 group, 3-G.3, was formed at the beginning of 1938 and operated in the Battle of Teruel being fought at that time. The _Axiocian Legoniator_ showed increased 12 CR 32s aircraft to equip the _Sandrilia Latino Minotamento's Greece_ (Arrows). This unit,

CR 32 were heavily involved in the Battle of the Ebro, which began on the evening of 24-25 July 1938 with a Republican attack across the Ebro River Air burdies fought over the Ebro travel weekly up to 250 micron north to both sides. These were the largest air chokes seen up to that time in history. The Italians disab

## The CR 32 in the Soviet Union

One HAT CR 32bis was captured by Republican forces during the Spanish Civil War and sent to the Soviet Union in 1937. This aircraft five simulated dogprints against a Polikarpov I. 15 -- one of the CR 325's opponents in Spain -- at the Scientific Research Institute of the (Soviet) Air Forces. The evaluation demonstrated the Italian fighter's raefficity in time-to-c climb and maneuverability. The Soviet's also found taking off in the CR 32bis to be difficult, and high pile- skills were required to perform such aerobatic maneuvers as the'spill' S' comparator to the L-15. The Italian aircraft demonstrated a more superiorament than its Soviet adversary did. This advantage allowed CR 32bis polts to engage I-15 s at a greater range than was possible with the Soviet fighter. The Soviet test plots found the CR 32bis's to improbile to realize during combat due to that aircraft's inferior speed and time-to-climb.

## The CR 32 in Austrian Service

The Austrian Federal Ministry of National Defense ordered 45 CR 32bis aircraft at the beginning of 1936. These figures were used to equip a new fighter using, _Jaggeleschwalter II_. The wing was used at Weiner Newsat and consisted of three quadjets. _Jaggeleschwalter III_, _Stil_, and _607_. The CR 32s were impressed in the Luftarkfer service upon the German _Asculkes_ (Ameculation) of Austria on 13 March 1938. _Jaggeleschwalter II_ was redesignated \(I\). _Gingeringer/Jaggeleschwalter 138_ Ast Aspern, however, the CR 32bis could be integrated into the Luftark as front the flights due to their incompability with existing German equipment. Following brief service as fighter trainers, the 36 remaining CR 32bis fibers were sold to Hungary.

The CR 32 was the largest single fighter aircraft type in the _Regia Aeronautica_ (RA) when July entered World War Two on 10 June 1940. The 294 machines -- more than one quarter of Italy's fighter strength -- equipped eight (Groups) and four _Sparafier_ (Squarafier) In Italy, Atlanta, Libya, Italian Est Est Africa, and Rhodes in the Aegena Sea. The RA's other 368 fibers consisted of HAT CR 42s, HAT G 50, and Mochi MC 2008.

The RA's basic tactical unit was the _Norm_ (Wimp), composed of two _Grapich_ _Eabor Group_ (Acacia (Pigtor Group) consisted of three _Sparafier_, equipped with six tin aircraft. There

The CR 32 units stationed in Libya and Italian East Africa -- Abyssinia (Ethiopia), Ettrica, and Italian Small -- were primarily equipped with the CR 320mter. These meant were equipped with a supplemental radiator to provide increased engine cooling under desert conditions. Most of these CR 32s were also fitted with racks under the fuselage for bombs weighing up to 220.5s (100 xc). These aircraft were employed in close air support missions and proved particularly useful in attacking British armored vehicles. Few CR 32s however, were equipped with two-way radios and this limited their ability to respond to changing tactical situations. The British offensive in December of 1940 routed the Italians in North Africa and maintained the CR 32s stationed there.

The CR 32s of _410 and 411 Separatific_ in Italian Est Africa flew fighter, assault, and reconnaissance missions against the advancing British forces during the first half of 1941.

_At 1940 Superstailing_ claimed 14 British aircraft shot down by mid-April, when the Italians in Est Africa were reduced to operational CR 32.

While the fighting in Africa took place, other _Regia Aeronautica_ CR 32s was taken over the Mediterranean Sea and the Greek-Achima Front. Beginning in June 1940, aircraft of 30\({}^{\circ}\),grogroo, based at Agibero on Sardinia, defended the portal of Capiliar and flewber second and maritime attacks missions.

### The CR 32 in Hungarian Service

Hungary -- forbidden to have an air force following its defeat in World War One -- purchased 12 unarmed HATC CR 2008is fibers in 1931. These aircraft, and four CR 2008 trainers that soon followed, were given Hungarian civil registrations. The CR 208 were assigned to I. Meteorological Group, the cover name for the _171_. _undiscayal_ (Higher Squadron) based at Zimbabwe in western Hungary. During 1934 these fibers were armed with two Hungarian- and 7920AR 2631 M.G. With the Web Ghebauer machine guns.

Following the signing of the Rome Protocol with Italy in 1935, the _Magozr Legies Hristal_ (Hungarian Aviation Department) ordered 26 CR 328 and 26 more the following year. The 52 aircraft arrived in Hungary between 23 April and 2 December 1936. These CR 32 were soon armed with two 7.923at Gebauer machine guns. The figures were assigned to I. Meteorological Group, which was moved from Southwind to 2636kesterhexane during 1936. The group was composed of three sub-groups (quaditors): _101_. _714_ (Aberber): _I/2_. _Ladas Maji_ (Matiet the Goose Boy, a Hungarian fokhloe character) and _1/3_. _Punz_ (Mountain Lion).

On 22 August 1938 an agreement was signed in Bied, Yugoslav by Hungary and the 'Little Eletter States' -- Czechsokius, Romania, and Yugoslav. This agreement recognized Hungary's right to merit in exchange for Hungary's promise not to forby reclaim territory lost under the 1920 Peace Treaty of Tirano. The now legal Royal Hungarian Air Force (RHAF) went on water during the Munich Crisis in October of 1938, On 25 March 1938 -- following Germany's seizure of Beenham and Moravian -- Hungary reocowled the eastern Slovakia province of Upper Hungary (Ruthenium). Slovak aircraft attacked the advancing Hungarian troops through the RHAF into auction the next (or 832 of _71-764_) and _1/2_. _Ladas Maji_ (Matiet) guardages Slovak Avivi B 534 flight-resresive over Ruhten and Hungary on 24 March. During the morning "Iblaj", aircraft concentrated by 8348 over 160busbus Siskan Nova V5, Slovakia. The Hungarian-changed three Slovak aircraft -- one which was destroyed on landing and another covered after landing in Hungarian territory -- without any two. Nine FAIs from 'false' squadron stacked by Siskan at the Loreto Sky 382shops were synded. The CR 32 blocks claimed seven Slovak aircraft that down of which five were confirmed for no loss on their side.

Hungary allowed German to trace out Slovakia Slovakia from Hungarian territory on 4 April 1941. One week later, Hungarian troops advanced into northern Yugoslav. CR 32s of _1/1_. _1/2_. _Punz_'spandator sotonlenglobed's CR 32s were assigned to 1/2_. _Punz_'spandator sotonlenglobed's CR 32s were assigned to 1/2_.

## FIAT CR 40/CR 40bis

During the early 1930s the Italian Air Ministry examined the use of air-cooled radial engines in higher aircraft. Such engines were less vulnerable to battle damage than liquid-cooled engines used by the CR 30 and CR 32. FIAT's response to this suggestion was to develop the CR 40, a derivative of the CR 32 powered by a 550 hpistol **Mercury IVA** radial engine. _Ingev_ (Engineer) Celestion Rosestell developed a new pull using intended to improve pilot visibility, while retaining the CR 32's foresee, tail, and undercarriage. The dual sparss, ribs, and fake ribs were covered with sheet metal on the forward fuselage and cloth elsewhere on the airframe. This aircraft reached the CR 32's armament of two fuselage mounted 12.7mm Brends-Safar AT machine guns with 600 rounds of ammunition per gun.

The CR 40 prototype (MLM 202) was completed in early 1934 and flight tests under _Comantance_ Francesco Brack-Papa began at the end of March. The CR 40's top speed at 23.6 m mph (372.8 mm) was only slightly faster than the CR 32's 233 mph (375.8 mm). Additionally, the new CR 40 possessed inferior climbing performance and stability compared to the CR 32. The lone CR 40 built ranged in 1935.

The CR **40bis** retained the CR 40's airframe while substituting a 700 hp FIAT **A.59R** engine. This nine-cylinder radial engine was based on the Pratt & Whitney Homet SDG; however, the FAIT Overspatt generated nearly 200 hp more than the American engine: The single CR 40bis fleve a series of engine test flights between 1936 and 1937, but no further CR 40bis' were built.

## FIAT CR 41

Another forward step in the experimental radial enginel CR series was the CR 41. This right-er used a modified CR 40 airframe powered by a 729 hp Gmome-Rhoe **Mistral Major 148xf** engine. This 14-cylinder, double row engine was manufactured under license by FIAT, and was regarded as the best engine in its category. The CR 41 also featured a three-blended periler, wing-mounted machine guns, and an enlarged vertical stabilizer and motor.

The CR 41 made its first flight in 1936, a few days after the debut of the CR 40bis. Test flights were flown with the CR 41 employing two-bladed and three-bladed propellers. This air-carl reached a maximum speed of 248 mph (399.1 km). Despite this performance increase, the CR 41 was cancelled that year due to the development of the CR 42 underway in the Technical Office of _Ingev_ Rosestelli.

## FIAT CR 42 Falco

Test pilot _Comandance_ Valenting Cas took the FIAT **CR 42** prototype up on its first flight on 23 May 1938. After the first three hours of flight testing, Cas described the new fighter as _"the alaiming pilot" aerplane."_ The test program was conducted at a rapid pace with minor problems being rapidly solved. Some revisions included rearranging instrumentation and ancillary controls, replacing the retrenticule all wheel with a fixed unit, and shortening the exhaust pipes.

Following completion of the acceptance program, the _Ministero del!" Aeronautica_ (Italian Air Ministry) awarded FIAT an initial production contract for 200 CR 42s. This procurement plan allowed for the re-equimment or establishment of three _Grapei_ (Groups) and four _Scorni_ (Wings) with the new fighter.

Several foreign technical missions arrived in Turin - where the CR 42 tests took place -- during the summer of 1938. These decisions from Bolivia, Brazil, Bulgaria, Hungary, Japan, and Portugal arranged for experimental flights using their own pilots. Their interest in the 42 was stimulated by the success of the extract CR 32 in the sites of space.

The CR 42 Falco (Falco) was powered by the new 846 BFIAT **7.4A.6C.8** radial engine. This twin-eye engine was derived from Ghone-Rhone designs and drove three-blacked FIAT-Hamilton 3D constant speed metal propeller. The engine turned the propeller at 2500 rpm for three minutes at maximum messenger power and was rated at 4828 Bps at 12.468 (3799 s).

The Falco's structure sesquipane layout followed that of Rosatielli's earlier fighter designs, including the CR 32. The fabric-covered wings employed double spars and ribs made from light along and steel, with metal leaking edge slins. The dual-framed elements were also covered in fabric and were installed only on the upper wing. The upper wing was constructed in two halves joined along the feselice centering to inverted-vec equine struts, while the lower wing was attached to the bottom fuselice loopers.

The feselice structure consisted of triangulated frameworks built from manganese-molybdenum steel tubing. Light aluminum panels covered the forward fuselage to a point immediately behind the cockpit, the dorsal docking between the cockpit and tail, and the cut. The site was designed to fabric. The tail surfaces employed duxhmin framing with metal coverage on the horizontal and vertical stabilizers. The ruder and elevators were covered in fabric with metal elevator tubes.

The undercaririage was attached to the main spur of the lower wing stub, and featured oleo-premumative dampers and compressed air brakes. Streamlined farriving covered the gear legs and wheels. Another farriving covered the fixed hullwheel.

Initial production CR 42s differed from the prototypes in a number of areas. These included a reconduced catheter air intake lip, the introduction of small rocker arm bitisers on the engine cowling, a redesign of the propeller control housing, and replacement of the prototype's retractable ulinkwell with a fixed unit.

Fuel was continued in a 91 gallon (344.5 t) main tank installed behind the engine firewall. A supplemental 28.6 gallon (108.3 t) fuel tank was placed beneath the amminution container.

The CR 42's a ramament consisted of two 12.7mBroh-SAFAT machine guns installed in front of the cockpit and synchronized to free through the propeller disc. Either or both of theseguns could be replaced with a 7.7M Breda-SAFAT weapon. This replacement was performed at unit level to slightly reduce the aircraft's weight. The amminution bias could accommodate up to 400 rounds per spin. A round expenditure curve was installed on the instrument panel and a San Grigio Tape 2 P.B redder color gun with was fitted. No radio was fitted for the pilot.

Various modifications were made to the CR 428 beginning in 1914. The first modification consisted of installing light bomb cnics in aircraft that well. These reads could carry bushing weighing up to 220.5s (100 x.b). The ground attack role became an important factor in CR 42 operations in North Africa. This modified aircraft, also equipped with safe filter under the engine, was designed for 42AS (_Africa Stictictictic_). With Africa, it was believed that some ground attack CR 42s were equipped with two 12.7M machine guns or 20k manmade under the wings; however, there is no evidence supporting the claim. Several crack sizes modelled with an internal auxiliary field tank for operating against Crete. These aircraft received the designation CR 4269 (Acegan).

Another specialized version of the aircraft was the CR 42CN (_Caccia Montana_. Night Fighter) for home defense duties. The CR 42CN was equipped with exhaust flame dampers, augmented instrumentation, and a two-way radio for night flying. This variant was also fitted with two small exempliths mounted beneath the lower wing. An aircraft-driven generator, mounted on the upper wing center section, powered the lights.

A total of 176 CR 42 Falcus were produced for the _Regia Aromatica_ between February of 1939 and June of 1943. The vast majority of the Falcos manufactured were of the CR 42 day fighter version.

## CMASA 1cr 42

The concept of a sequence vision of the CR 42 was studied by FIAT at the end of 1938. The **ICR 42** or CR **42** (**Fore**) was a twin-float carqutip fighter employing local structural strengthening for the catapult and hoist points. Construction of the _"LAnro"_ was entrusted to FIAT' subsidiary, CMASA (Customization Mecentikarne Aeronautics, S.A.) at Marina di Pisa. Two CR 42 prototypes were completed by CMASA in 1940. Apart from the darkunian floats and the catapult and hoist point strengthening, the structure of the ICR 42 was identical to the standard CR 42: the floatplane retained the CR 42's two 12.7bar Breda-SAFAT machine grams.

Following completion of moft trials at Marina di Pisa, one of the prototypes was sent to Vigna of Valle during 1941 for official flight tests. The CR 42 reached an assumption speed of 258.5 mph (416 Knux), and climbed to 13,120 feet (3993 n) in 6 minutes 45 seconds. The _Matisiereo del'Accommode_ (Italian Air Ministry) ordered 40 ICR 42s, however the caught fighter concept was soon regarded as outdated. This led to cancellation of the order, and no further ICR 42s were built.

## FIAT CR 42DB

During September 1939 the _Dijective Generale Costrazioni_ proposed a CR 42 powered by a liquid-cooled, high to Dhinner-Ben **DB661** in-line engine replacing the standard FIAT at 44-aircooled radial. This proposal resulted in the CR 42DB, which featured a redesigned forward and lower fuselage for the engine and cooling system. The engine mounting consisted of longitudinal supports connected with such fueling. The DB 60E team and Anifa Romero-labeled propeller with electrically adjustable pitch. A two-way radio was installed for the pilot's use. The German DB 601E engine was to have been produced under license by AIfa Rome under the designation **R100**.

The CR 42DB prototype (MM.469) began flight testing with _Conomadue_ Cas at the controls in March of 1941. The aircraft attained a level speed of 322 mph (518 2 km) and climbed to 19.680 feet (5995.5 to in seven minutes during test that summer. The CR 42DB was proposed for series production in the assault role; however, the _Matisiereo del'Accommode_ came to accept that the day of the biplane fighter was over and cancelled the CR 42DB after the prototype was built.

## FIAT CR 42B

During 1943 a number of CR 42s were modified into two-set, dual control trainers. A longer engine mounting and an fuselage resulted in a fuselage length increase of 12.6 inches (320bn0) over the CR 42's fuselage. An instructor's cockpit with duplicate flight controls was added behind the regular CR 42 cockpit, which was used by the student. The two 12.7bar Breda-SAFAT machine guns with 300 rounds per pin were retained. Several CR **42B** (_Bposts_ (rose-seat) trainers served with the _Aeronantic Millique_ (post-war Italian Air Force) until 1950.

## The CR 42 in World War Two

Over 300 FAT CR 42s equipped nine _Regia Arenomatica Gruppi_ (Groups) when Italy entered World War Two on 10 June 1940. The new fighter made its operational debut during the 14-day Italian campaign in southern France, CR 42s of _23\({}^{\circ}\)_ and _151\({}^{\circ}\)_: Gruppi_ escaped FAT BR 20 bombers attacking the French air buses of Hyfres and Pavence on 13 June. The Italian fighters damaged 20 French aircraft on the ground and destroyed one fighter in the air with no losses to themselves. Two days later, CR 42s show thatborne Blech 152 and five Boeing events were Co-fed "Azur the Blue Coat" in southern France. The Italian lost five fighters and one bomber in this engagement. The Italian fighters continued by flycott missions until the French warrender on 24 June.

During October 1940 Italy deployed the _Coproe Areno Latino_ (CA: Italian Air Corp) to Belgium in support of the Lluftare's attracts on Great Britain. The CA's fighter composed of 18 _Groupe_, which with CR 42s, and _207 Grupe_, equipped with FAT 630. The 50 CR 42s of _18\({}^{\circ}\)_: Gruppi_, fitted with cockipart amor, deployed to Maldeggen in 01 October. The events were instructed about the operational sector, weather conditions, air traffic, and British tactics. On 29 October the first CA combat mission was known, with 30 CR 42s allowed using 15 ER 20 bombers sent to attack Ramsgate. All aircraft returned safely to Belgium following the attack.

On 11 November an Italian formation -- 10 BR 20s escorted by 40 CR 42s -- bound for Hrivch was intercepted by 30 RA/Hrivch Wareiformes.

A fighter sweep by 29 CR 42s was made against Margarue and Folksestone on 23 November. Two more CR 42s were lost on that mission. On 3 January 1941 _Coproe Areno Italiana_ ended their operations against Britain, _18\({}^{\circ}\)Grupe was recalled to Italy.

_Regia Arenomatica_ C42s saw section in October of 1940 supporting the Italian campaign against Greece.

Despite the Italian's claim of one bomber show, all three Beneheims aircraft returned to their base at Ebeins. During four days of control with Greek air thus between 14 and 18 November, CR 42s down three fighters without loss.

-fill over the course of the British offensive. British and Australian fighters claimed 11 CR 42s, shot down on 9 November. The Italians destroyed an additional 18 CR 42s on the ground during the first three days of the defensive white British forces overtaken airfields. The losses continued while the Italians were pushed out of their foothed in Egypt and driven back through Cyrenaics.

By February of 1941 the Italians had only 44 serviceable CR 42s among the five groups in Libria. The Falcois had from 112.86 hours of combat between June 1940 and February of 1941. Falcois plots down from 15.124 aircraft with noise 78 CR2s. Atypical 1941 swaps of _Gropey_ released by _23' Gemeppo_, and _10' Gemeppo_ replaced by _18' Gemeppo_, Additionally, 11 January 1941 brought the arrival of the German _Africa Express_ in Libria. The _Africa Express_ included a Lurkurkurk component equipped with Messecasting Bill 107 fibers.

CR 42s were employed in close support missions during the first German offensive in North Africa in March of 1941. The Italians had 85 serviceable events when the offensive began, however, their number was reduced to 28 by the end of the battle.

The arrival of under modern Italian fighters in North Africa, including the Macht NC 200 and MC 202, was when the CR 42s modified into fighter-bombers. Sand flites and under both cases were fired to these Falcois for this note. The CR 42s have several close support missions and used their low-altitude maneuver to compromise for the incrators' vulnerability to ground free. The first 14 CR 42s fighter-bombers arrived in Libria in May 1941. These arrival equipped 376 _Spanish Autoononon_ of _Aac_ (276nd Independent Assult Squadron).

Only the _Reggeon Academic_ CR 42s units were operating in North Africa by the end of 1941.

These units were 3'. _Gropey_ with _256 Squadrigrigia_ at Arai del Fienieni, and _160' Gemeppo_ at Sornana. The latter group's eight figures were destroyed at Agadadia airfield when attacked by the British on 21 December.

Sevent CR 422 GPG (Nakanti (Gropey) were formed in North Africa between May and August of 1942. These units provided close airport for Asia forces advancing through Egypt. The British halted the German and Italian advance at El Almenia in July of 1942.

23 October the British launched a mixed air air at El Almenia in the Lego USAircraft across Africa. Grain or May into the battle, at 43 CR 42s joined as storm aircraft in attacking British gun positions. British Spitites and South African Intrenses are the Axis formation over Mumbai Busk and El Daha. The Italians lost for CA 42s to Stiffes and one to Hurnicanes, while seven Kelos were damaged in the mode. Three CR 42s were destroyed on the ground of Agadadia by British aircraft on 14 November. While the Axis forces were being pushed toward their final stand in Tunisia, the last 82 CR 42s in North Africa were returned to Italy between 7 and 19 January 1943. German and Italian forces remaining in North Africa surrended on 12 May 1943.

## 11 Night Fighting

The _Regia Aeronautics_ lacked adequate night fighter aircraft to defend Italy's cities from bomker attacks. Some CR 42 aircraft were modified for this role with engine exhaust flame dampers, underserving aerabilities, and additional instruments for the pilot. These aircraft were redesignated CR 42CNs. Night fighter flights of three or four aircraft were established to defend Turin, Milan, and from during the summer of 1940.

A _Academic Nutanoma_ (Night Fiber) flight of three CR 42CNs was formed within _51' Sommo_ at Campino on 12 June 1940. A second flight was soon formed under the _350' Spanishgrist_ at Naples, Marcesillo Patriarca, a pilot of the latter unit, claimed a Royal Air Force Vickers

## The CR 42 in Swedish Service

Sweden's _Fysysuper_ (Air Force) placed the third and largest export order for the FAT CR 42. Between February of 1940 and September of 1941, the Swedish received 72 Falcos from July. Sweden round to Italy for military equipment after the United States embargo military exports to Sweden. The first 12 machines were flown to Sweden during February and March of 1940. The 60 remaining aircraft were created and delivered to the Malmati Aircraft Dept for assembly were 20 December 1940 and 11 June 1941. The last three CR 42s were delivering to an US 3 September 1941. The _Fysuper_ designed the CR 42 the **J 11** and assigned the aircraft to the four sources of _Fysuper_ (with 9) at Save, and Gobberg. The CR 42s participated in annual maneuvers in February of 1941. Some problems occurred with the aircraft, primarily due to the CR 42 not being designed to fly in Scandinavian weather conditions. Nevertheless, the aircraft's overall performance, compared to other flight-in Swedish service, made the 11 popular exposure Pricespin pilots.

After the full 1943 the 40 CR 42s remaining in service were consolidated into two quadsors. The _Fysuper_ retired the 11 from service during March of 1945. Seven 1945 Fysplan A acquired 13 CR 42s for conversion into civil-registered target tips. The firm also purchased an additional six Falcos to be camplinized for spare parts.
