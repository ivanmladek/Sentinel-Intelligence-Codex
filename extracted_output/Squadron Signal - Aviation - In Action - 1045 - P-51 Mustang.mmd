## Introduction

Where do you start when speaking of the Mustang? I really don't know, so I thought I'd let some others say a few words first:

"One of the great "mincate" of the **war** was the fact that the long range (Mustang? fighter escort did appear over Germany at just the saving moment."_General H.H. "Hap" Arnold_

"It is my considered opinion that the P-51 played a decisive role in the airary over Western Europe."_Major General Oril Anderson_, _ Deputy CO of 8th Air Force_

"That's the plane I want!"_General Carl Spaatz_, _CO of 8th Air Force_, _seeing the Mustang production line_.

"When I saw (Mustang) figures according the bombers over Berlin, I knew the jigs us."_Hentman Goring_, _4 March 1944_

The P-51's design story begins in early 1940. The British purchasing Commission (BPC) contacted North American Aviation (NANA) about the possibility of the company license. Building Ap 70. Temmatsky for the RAF. The North American people talk at the idea and instead tried to convince the BPC that they should build an entirely new lighter of NAA's own design. Although altogether because North American had previously produced only trainer aircraft, the BPC agreed particularly to write the proposal, in January 1940. Dutch Klingeler, president of North American, and Lee Atwood, vice president, proposed the construction of 320 M&A-78, as the new aircraft was called, for the RAF. The NA-73 was to be powered by an Antonio engine, cost no more than $40,000 people will attract the armed to BPC specifications. The proposal was accepted by the BPC in April 1940 and thus was the Mustang born.

On 24 April 1940, the general arrangement drawings, hastity sketched in a New York hotel during the previous three weeks, were approved by the BPC, and a month later the

## Appendix P-51/Mustang I & IA

The first **Mustang** I was almost an exact copy of the NA-73X, A6345, the first production machine, rolled out on to 6 April 1944, seven days later. It flew for the first time. Before the fourth Mustang I had left the production line, several changes were made to the basic design. The radiator at zero soon was somewhat enlarged for better airflow into the radiator and the extrater at the extrater at zero ago those was extended forward until it was even with the thinner. A problem with alteno control was cured through the use of "boost" shots. Finally, the rounded racing-style whickness was replaced with a three-piece unit with the center piece being of helicopter of glass.

In September 1944 the second Mustang I, A6346, was rated up and shipped by boat to England. What was to be the first central to a Mustang I took place when the ship was prompted in the North Atlantic. It first normal and to collect even fight back. The Mustang arrived at RARF. But the Mustang I had 20 October and was assembled by the end of the north A6346 received a British audio and its full complement of weapons which included for 30 minutes machine guns in the wings, two.50s in the wings and an additional pair of "GS" in the nose. Flight tests revealed that the Mustang I was everything the North American engineers promised to be to be. It has no longer 382pm at 1400,100, down from the 390pm of A6345, which was attributed to the use of cammodite paint. The only shortcoming, and one which would prevent its access to a true fighter, was its lack of a service ceiling on 300,000 ft.

The British enthus enthusics about its use in ground attack and photo recon work. For the recon mission, two cameras were mounted - one immediately at the pilot on the left side and another mounted just at the end. To 2. Squadron at Sandia Polytechnium because the first operational unit in April 2012. On 10 May 1942, the first mission was then over occupied France when No. 2.Sguardo raided a German airfield was across the Manuel On 27 July 1942, No. 2.Sguardo raided a German airfield was at the start of the first 20th of the first 20th of the first 20th of the second

The A36 Apache was a US Army Air Force's derivative of the Mustang I, ordered in response to the Lurfaiteite's Ju 87 Stuka. The A36 answered the Army's need for a high-speed deep motor to support its ground. One major difference between the Stuka and the A36 was the latter's great speed. However, this high speed, part for the figure and recon role, was counter-productive to the following accuracy. To solve down the great drive speeds of the A36, copper Bomb in a vertical due to 1000.0 ft. a set of lattice-like aluminum brake panels installed in the top and bottom of the wing. With the brakes grid prior to period 100 - toffee speed was limited to 300pm. A36 introduced a new radiator of similar design but without the adjustable 124. Another change incorporated in the A36 was a return to matching our raman current - four.50s in the wing and two more in the nose. Bomb shackles were installed under the wing but not at the normal drop rate station, instead they were moved closer to the main landing gear start to 800 - minimize structural float under last and take-off conditions. A vent was added to the worst canopy panels. Additionally, the new Allison V-1710-68 was installed for even better low level performance. The 87 developed 1325hp at 3,000 ft but power dropped off rapidly above 12,000 ft. The US Army Air Corps bought 500 A36s. (The name 'Apache' was North America's invention. A365 received on official name in US service, 'Apache' is used by aviation histograms to distinguish the A36 from P.51s.) and of which were always referred to as 'Matsiang' by the USA'.

In April 1984, A36 went to war with the 27th Figure Bomber Group at Rasel Ma, French Morocco. The first mission was from 0.6 June 1984 as part of the aerial assault on the island of Panteliera. The island sputtered and 20 June 4,36 were already using its satellites for contingting against Axis forces on Stily. Both the 27th and 5th FRQ were now equipped with A36,866, three 1000 series in the 53 days after the Apache's introduction to combat. Due to its outstanding performance in the Sicily and early Italian participants, amplifiers at first stage to change the name of the A36 to 'tnacker'. The name served as reporters kept referring to the aircraft as 'Matsiang', adding to the confusion.

One other unit operated the A36 in combat -- the 31th ERQ in India. The 31th went to the central of the 1941 in defense of the Roelo Bot in the Brittler-borne route, the A36 proved second to home A-36s from 23,373 combat sorting delivering over 800 f/s of months oranges targets in the Far East and Mediterranean areas. They accounted for 84 enemy aircraft slot down, with a further 17 shot up on the ground. A total of 177 - A36s were lost out at all types of enemy action, air and ground. Not a bad record for a low-level fighter-bomber aircraft.

On 30 November 1942, Bob Chilton took the XP-51B into the air for the first time. After 45 minutes Chilton was forced to land with an overheated engine, it was discovered that a chemical reaction between the different metals is the cooling system and the glycol coolant was causing the radiator to plug up. At the same time, a new larger radiator system was planned because of the demands of the aftercohere. A bigger radiator demanded a redesign of the air scope. The first design was found to cause excess noise in flight, leading to its further redesign. The new scope was added to the second XP-51B, 43:7486. Tests revealed that the XP-51B was 50nm faster and a service cooling some 100,000 feet greater than an Alison-powered Station, 50 minutes were North American's predictions for the new radiator that the US Army Air Force Read ordered 400-51Bes through months prior to the first test flight of the XP-51B.

With Amy Air Corps to buy 400-51Bes, and RAF ordering almost 1000, North Americans's Los Angeles plant simply could not include the load. A second factory was needed. North American had a facility in Dallas, Texas, where a subsidiary company was lying out to 82-41 Dexterions. An additional order of 1350 more \(\mu\)-51Bts from Amy Air Force Readset. The Dallas could also build Masters, Dallas-will P51Bs were identified to Los Angeles-built aircraft but were designated P-51C. The first production of P-51Bs were on 3 May 1943, the first flight of a model coming in August.

The first arrival of a production Meritagating Insurance in Europe occurred in September 1943. After 60-economy and assembly, the new aircraft were turned over to a brand-new orbit under the 38th AP at Bocket on 17 November 1943. It is interesting to note that at this time the 55th AP was a 9th Air Force unit, a fighter number until the 18 Army Air Force still that take it in the east run though it has range roughly double that of other triggers in the theater and its performance for superior. An Ar Force Bomber brass were then only one test that has the P51B the aircraft that could, and would, protect the bommer alls way to end from targets in Germany. The insisted that the 55th AP is the assigned sector. On December 1943, only the 55th AP five their first mission is in the P51B. A similarly sweep over Belgium and Northern France. Their leader for the sky can Do. Dallone, like the Beagher Eagle Squadron veteran and CO of the 4th FPGA. A six aircraft returned although one had suffered minor damage from Tako. No Germanighters were encountered. The first version was found from 0 S December 1943 to Amies, France. Again, no enemy air propulsion.

On 11 December 1943, the 35th AP the Luftawfer for the first time as they excepted the "Big Friends" to Emden. The Germans still did not wait to fight and to damage was suffered by either aft6. On 10 December, the 35th AP seven on a road to 16, 480 minutes from Roberto, the startings are Allied brighter aircraft that grew from into Germany. A formalon of BT 10th-engine registers were waiting but started to run into many days after the flight except. It can generate 100 one on each second many hits before breaking off its attack. The Group fee to Bremen on 16 December and L1 Charles Gumm shot a 60 minutes from 40 to 110 ft of the first confirmed P-51B 401 off the war. The 35th AP five would go on to show about 700 more enemy aircraft -- the most auto-air arrives of any Allied outfit in World War III

Modifications to the basic P-51B-comment throughout the production run. A new engine, the P-51B-comment was introduced in the P-51B-comment. A new engine to 1500 at Bocket. At B-55 point the cell was added behind the pilot without further increased the P-51B-comment. The new task installation led to some control problems which were later turned out through the use of aft-metal elevators.

Brits with the P-51B-comment, called that Shallen's Mephine, began New No. 19 Squadron received brand-new aircraft in February 1944. Modifications to British aircraft included the sliding, Maltonhoodhood, a pioneering 'bubble' category, vision was much better and headroom was increased. Even though strictly a British development, several US Groups soon acquired a number of the new bubble changes.

By was and P-51B-comment were all in terms. A total of 3738 aircraft were produced, 944 of them being Mustang Mills. Several were later modified to two-agent instruments by removing the baseline fuel that adding a second coach in its place. The Mephine powered Mustang would break the back off the _Lurvature_ On 4 March 1944, Hermann Gorming would look up into the spikes over Berlin and see P-51B8 from the 4th E6 flying escort to the B-ITS. We knew then that it was a matter of time...

## P-51 D & K/Mustang IV

The P-SID is generally accepted as the definitive Mustang, even though some later models were lighter and faster. It was most definitely the finest fighter design to come out of Word War II. Every modification that had been performed to the Bonded in its production run was incorporated into the design, it would use the Pacard-Martin V-1650-S/P-engine, the same as late model 9:518B and C-S. Lower subarcher gear rates resulted in much better shuttor abundance. Maximum power \(T_{max}\) = 785 TB/00 in War Emergency Low Slewer setting at 3.000m. There were too many items that sent the 0.002 apart from all earlier Mustang. The first was an armament change from four 50 calive machine guns to six, all mounted in the wings. Since the four 50 calive guns in eight P-SID had had already 150 mfa to meet their being mounted on their side, the six 50s in the Droid model were mounted upright. This eliminated most of the jamming problems. The ammod of the D was measured, not only totally to cover the extra pair of runs also by extra rounds per qua. There would be 400 rounds for each of the head guard guns and 270 rounds for each of the other four guns. The underlying physics were strengthened so as to carry either the new 110 or 165 gallo drop rats or a 1000 to both. Later D models would be able to carry their nonchik on short launch stubs on the underside of the wing.

The third major change was, of course, the bubble canopy. The P-SID bubble canopy was a direct result of the research that developed the plastic bombardment's nose on aircraft such as the B-T1 Flyng Forens. A new unwiscator was also designed to complement the energy forward. Use of the bubble canopy meant that the "raroackack" at fusage had to be cut down level with the top of the nose. Later D models would have a "fit" failed to extend the vertical in- This dorsal run also added to correct some directional stability problems inherent in the Merlin Mustang. Some units also modified 9:518C movies with the added dorsal fin.

The P-SID was a Dallas-Built Droid with a redesigned canopy for more headroom. The "K" also used an Aeronautical propri propriet in place of the Hamilton-Stardardard Arp found on all other MartianMutangians, it was not a design development for better performance that led to use of the Autopestropis propriet, rather it was the fact that Hamilton-Stardardard could not keep up with demand for their proof which was used on most of the military aircraft of the P-SID. Aeronauticals are different in many ways. It is noted as ideal blade in place of the H-Sold aluminum type and it used a totally different pitch change mechanism which allowed faster warmup and 6\({}^{\circ}\) per second blade angle changes. However, the Aeronauticals were also included and up to 195. were rejected for excessive vibration. Most of the P-SID rocket run swept to Great Britain or Australia.

All photo recon versions of the Mustang were called 6-B - C-R00 was based on the 6-DD surface and different from earlier recent Mustangians in that all the cameras were built in the lower at fusage instead of being the coolest. Three cameras were mounted: A-T - R/20 for aar ranging to 30,000 UT. attitude and a K-24 low (4000-0.000 UT) camera. Additionally, the full configuration of 5.00 calive machine guns were carried. With AmericanLog Angeles modified 136 P-5IDs to F-D0 specs while the Dallas plant built 183 P-S-R08.

More P-SID would be built that an other various variants combined, a total of 960s. They would equip 6450s in the B-M Force alone. With the exception of a few 24-m units, and even fewer P-40 units, Menstang would equip almost the entire USAAR fighter force in 1945. The P-SID had and defeated the best that the Germans and Japanese couloped against it. The world was one again for free people to inhabit - or was 17 Five years later, on a cold desequise emphasis in Asia, as an aggressor would again try to impose its full own an unwilling people. The P-SID would fight again and do very well in this, the first year. Still, in 1965. They would join other degrees of the Middle East. Issard seek the best of these World War II at forces to protect themselves: Splitting, Masserschmittts and P-SIDs. There was no question that the insists considered the Mustang far and away the best of the three. It would be the last major ar action for the Mustang.

## Appendix B.51h

The P-SH was the end result of a program at North American to cut weight off the Mistrano as on mask 12 more competitive with the Spphire and Messersersmith in rate of climb. A lightweight lighter study, combined with combat agents indicating problems that e-1 pilots were cooperating and test results from three experimental Mistrangs - D-SH-T. As e-SH-T and P-SH-T are routinely enforced in the protection lightweight P-SH. The test weight of the P-SH was to be kept below or 800 ksec, from the P-SH. It was accomplished through the use of a much more cross-section with a redesigned bubblepy enough, a much smaller landing gear start and wheels and an Aeronautics or to filter weight and angle free blades. The engine was the proven Packard V-1650 s issued in the P-SH. The X-91s were all tested at 450 ksecs and test flights resulted in a loop of 4600 s after a cut of climb of 4.000 per minute.

The XP-51s was an XP-51s after further test with an experimental Rolly R-24s4 engine that featured every two tested control devices device in place of a carbitron. When the device was "right" it would develop over 2,000,000 at 2000,000. To speed the for 250 ksec to 450nm at a climb rate of over 500,000 rpm was maintained. Due to the fact that the cockula was not pressurized, the service ceiling was limited to 4600,000. The XP-51s was a stretched buffer at different shutout and the new Aiso 7170-119, which was supposed to be equal to the special Merit Roth-41s. Tests were placed by many problems with the new engine. Eventually the problems were removed out and the engine out to power at full P-24s through the E-1s.

The P-SH was basically an XP-51s at thirteen methanol stretch to the fuselage using the Packard V-1650 s which delivered 13800 s at 3,0000 and 22700 in Winer Europe Low Sight with water injection. The function then stretch was used to correct simultaneously by problems that had been encountered in the other lifestyles. A taller vertical unit was fitted to all production. P-51s after the short aircraft. The H also tested a four-blended cuffless Aeronautics proof, a smaller tilt soon soon and a larger, deeper radiator housing. Contrary to popular belief the P-SH never saw combat in any way. It was the only Mistrano ever to do so and also the only three not so that to vary rotation. Although 370 different heat belonged to the Amy ArA Foreo to the V-13.0.0.0.0 found that any constant units in time for the final fight, by the time Korean War broke out in June 1950, the P-SHs were all pushed out of active W1s at Forteg service. However, the H model did perform woman duties for the US Air Force in the tough years between the two wars when that service was in transition to an entirely jet inventory.
