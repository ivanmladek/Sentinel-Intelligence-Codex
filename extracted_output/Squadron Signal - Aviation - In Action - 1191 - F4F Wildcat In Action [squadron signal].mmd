XF4F-3

Following the mixing on 11 April 1938, the remains of the XF4F-2 (BaN0 0383) were returned to the Germanium factory. Some parts were used to build a new topology, this time designated **XF4F-3**. A content authoring the production of this aircraft was signed in October of 1938. Interestingly, the aircraft carried the same Bureau Number as its predecessor, 0383. The XF4F-3's first flight occurred on 12 February 1939.

XF4F-3 (Early)

The XF4F-3 different from the XF4F-2 in many ways. The XF4F-3 was powered by a 1200 m Part & Whitney R-1830-76 fatal engine equipped with a two-stage, two-speed super-charge. This engine offered 150 mue horsepower than the XF4F-3 F-1830-66. The aircraft was also 19 inches (83.3 cm) longer that the previous model. Additionally, wing dihedral was increased and wingspan went from 34 feet (10.4 to 38 feet (11.6 u). All flying surfaces now sporned squared tips, which soon became a standard feature of Guomman aircraft.

XF4F-3 (Late)

Aerodynamic refinements and engine cooling issues required numerous changes to the basic XF4F-3 airframe. Persistent cooling problems with the engine are several coupling, own flap, and propeller spinter variations. Tail surfaces also went under an evolutionary redesign. Following an aerodynamic analysis in the National Advisory Council of Aeronautics (NACA)

XF4F-3 (Final)F4F-3 Wildcat

In August of 1939, the United States Navy (USN) placed an order for 54 F4F-3 aircraft. Grumman anticipated the Navy order and began constructing the first two aircraft even before the production contract was signed. The first production F4F-3 (BuNo 1844) flew in February of 1940.

The FF-3 had a nitrogen of 38 feet (11.6 x0, a length of 28 feet 9 inches (8.8 x0), and a height of 11 feet 4 inches (3.5 x0, 16.5 meg weight was 5260 pounds (2375 x0), while its maximum weight was 7065 pounds (2025 x0).

One 2000 fruit & Whitney & 1830-76 x0 - 145/mider, air-cooled, radiation plane turned a three-ball metal powder. The seeing gave the Wildcat a maximum speed of 331 swu (533) swu (22.000 feet (6760 s) and average ceiling 37.00 feet (11.278 s). Its range on 147 gallos (556.6) of internal test was 800 miles (1384 x0).

Following the first flight, Grumman realized 1844 for manufacture's evaluations before it was sent to F4F & Whitney's Hartedt, Connecticut facility for engine testing. The second F4F-3 (BuNo 1845) conducted its initial flight in July of 1940 and was delivered to NAS Ancucutia the following month for Production Inspection Trials. BuNo 1845 was later sent to

A 1200 in Part & Whitney R-1830-76 14-cylinder, air-cooled, radial engine supplied power with a two-stage, two-speed superbermacher. These aircraft operated the 'checks' interorder intakes. Most of the eight Wiltcourse were fitted with a M.M II telescope spin and boxlight protruding through the windshield. These early Wiltouts could also carry two 100 pound (45 x\(\alpha\)).

Gunnmann manufactured 27 F&F-3s in this configuration (BuNos 2512-2533) and delivered them to the Navy in February of 1941, BuNos 2512 through 2500 were assigned to F-71, while 2520 through 2512-2538 went to F-42.

Communation delivered 19 more F&F-3s (BuNos 3856-3874) to the USIN Jun 1941. These Wiltouts had an internally mounted connector, replacing the externally mounted copper on earlier F4-3s. In June of 1941, with F4F-3s (3856-3875) were delivered to V4-2, while another two (3806-3861) were UV-7.1. An unspecified number made their way to F-72. Later still, VF-98 used were aircraft from this batch as trainers prior to Operation TORCH, the Anglo-American invasion of French North Africa in November of 1942.

The Very Wilders suffered several early developmental problems. The first of these was an uncontaminated deployment of the wing-mounted flotation bags, which were intended for use in the event of a dichroic. These bags were fabricated that belong to be recovered. Several incidents occurred where the bags deployed in flight. Another problem was the weakest of the windshield participants. During ship-speed, these three emerged panels had a temporary to fail. Aluminum bracing strips were made to certify this problem. This modification was also made to **F4/3-As** and the **Mattes M.B. III**, and **IV**.

Lessons from combat we have utilized modified with armer puling for the cockpit and some portions of the engine. Self-seined filter blades and amorred windshields pass were also installed. Shoulder strips were added to the pilot's seat in early 1942. All these modifications added weight to the airframe, which degraded performance with every pound model.

In early 1941, there was a break in 1941: reproduction to facilitate manufacture of F&F-3ss (BuNos 3875-3904 for Greece, 3905-3969 for the US), F4F-3 production then resumed, with Grommma building 88 aircraft (BuNos 3970-4057) between July and September of 1941.

14Xf4f-6

While war production geared up throughout the world, aircraft engine demand increased accordingly. This fact, along with the developmental delays being encountered with the two-stage supercharger in the Part A Whitney R-1830 series engines, prompted the Navy to order two Xf4f-6, Buxes JR86 and 18647. These aircraft were used to evaluate the 12000 Wight R-1820-40 time/slider, wide wall engine. The Xf4f-6 (Buxes JR86) was 7031, which differed by having a Part A Whitney R-1830-40-14 cylinder, two-row radial engine with a single-type, two-speed supercharger. Production Xf4-38 were equipped with either the R-1830-60 or 86 engine equipped with two-stage, two-speed supercharger, which gave enhanced performance at a altitude.

A single Xf4f-6 (6 hr377/Buxe 7031) was completed and flow for the first time on 11 October 1940 and delivered to NAS Anacous 20 November 1940. It was found to have similar performance to the standard Xf4-3, with performance differences most noticeable at altitudes. In service ceiling was 34,000 feet (10.363), so compared to the Xf4-33 (11.278 s). Following this evaluation, the Xf4f-6 was used as a set aircraft for a variety of cockpit control evaluations. It was destroyed in each on 25 May 1942, which killed the pilot.

Because of the difficulties encountered with the two-stage stage in 1830s, the Navy decided to purchase a limited number of R-1830-90-powered Wildson designated F4-3A-Dix. Delivery of the first F4F-3A to Marine Fighting Squadron One Eleven (VMF-111) at Quaneco, Virginia took place in April of 1941.

F4F-7 Wildcat

Recognizing the need for a long-range reconnaissance aircraft well before the attack on Pearl Harbor, the US Navy's Bureau of Aeronautics (BioAr) approached Gummont to determine the feasibility of converting two standard F4F-3 airframes to meet the host. By the end of January of 1941, Gummontan and the Navy agreed and development of this specialized aircraft began. Even before conversion would startout to the two airframes, the Navy increased its requirement and asked Gummontan to build 24 aircraft, designated F4F-7, based on the upcoming F4F-4 air-frame.

These 21 F4F-7s (BioNs 5263-5283) were unique in Wildcat production. They featured non-folding wing capable of carrying 555 gallos (2101 \(\circ\)) of fuel. This coupled with the 117-gall-10 (143) I designe taxel lookup the pilot made for a total of ten dayside of 672 gallos (2544.1). A F4F-56 camera was mounted in the fencing, eliminating the auxiliary faceplate that. This camera was mounted slightly if of center, immediately at the fencing value.

That leak-F4F-7s key recognition feature was a fuel dimming system, which enabled the pilot to get the aircraft down to a reasonable landing weight should an emergency landing be required. This dump consisted of two openings ranging from the fuel walls at to two fuel vents located at the base of the reader. Because of the wet location, the tail navigation light was repositioned to the motor, just under the trim tub. All ammunated and retained equipment was removed from the F4F-7.

Because of the extended flight durations that would be encountered, the F4F-7s also featured out to alls located forward of the pilot. An external 52ug was fitted in the primary tank and can be seen in photos. Finally, a curved Pleiglas windshield, an L-shaped pitch tube, and an impulsive reset installed.

The F4F-7s first flight took place on 30 December 1941. The aircraft's gross weight was an amamam 10.328 pound (4685 \(\circ\)). Its range was said to be 3700 miles (5954 \(\circ\)), with a flight endurance of 24 hours.

The F4F-7 served primarily with Marine Observation Squadron Two Fifty Emye (VMO-251). At various times, six F4F-7s (Musks 5263, 5265, 5265, 5270, 5271, and 5272) were assigned to the Squadron while at Espintu Santo. One was typically assigned to each carrier during the Oakland campaign in 1992-43. The Navy ordered over 100 F4F-7s; however, only 21 aircraft were produced.

**An Fat-7 (Buflo S276) is parked at the Gummont factory. The distinctive fuel during pipes are mounted immediately below the radede.

## Xr4f-5

Persistent problems with the R-1830's two-stage supercharger prompted the US Navy to seriously consider alternate powerful arrangements for the Wildca. This prompted the Navy to amend its original production contract. The third and fourth production P4F-33 (Busus 1846 and 1847) were modified to accept the 1200 w Wright R-1820-40 Cyclone time-cylinder, air-coded, radial engine with single-stage supercharger.

The Xr4f-53 initial flight occurred in June of 1940, with delivery to NAS Ancuocita taking place the following month. During cavitation, it reached a top speed of 306-409 (492) RAM at 15,000 feet (4572) 0. Performance decelerated at higher altitudes, due to the single-stage supercharger.

The two Xr4f-53 appeared externally similar to the G-36A/Martlet MBI when delivered. A shorter chord coupling, characteristic of Wright-powered Wilcka, was used. It featured no cow lips and an external extruder cowge at the top. The Xr4f-55 were also filled with Hamilton Standard Hydraulic constant speed three-based metal suppliers.

Both aircraft were modified again near the end of 1942, this time to be different supercharger's high-powering instabilities. Busu 1846 received a Wright R-1820-54 stub-supercharger option. Other changes made to this aircraft reduced a series of cow lips on the top of the cowling, roughly between the 10 \(\sigma\)/clock and 2 \(\sigma\)/clock positions. Additionally, a large single exhaust stock produced downward just forward of the landing gear. Performance evaluations revealed a speed of 340-409 (574) RAM at 25,060 (6077) 0.

The second Xr4f-53 (Busu 1847) received an R-1820-40 setting equipped with a two-stage supercharger. Distinguishing characteristics included a short-chord coupling with no cowl dips, just-step exhausts and oil collects being relocated from the normal underwriting position to the engine accessory section. This installation bore similarly to the Xr4f-8. To speed on this aircraft was 1366 (509 RAM) at 19,500 feet (5944) 0. No production models of the Xr4f-5 new built.

* [2]**Bulko 1997**, originally constructed for as an F4F-3, was modified to become the X/F4-4. The major change that came with the X/F4-4 was the installation of folding wings. This feature reduced the aircraft's footprint considerably, the 36-footfoot (11.6 s) wings folding at up to give the Wilcott a folded span of 14 feet 4 inches (4.4 0). (Bulko)

Space is always at a premium aboard ships at sea, particularly aircraft carrier flight and BAPOR. It was so wonder that the Navalford is still neutral F4F-3 production current in early 1940. They directed Roman out to deliver the final F4F-3 of the initial production back (Bulko 1987) with a set of vibrationally folding wings. None that Lenroy Grumman himself devised devised the folding method, called "to-wing", The wing folded at and rounded very 90" to a folded position parallel with the fuselose. This feature reduced the Wilcott's wingman from 38 feet (11.6 s) only 14 feet 4 inches (4.4 0).
* [4]**I. It is worthwhile to this point to explain the changes in the aircraft's structure to accommodate the folding wing assembly. The Wilcott's wings were locked to the fuselose at three points, two on the main part of the site at forward geometry 51 13/22 inches (13.5 0.0). This was constant throughout the Wilcott series, roof-follow and folding wings alike. On the Far4F-37, the main wing extended outwards from the main part areachment fittings. This was not the case on the folding wing, viscous wings were made in two sections: the sub wing and the outer panel. The other panel provides the folding wings at a first epovere-surface is likely its lines (15.2 0.0) farther than in the Far4F-37's main part. Since Grumman wished to place the fold structure of the strongest point on the wing, this meant that the main part would be further at on the outer panel. To accommodate these factors, Grumman's'specify the main spr at approximately 18" in the sub wing. From here, the main spr then extended laterally to the wingtip.
* [5]**A. Another change that came with the folding wing was amament location. To make room for the folding mechanism, it was necessary to move the gums further, onboard the wing. On earlier aircraft, the gums were placed 65 inches (165 0.0) and 75 inches (191 0.0) from the aircraft center. The F4F-4's is shown again was 12 inches (30.5 0.0) further out in the wing. These weapons were held at 77 inches (195.6 0.0), 86 inches (218.4 0.0), and 123 inches (312.4 0.0) from the aircraft centerline.**

Following successful testing of the X3F8-4 in 1941, the US Navy ordered 436 F4F-4s in June of the same year. Production commenced line in 1941 and five had been delivered to the Navy by the end of that year. The first software is quadtrees commenced in early 1942, with the initial aircraft going to the East Coast. In late March, VFM-6 aboard the carrier USENTER-PRISE (C-V) follow delivery of eight F4F-4s. By the nine ENTERPRISE and HORENT (C-V), 8F1 Hawaii for the Tokyo F4F and 83 April, VFM-6 had 22 F4F-4s and five F4F-3s, while HORENT's V-5s had 30 F4F-4s. These were the first operational F4F-4s.

The F4F-4's introduction to the late west are 1993 similar to the previous five then. The addition of a stupted destination, we additional 5.0 delay (12.700) machine guns, and full armor made the F4F-4s' 700 pounds (318) coverage that is 1055. Performance suffered accordingly. Comm Comm Commersade had the F4F-4 became more called to earlier aboard ship due to the folding wing. This variant featured an armor of 83 500 filter (12.700) flowing 270 matching pins in the folding wing. Additionally, the long straightup tube was moved from just outlined 4 of Wing Station 154 on the F4F-3 to a smaller "L" shaped up just instead of Wing Station 222 on the F4F-4s. Thus change was made to resolve clearance issues with the point that the ground drawing the stupted destination. Finally, the owing was fit-used with four color ports per side and an external controller groove.

This variant's central control introduction did not occur until the Batlio of Johnson on 4-7 June 1942, when all three US carriers - ENTERPRISE, Hornster, and YORNON (C-V) - each channel 27 F4F-4s has long battle. During a period from 28 May to 13 June, the combined force lost 23 F4F-4s during the battle and one other aircraft in an operational ring.

Following the Band of Midway, Navy and Marine Corps fighter spudrons continue to be equip with the F4F-4s. By the time the Qualicanican campaign began on 7 August 1942, F4F-4s were operating with all three carrier-based spudrons in the campaign: VF-5 on SARTOA, VF-5 on ENTERPRISE, and VF-7 on WASP.

There can be little doubt of the significance of the contribution that Marine Corps and NavyWalocats made in the defense of Gudalcalani in the Solomon Islands. Once the airstrip at Lange Point (Henderson Field) was secured and made operational, Marine squadron operated precisely to prevent the Japanese from reching the contested island. The first two MAJ John Smith's WAF223, which was established from the resort carrier USS Longio USAND (CVE-1). The end of August saw the arrival of MAJ Robert Galve's WAF224 and SARATOGA V5-F5 (program) at the newly commissioned "Fighter One" airstrip, over the next six months in addition to the weapons listed above, Marine weapons VMS-112, 121, 122, 212, and 703-251 also fought from the fields of Gudalcalani, along with the Navy's V5-F5-10. Other Navy F4F-48 from V5-F7-11, and V7-22 sawtooth from either carriers or Egyptian Santi in New Heidelberg, Southeast of Gudalani.

It was during this period of the Pacific War War the Wildset's lack of large became apparent. The 147-gallom (55 \(\pm\)) best capacity served limited the F4F's range. In the spring of 1941, the Chief of Naval Operations suggested that carrier flights be given more more free operations over open ocean. Bu\(\alpha\)wer then asked Grumman to study ways to increase the F4F-3's range. Grumman's answer came in the shape of two 4-gallom (159 \(\pm\)) non-jetson-sheet for talks, one under such air.

In early 1942, a number of tunnels was made available at Pearl Harbor where an F4F-4 (Bus Co) was modified to accept one of these tunnels under the foreshse. This modification allowed the tank to be dappublic. One found waddable, the modification was made to sever several effect-4. It appears the most common of this configuration was during few flights between Gudalcalani and Egyptian Santi during the Solomon Islands Campaign. While some aircraft were modified to accept the tanks, no evidence suggests that this configuration was carried under strong competition.

Later in the production, our Germanium introduced hardpins and planning in the nine winds that could accept a bomb rock capable of carrying either a good or a 5-gallom (220 \(\pm\)) terxtrop-shaped drop tank. This modification was also incorporated into the later FM-1 and FM-2 variants.

In the Atlantic theater of operations, the carrier USS WASP (CV-7) was used twice to ferry with this installation, (BusC)

## Wildcat Testbeds

While the Wildcat bore the brunt of early war naval air combat in both the British Fleet Air Arm (FAA) and US Navy, its role as a test aircraft cannot be ignored. Perhaps one of the most unusual tests done with a Wildcat occurred in 1942 when experiments were conducted in which F4F were turned by other aircraft. In various experiments, A20, T2F, and B-17s were used as two planes. The system was designed in such a way that allowed the Wildcat to restart the engines in flight, detach, and recover normally at an airfield or reattach to the worsening aircraft. In 1975-1970 tow tow Wildcat.

Wildcat were also tested with Jet-Assisted Air Quality Metrics. All four detectors were carried hand-based experiments were conducted using an AF4-1, while later experiments were conducted at sea using an AF4-1. The other information on these experiments was found.

On the F4F4 (blue S2G) was fitted with "bigg" flags. On this aircraft, a non-folding wing was installed and a stand fired fired the normal split flag. Additionally, a second flap was installed just forward of the aircraft. This flow has flush with the underscale of the wing when not deployed. The hindout legs were operated by the aircraft's geometric seam, as with production Wildcat, while the outer flaps were electrically actuated. This aircraft received the Command design design design G-53.18 instead. In these first flight on SMP, 1942, however, the project was terminated when 52G called following an asymmetric deployment of the outboard flips. German test pilot Jimmy Taylor was killed in the crash.

One AF4-1 was modelled with extended wingings and was known as "Long Wing". Photo interpretation estimates approximately three feet (0.39) were added to the spun of each wing. No further information has been uncovered on this aircraft.

Yet another F4F was modified with "breakaway" winglips. Engineers concluded that airframeweight could be saved if a portion of the wingtip was designed to break off at a prescribed high "G" (gravity) load. By breaking off, the immense airframe stress on the wings would be reduced, possibly preventing structural failure of the entire wing. The modified F4-4, with a nominal wingtipson reduced by two feet (0.6 s) to 36 feet (11 s), and breakable pits that measured 3.5 feet (1.1 s) each. Following a proper wingtip breakway, the span was reduced to 29 feet (38 s). A portion of the allowes was included as part of the breakway structure. Flight tests were conducted in 1944 with this F4-4 and were deemed successful. While earlier achieving production on the Wilfox, the feature was incorporated into Grammar's FSF Board.

## Wildcat Explorus

In rapid succession between November and December of 1939, representatives from Finland, Belgium, and Iran requested quotes on possible purchases of Wildcat.

### Finland

From a letter dated 22 November 1939 to the Finnish Military Air Atrache, Minimum provided two copies of specifications for the Minimum G-36 and a price equation to a COIL Ziliases of the Finnish Air Force. These aircraft were to be equipped with R-1830-S2C4-6 engines capable of operation on 87 octane fuel. No further correspondence has been located.

### Belgium

Belgin Air Mission officer MA JML.J. Theis requested a price equation for production lots of 40, 60, and 80 G-36 aircraft in late November of 1939. These aircraft were to have been powered by a Part B Whitney R-1830-SJC3 engine. Prices and delivery schedules were planned, but nothing ever came of the order.

### Iran

Iran interest in the Wildcat not only included the purchase of 50 aircraft, but also included a request for quotes for the design rights of the aircraft. It also appears there was interest in manufacturing them in Iran for equiped to other countries of the region. Iranian G-36s were to have been powered by Iran R. Whitney R-1830-SJC3. In any event, the Imperial Iranian Air Force never purchased Wildcat.

the F4-4 was used in experiments to test breakway meetings. Designed to fall at a prescribed "G" (gravity) loading. It was determined that the reduced load would represent catastrophic time flashes. This feature was located on the Granuna F6E Beeret, which entered serious as World Star. Two ended in 1948. This F4-4 nominal 38 feet (11 s) wingtipson was reduced to 28 feet (8.4 s) when the tge broke amp. (MINA)

## Xr4f-8

During [143], both the F4U Coreair and the F6F Relict with their superior performance began fading their way into US Navy and Marine Corps squadron. Despite this development, there was a need for an aircraft to equip quadroscats attached to the recent carfats that began to reach the free in large numbers in 1943. To this end, the Navy's Bureau of Aeronautics (Blueer) requested that Grumman build a lightweight variant of the F4F. Grumman's answer to this request was the Xr4f-8.

The Xr4f-8 was Grumman's effort to decrease the Wildera's weight and also improve performance. The powerful case for this aircraft was the 1350 W Wright XR-1820-56 Cyclone with a single-stage, two-speed supercomputer. It had an increase of 150 or over the F4F-8 W Ath Athray & R1803-66. Another advantage of this viewpoint was the resultant weight strips, since the R1820-56 had fool cylinder heads in place of the heavier cast units.

Grumman built two Xr4f-8s, the first prototype (BuNO 12228) equipped with an unified Hannular Standard Hydromite propeller and stored flaps. Its argument was six.50 caliller (127.200 Wyoming Wyoming 22m cameras -- there in eachwig. This aircraft finally fleve on 8 November 1942. The slotted flaps did not offer any improvement over split flaps and were replaced with standard split flaps. Additionally, the vertical fin and rudder axes were increased to counteract the meet powerful ceiling's storage.

The second prototype (BuNO 12229) fleve shortly after the first machine. This aircraft incoporated the third fan and rudder axis flaps, but this was changed back to the split flap configuration of it rendered the two hybrids without returns. Both Xr4f-8s were delivered to the Navy following manufacturer testing at the end of 1942.

Grumman's emphasis on ticket production requested in the Eastern Al Division of General Motors Using the production version of this aircraft, designated the FM-2. Eastern had previously built 839 FM-1s. The Navy signed a contract to purchase 1256 FM-2s early in 1943, with the first aircraft delivered in the fall of the same year.

Removed access panels reveal the powerful installation of the second Xr4f-8 (Buulo 12229). The scheduled oil code is located at the bottom of the accessory section at the end of the engine. The exhaust system is also visible. The additional 150 was provided by the Wright 8-1820-56 necessitated an increase in vertical fin and rudder axes. (Northrop Grumman)

# Eastern Aircraft Division FM-1 Wildcat

Grumman decided in early 1942 to eventually cease Wildcat production in favor of the Wildcat's successor, the F6P-3 Bellcat, then under development. In order to keep a constant flow of combat aircraft coming off the line and going to forward areas while Helical production ramped up, Grumman decided that another manufacturer would assume all Wildcat and TBF average rouped bomber reduction.

Again this backday, it must be remembered that the automobile manufacturing giant General Motecus (GM) ceased all commercial automobile production when the war began, leaving zone manufacturing plants like, General Motecus established the Eastern Aircraft Division, made of five East Coast GM production facilities. Following negotiations between the Navy, Grumman, and GM in early 1942, the Teena, New Jersey plant was chosen as the site to build Eastern's version of the TBF, known as the TPM. The Linden, New Jersey plant was chosen as the manufacturing stage for the F6P-3 Bellcat, to be known as the F4P-3 Bellcat. The remaining three production plants supplied for production to the Linden and Trenton facilities.

On 18 April 1942, the Eastern Aircraft Division was assumed a production contract for 1800 FA1-1 aircraft under these frozen Grumman. Under this contract, Grumman provided ten ships of Wildcat sub-s-sembles is an remnant. The first General Motecus-assembled Wildcat was shown in 31 August 1942. The first aircraft, based on subsausembles from Grimman, incorporated as a cell of (12,720)routing MB mac phase in the wing, This was reduced for some plants at subsequent FM-1 following complaints from pilots regarding the F6P-3 Bellcat's disgillness and the reduced firing rate of a st-spi-smanner. Eastern Aircraft delivered 21 FM-1s to the Navy by the beginning of 1943.

F6P-1 production accelerated rapidly and Eastern Aircraft completed 839 FM-1s for the US Navy by September of 1943, when production ceased in favor of the newer F6P-2. An additional 131 FM-1s were accepted by the Royal Navy's F6P-1 Air Arm (MA) under Lense-Lense. The British designation for the TPM was 148 martart by Novos, in January of 1944, the FAA adopted the name bucket for all further deliveries.

F8P-1s, like the earlier F4P-4s, were ideally suited for service about the US Navy's huge fleet of small crew (CVE). With a folded wingman of just over 14 feet (43 s), the Wilcat lock up constantly leads space that either F6P-1s or Vought Full Corains. Its primary deployment is part of a Composite Subatum (V6), which typically consisted of TBP/TRIS and F8P-1s. Numerous V6s were embarked for operations in the Pacific, where they provided close support for applications operation. Several V6s were assigned to Atlantic Fleet sector carriers, providing course defense and anti-substanative duties.

The F8P-1s was powered by a 1200 Port A Whitney Road (FR-1806-46-cylinder), air-cooled, radial engine fitted with a two-stage, two-speed supercharger. It had performance similar to that of the F8P-4 on which was based. The total number of rounds of ammonium increased, as fleet active requests, for extended fitting time. The four pan FM-1 had a total capacity of 1720 rounds (430 rounds per gun), compared to 1440 rounds (240 rounds per gun) carried by a six-gun Wilcat. The FM-1 - like the entire F6P-4 - was planned for two 58 US Gallon FM-1 Wing Arzenment

## Martlet Mk II/G-36B

In mid-1940, the British purchasing Commission ordered 100 Grumman **G-36B**s under the designation **Martlet Mk II**. While generally satisfied with the performance of its Martlet Mk I, they were not considered suitable for shipboard use since they were built to French specifications.

The Martlet Mk II was equipped with a 1200 m Parat & Whitney R-1830-35C4-G, the civil-in designation for the R-1830-90 single-stage, two-speed superbermolger engine. Its preference was similar to the F4-F3A, which was utilized in the R-1830-90.

First flight of the initial Martlet Mk II (AMS65) occurred in October of 1940. Grumman retained this aircraft for test purposes. The first nine aircraft (AM95-AM95) were delivered to the FA in March of 1941. They were manufactured in non-folding wings with two 50 califer (12-700) machine guns per wurg. Upon bearing of Grumman's efforts to develop the "sto-wing", the British amendment filter consist with Grumman to deliver the remaining aircraft of the contract with six-gun folding wings and retrofect the first nine aircraft.

An interesting note in the development of the Martlet Mk II was the aircraft's guide tube. Initially built with an eight the identical to that of the F4-F3, this tube was easily damaged during folding. An alternate pointing was chosen, this being a "7" shaped pitte aboard the port silicon. Most of the aircraft were later delivered with the "1" shaped been seen on F4-F4 and subsequent variants. One Martlet (AM964) was built with two pitte tubes.

**Wildcat Mk IV (F4F-4B)**

Under the 1941 LenJ-Lease Act, the US Government provided aircraft to both the Royal Air Force (RAF) and Royal Navy Fleet Air Am (FAA). Among the first aircraft to be exported under LenJ-Lease were 202 With Grulgo-powered Marckets, known as **Marticle Mk IVs**. The Marticle Mk IV (known as the F4F-4B) realized the three-gin folding wings of the F4F-4B, but was prepared by a 1200 mW to Right-1820-on-OJ cyclone with a single-stage, two-speed supercomputer. The engine was installed in a short-order cooling, which featured two small cost flyps, one on each side of the aircraft. The Doppler installed was a one-to-third Hamilton Soundar Hydcommatic, similar to the installation on the Marticle Mk IV. The Marticle IV had an overall length of 28 feet 5 inches (8.7 x) and a wingar of 38 feet (11.6 x). Three 50 califer (12.200 Browning M2 machines) were installed in the folding outer panel of each wing, in an arrangement list on the F4F-4.

The 220 Market Mk IVs were assigned against members 1800 through FN310. Delivery of the first aircraft took place 27 February 1942, and 12 new approved by the end of the November. Three Marticle Mk IVs (V2ND25-FN207) were lost at any time shipment. The British shipped 17 Marticle Mk IVs to Vossheng, Kenya, while all other ones were used in England for further disposition.

The first unit to receive Marticle Mk IVs was No 892 Square, which took six on strength at NAS Portfolio, in July 1942. After transpect boxed to England, 892 undertook convisioned outages from the second mirror RIS ARCHER beginning in 1943. After Mk IVs served in 26 different Areas in all major entage during World War Two.

The first computer show Mrk IVs yielded a major reiter using Operation TODER, the invasion of French Africa in November 1942. During TOCRI, No 892 (HRS VTCORIOUS) and No 893 Spaunders (HMS FORMDABLE) flewrites IVs, with 882 claiming several skills against Visibly French and German aircraft. Due No 882 Square Outage can even managed to "capture an artifact near Angliga, Algeria. Both 882 and 893 Spaunders claimed the unusual distinction of having their Mk IVs regulated with US national inspirings, with the belief being that Visibly forces were more likely to surrender to the Americans than to the British.

**Marticle Mk III**

**Prelimating TODER, Marticle Mk IVs participated in other notable operations; including Sicily, Sartone and the invasion of Southern France in August 1944. Besides these operations, Marticle Mk IVs also participated in Atlantic and Mediterranean ecology sectors and anti-subarcum ports.**

## Wildcat Mk V

Following the transfer of Wildcat production from Grunman facililoles to General Motos' Eastern Airent Division, the US Navy ordered 1800 FM-1s for service on escort and light carriers in both the Atlantic and Pacific fluences of war. Only 839 of these were delivered to the US Navy before reproduction shifted to the FM-2 and an additional 311 FM-1s were delivered to the Royal Royal River Air Am number of the Lomb-LeLea.

The MARTM Mk V (remunder Mk VMCM Mk V in January 1941) was essentially identical to the US Navy F-81, and retained for the four-arm of its American counterpart, Additionally, the same 1200 PM E Wahney R-1830-886 metal engine with a two-stage, two-speed superbacher and varying configuration was retained.

Two Wildcat Mk Vs were completed in 1942, with an additional 309 being completed in 1943 before reproduction without over the FM-2/Wildcat Mk V. These aren't succeed British serial numbers V322 through UR366, Wildcat Mk Vs began in approximately in the Fall of Wildcat, but certain in the type of hot car the place until February of 1944.

Several Wildcat Mk Vs were assigned to 831 Squadron and the second evertic MIPS PUNRSPR, which was providing money soon served services. This Squadron's Wildcat Mk Vs takes about one Heitable He 117 and one-Fowler R-20 during the evening of 12 February 1944.

During Operation TUNGSTEN in April of 1944, Wildcat Mk Vs were enrolled in several of the carriers in the existing group unit to shift the German batelight TRIPMET. One of the sequences involved was No. 831, which was still embarked on PURSUR. The new major engagement that saw the Wildcat Mk V in Station was operation ANVIL-DRAGOON, the invasion of Southern France in August of 1944.

Throughout their service, Wildcat Mk Vs were embarked on the Royal Navy Fs of escort carriers, participating in anti-subtrailar warfare, carryos, and light partners of coastal installations. Wildcat Mk Vs also serve in the Far East. No 834 Squadron maintained a short-based detachment of six aircraft in India for a time.

The Wildcat Mk V equipped 36 EAA squadoms - more squadoms than any other Marte/Wildcat Mk Vs made a good accounting of themselves in combat, while others were teleplated to mitigate any support radio
