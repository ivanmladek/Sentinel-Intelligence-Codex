In 1939, the US Army issued a proposal that called for an F15 156-type STOU aircraft. Twelve US aircraft manufacturers submitted ideas and proposals. The Army selected designs from Bellanca, Ryan, and Stinson and issued contracts for three prototype aircraft from these firms in 1940. These prototypes were built and then delivered to Wright Field, Ohio for testing. Bellanca Aircraft for New Castle, Delaware submitted a high-wing monopline designated the **YSO-4**. 240 hr Ranger 7-707 V-12 air-cooled engine powered to a maximum speed of 125 ms (201 sbn). The YSO-50 s5-foot f-inch (16.9 s) wingspaa made it the largest of the three candidate systems.

This Aeroantical of San Diego, California submitted the **YSO-51 Dragonfly**, a high-wing monopline with full width wing flats and increased wing surface area for low-speed flight. It also had leading Handley Brage plus, which were retracted during crussing flight and extended at high angles of Attack (AoA). This slotted aircraft over the wing at high AoA, which delayed scaling and allowed the aircraft to confine flight. The YSO-51 shes the only entrant with tandem open collisions and it was the heaviest of the three finalists at 4206 pounds (1980 s). A 440 hr Praft & Whitney R-985-21 radial engine powered the YSO-51 to a top speed of 130 ms (209 sbn).

Sinson Aircraft of Fort Wayne, Indiana won the Army's 1940 competition. Their **Model 74** - Army designation **YSO-9** was a high-wing monopline with dropping allerous and dropped 2007 when the wave lowered. These airlines increased lift while preserving lateral control. The YSO-49 also had full span flaps and Handley Page leading edge slas. These features allowed the aircraft to take off and land in 200 feet (61 s). The US Army Air Corps awarded Stinson a production contract for 142 **Q-49 Weight** observation aircraft in mid-1940.

The Bellanca YSO-50 (40-741) was the first of three aircraft entered in the US Army's Short Take Off and Landing (STOI) aircraft content in 1940. The YSO-50 had a wingspaa of 55 feet 6 inches (16.9 s) and a length of 35 feet 2 inches (10.2 y). A 425 senger 7-707- air-cooled inline engine powered this aircraft. (Bellanca via Terry Love)

## Stinson L-1 (Q-49) Vigiant

Voltee Aircraft acquired Stinson Aircraft in the Summer of 1940, soon after the US Army Air Corps (USAAC) awarded Stinson the Q-49 contract. Production began at Vuletee's Nashville, Tennessee plant in the latter half of 1940.

The Q-49 was a braced high-wing monogoline with a fixed landing gear. Doped fabric coverd is metal tube framing, while aluminum stainless was used to the forward fuselage and Vulee's Cowling. The Q-49 had a vignged of 50 feet 11 inches (15.5 s), an overall length of 33 feet 2 inches (10.1 s), and a height of 10 feet 2 inches (13.1 s). Its energy weight was 2670 pounds (121.1 s) and is maximum take of weight as 3325 pounds (15083). A 295 m 2V loopwise (121.8 s) and 68.09-12.5%-cylinder at roadlight engine to a two-bodied constant-speed propeller. The Q-49 had a maximum speed of 129 amu (208 s), an occasional cruise speed of 95 hour (153.5 s), and an alls speed of 357 (56.5 s). Its service ceiling was 12,600 feet (5340) and is and is rampe was 280 miles (451 s). The pilot and observer sit an tandem within a fully enclosed cockpit that offered excellent visibility. Q-49 were originally finished in overall units (minimum V1718), thus is shown separately from early 1941 by follow-up 4181 (NANA-613; F53407) upper surfaces over Neutral Gray 43 (F536137) underlines. In April 67-19, the US Army Air Forces (USAAP) discontinued the Q (for Observation) carried in favour of LOF Luizson. This resulted in the Q-49's redesign as the L-1. Stinson Multi 142 0-49s (serial numbers 40-1927291 and 40-310/13142). The US supplied 16 0-49-18 is to Great Britain under Lend-Lease. The Royal Air Force (RAF) designated them as **Vigiant Is**.

The Q-49 was an improved Q-49 with a 13-inch (33 cm) fuselage extension behind the wing root. This increased the overall length to 34 feet 3 inches (10.4 s). Additionally, gross weight increased to 3400 pounds (1542 kg). The Q-494 could be filled with two EDO Model 77 amphibous float for waterborne operation. Each front had a retractable nose and main wheel for land positions. Stinson completed 182 0-4984 (41-18900/19801), which were redesignated as L-IAS in 1942. One Q-49 was designated as CQ-2 and used to remotely control aerial targets. The US seat 55 0-49/A-L/s to Great Britain, which designated them against LAs.

Four Q-49 were converted to ambulate duties and designated as **Q-49B**s. This conversion included modifying the right fuselage side behind the wing root by removing the glazing and adding a fold down door to receive a jitter. The Q-49B was designated as **L-1B**s in 1942.

The Eagle-LX on an L-1 modified with a rear fuselage loading hatch and a cabin model to accept a later. This aircraft here received EDO Model 77 tons and was designated as **L-IE**s. Evaluation, Stinson converted 113-LCs, which retained their original designation.

The **L-I**b was the designation for 21 L-IAs that were converted for glider pickup training out two cable-gupants was installed under the rear fuselage, L-IBs toward Aerons **T-G**s. Ylavpedum **T-G**s, and Paper **T-G**s training gliders.

Seven L-1 ambulate conversions were designated as L-IEs when they were fitted with EDO Model 77 floors. The USAAP delayed model I-IEs to the China-Burna-India (CBD) Theater of Operations from 1943 to 1945.

The last 0-49/L-1 variant was the L-IF, which was the 113 L-1C aircraft fitted with EDO Model 77 amphibous float. Stinson built 324 0-49/L-1 aircraft from 1940 until 1941. These aircraft saw extensive service throughout World War Two, although their liaison work was taken over by later and smaller liaison aircraft.

The Vigilant's size made it to large for most fusion missions, which were flown by smaller aircraft. (USAAP)
The sole L-1C (formerly O-40C) was a site-to-I-A modified for the ambulance role. A loading batch replaced the upper base-ago observers' canopy and the rear cockp was modified to accept a patient on a filter. Handling gear ratings were removed to facilitate fixing from rough and mudry. The overall aluminum Vightal has a Bright Red cowing and at fuselage cross.

## Taylorcraft L-2 (O-57) Grasshopper

On 2 June 1991, the US Army requested three manufacturers- Taylorcraft, Aeronco, and Pipher - to each provide four light aircraft. These aircraft were to be evaluated during maneuvers being held in mid to late 1994. The Taycraft Aviation Company of Alliance, Ohio responded with their **Model DC-65**, a high-wing magazine tandem-coated trainer. These air-speeds were fitted with a new and painted blue Dweb over North Gray with US Army Air Force (USAR) Philips. The DC-65 receiver the USAR registration **Y-O-57**.

The YO-57 and a fiducial-covered metal tube structure and a fixed landing gear. It had a **in-**s**nvironment of 35 feet 5 inches (10.8 h), a length of 22 feet 9 inches (6.9 u), and a height of 6 feet 8 inches (3.8 h), thereby using 860 pounds (308 k) and the maximum discret width was rated 1200 pounds (544 k).65 h/s Content Company YO-170-3 four-cylinder, air-cooled, horizontally-opposed ("flat") engine tunnel to a two-bloded wooden fixed-point problem. This engine gave the aircraft a maximum speed of 93 wm (500 s). The YO-57's range was 230 mips (370 sth) with the 18-gallon (681.1) maximum fuel capacity. The US Army marked four YO-57's central numbers 42-54255/455 under a contract with 513,8888 and delivering some in 11 September 1994. In 1992 for our YO-57's headless A-2-D.

Following field evaluations, a follow-out contract was signed for 20 additional aircraft (42-7777792) and **Q-57**. The O-57 was essentially a YO-57's with a production standard 65 in Continental O-170-3 engine. A contract for 50 more 0-57's (43-25892098) soon followed. These aircraft offered severe as **L-2A-78** in 1992. At (20A the USAR code for "Yo-Taycraft.3) bits time, the O-57 and other light observation aircraft were dubbed "Grasshoppers" for their ability to take off and land from the unimproved grassfields.

In 1992 Taycraft introduced a modified version of the O-57 that featured a cut down traffic deck. This was the area between the after two great and the base of the horizontal skultimeter. The reduced traffic deck involved visibility to the top, side, and rear. This variant was also equipped with an observer's seat that could take 1987 and an SBC-5855 radio. The new Grasshopper was originally designated the O-57a, but the 336 aircraft ordered (42-5073158 and 42-532586704) entered USAR service as **L-2A-78**. Taycraft built 140 motor aircraft (24-398837857) and 43-257525853 (designated as **L-2A-7A**s.

The 490 L-2B-TAs (43-001/490) were L-2A modified for the US Army Field Atillery. These aircraft had additional equipment for artillery cooling, including range finders. The UASSM2752 551m commands for rotating duties. These included 13 Model DC65 (**L-2C**), on Model DC65 (**L-2C**), such **Model DC65 (**L-2F**s), such **Model DC65 (**L-2F**s), **for Model DC65 (**L-2G**s), and **Model DC65 (**L-2L**), for **Model DC65 (**L-2B**s), for **Model DC65 (**L-2B**s), for **Model DC65 (**L-2B**s), for **Model DC65 (**L-2B**s), and **model DC67 (**L-2B**s)**.

The L-2B-TAs was a modified L-2B with a fully enclosed close engine engine cowling using guiding isotopes to improve soft field findings. Additionally, standard USAR ram instruments were lifted along with improved radios for air-to-ground communications. Taycraft built 900 L-2B-TAs (43-2589205735), which brought total 0-57-7-2 production to 1800 aircraft (including the four YO-57's) by 1943.

Tylcraft's **Model DC1700** was an unpowered 0-57-7-2 collider version, which the USAR designated as the **TC-6**. This was a much-modified Model by civilian timer whose engine and led system were removed. An enlarged nose accommodated an instructor and two students under an expanded greenhouse. This increased the TG-6's length to 25 feet 2 inches (7.7 u) - (2 feet 5 inches (7.0 u) longer than the L-2. Additionally, the heightened nose compensated for the engine's lost weight and preserved the glider's weight and balance. Further modifications included an enlarged vertical subitizer and shortened main landing gear stubs. The TG-6 uti

## Aeronca L-3 (O-58) Grasshopper

The Aeronca Aircraft Company of Middletown, Ohio was the second of three manufacturing-n to provide flight aircraft for US Army evaluation during the 1941 maneuvers. Following these tests, an 511,326 contract was issued for four YQ8-48 (42-456493). This was the military version of Aeronca's Model 65T Defender high-wing monopline with the addition of a military radio and Olivo Dmb over Neutral Gray comfange partic scheme.

The YQ-58 was a broad high-wing monopline with fixed handling gear. It had aluminum, reset hating, and wood structure with a coldcourse. The YQ-58 had a nitrogen of 35 feet through 370, and a length of 126 cm (16.7 s, and a height of 6 feet 1 inch (2.8 s). The empty weight was 835 pounds (379 xc) and the maximum takeoff weight was 1260 pounds (572 xc).

A 65 mC commercial YQ-170-3 four-cylinder, air-cooled, horizontally-speeding pentap truck no-haded wooden freaf-pitch propeller. This powerful gave the YQ-58 a maximum speed of 587 x (137 s)omb, the aircraft had a service ceiling was 140,006 (after 3170 s) and time was 232 ms (207 s, 308 s), two-mm new consisted of a pilot and observer sitting in tandem. No standard armament was fitted to this and other light observation aircraft; however, each crewman was usually issued with a 545enter (1120) Cott M1911 pilot. Additionally, the crew was sometimes issued in the 4.45 AUther M3 submming gun (pera \(\gamma\)) or \(\lambda\) Osillery (6220) M1 extinction. The four YQ-58s eventually became **O-58s** and then redesigned as **L-3s** in April of 1942.

In 1942, the US Army issued a follow-on contract for 50 additional O-58s (43-280/258s). A production standard 65 mCentional O-170-3.engine powered the O-58 and the only other two change was shape of the air on-chip side-lines. The YQ-58s interagued side windows were changed to oval-shaped windows. Most O-588/L-3 were employed on statewide training studies during World War Two.

The O-58A was designed with a four-inch (10.2 cm) wider fuselage and a modified observatory's window arrangement. These changes increased the maximum gross weight to 1350 pounds (612 xc). Aeron couldn built 20.58s (42.77978/128), which were designated as L-As in 1942.

The O-58B was based on the O-58A, but with a modified glass enclosure, additional radio equipment, and a gross take of weight raised to 1825 pounds (382 xc). Despite the increased weight, the maximum speed actually increased its 887 turn (142 xc), O-58B reduction total 335 aircraft (42-417/317497 and 24-367/56324). In 1942, the O-58B became the L-3B.

The L-3C was identical to the L-3B, except with a radio equipment fitted. Most L-3Cs went to the War Training Service (WTS) of the Civil Aeronca Administration (CA) for basic flight marking during World War Two. Aeronca without 400-3Cs (43-147/1960) during 1943. The US Navy received three L-3Cs designated as **JR-1s** and stationed them at Brown Field, Naval Auxiliary Air Station (SAV) Maps Mess, California. Aeron completed 899 O-58L-3 aircraft for the USAware between 1941 and 1943.

The USAware increased 48 civilian models into service service during World War Two. These included 11 Model 65T Defenders (L-3B), **12 Model 65T Defenders (L-3B), 9 Model 65T Defenders (L-3B), for **Model 65T Defenders (L-3B), for Model 65T Defenders (L-3B)**, and one additional Model 65T Defenders (L-3B). These aircraft were used for training and back (utility) duties.

Aeros designed and built a glider version of the L-3, which was designated the **TG-5**. The L-3's engine and legged system were removed, while the fuselage and canopy were extended forward by 1 feet 9 inches (0.5 s) to accommodate a third crewmenmen. This increased the TG-5's length to 23 feet 1 inches (7.2 s). Additionally, the main landing gear was modified (The Civil Aeronca Administration (CA) was established in 1940 as to US air traffic control, internal and aircraft confection, duty enforcement, and airways development. The CA was removed the Federal Aviation Agency in 1958, in 1967, this agency was removed for the Federal Aviation Administration (AAAA).

The US Army processed four YQ-58 Grasshoppers for testing their feasibility in performing fusion missions, much as the Jegel did on the ground.

## Piper L-4 (O-59) Grasshopper

The Piper Aircraft Company of Lock Haven, Pennsylvania was the third of three manufacturers the US Army connected in mid-1941. Piper provided eight J-3C-48 Cab aircraft for US Army Air Force (USAAF) evaluation during military exercises held that year. The J-3C-65s were delivered in civilian Yellow pump finish with an exterior of a grasshopper smoking cigarette on the faceing sides. Some of these Cubs were eventually printed in the then-standard camofee scheme scheme of Olive Drab 41 (AN-4316; F33807) upper surfaces and Neutral Gray 43 (FS36173) undersurfaces, with a White smoking grasshopper on the fuselage. These aircraft were successfully employed during maneuvers held at Fort Bites, Texas in July of 1941. This led the US Army to issue a contract for Piper J-3C-65 Cubs (serial numbers 4-2604063), which were designated as **YO-59s**.

The T0-95 was a based high-wing magazine with a fixed landing gear. It was constructed of steel and aluminum with a wood wing spor and covered by doped fabric. The YO-59 had a winging of 356 feet 2 inches (10.7 M.), a length of 22 feet 4 inches (6.8 M), and a height of 6 feet 8 inches 20. All 65 newly eight 370 pounds (336 x6) and the maximum takeoff weight was 1220 pounds (553 x60).

A 65 cm (roundization-170x-four-cylinder, air-cooled, horizontally-opposed "(Tit)" engine at the rotated-based wooden fixed-point) profile. This powerful gave the YO-59 a top speed of 87 mm (140x 80x). It had a service ceiling of 11.500 feet (3505 x0) and a range of 260 cavities (418 x80x). The two ramu crew - pilot and observer - sat in tandem within the enclosed rock. The USAAF redesignist is Observation aircraft as L-asion aircraft in April of 1942, and the four YO-59s became L-48. Four L-4s were supplied to Great Britain, which design- and then Cub Is for evaluation.

The **O-59** was the initial production model, with Piper completing 140 aircraft (423-173925). For O-59s were used during maneuvers held in Mississippi, Tennessee, and Texas driving August and September of 1941. Each O-59 - equipped with a 6-orbit electrical system and military radio equipment - cost S22300.00. The O-59 was redesigned as the L-4 in 1942.

The **O-59A** was an improved O-59 with an enlarged and widener observer's position. This allowed the rear seat to rotate 180Â° and face transferred. Additionally, the observer's glass was inserted to the side and have an inverted roomed to 5-7A/-2A. Piper built full 671-09.As (42.5159159329 and 42.36235/6824), which were renamed L-4s in the Spring of 1942. A further 277 aircraft was used as **L-4s** (PI was the USAAF code for Piper) and assigned seat numbers -23.383083457 and 43 -29048229246.

The L-4A was the first of the first eight aircraft to go to war. This position free occurred during the Allied invasion of French North Africa (Oberation TORD). On 9 November 1942, three L-A was free from the deck of the aircraft curse NAS RANGER (CV-4) to provide artillery observation for the large US naval guns. These L-4s had Orange-Follow (NAA-614; S383538) cowlines and on-range. Yellow ring around the fuselage national inspirations for identification. Many L-4s served in the training role in the US and were painted overall maintaining Open/S177178.

The **980 L-4s** (43-491/1470) prevented for the US Army Field Artillery was similar to the L-4s, but without radios or an electrical system. It was discovered after L-4s were delivered to various artillery aviation units that that obliged Carofighters while the Grasshoppers' operation of trimu uninfected airfils. This resulted in a carounter at filter being installed in the front lower owing, which kept part of the engine. Some L-4s were recorded with SCR-610 radio transmitterreceivers that operated on frequencies compatible with ground units' radios. The British Royal Air Force (RAF) used one L-4B that was serialized VM286.

The USAAF increased 107 civilian Cubs into service. These included eight **Model J-3Ls**The second YO-59 (42-46f) is tied down near a filling station gas pump at Hawkins Field, Jackson, Mississippi 07 in September 1941. A feed cross pointed on the Unstable ion-nucleus eastisem in the Red Force for the maneuve. The Grassberger used civilian automobile fuel, which was approximately 30-octane in 1941. Eventually, 8087-octane aviation fuel was used as the aircraft were integrated into service. The drag cone onto the rudder pulls a low frequency wire radio antenna to various lengths behind the aircraft. This tunes the radio to the proper frequency. (Borahromian, C. Eged) (designated L-ACs), five Model J-As (L-Abs), 17 Model J-As (L-Abs), 43 Model J-SAs (L-Abs), and 34 Model J-SBs (L-Ac), Seven Cubs were impressed inmann and employed as light cargo aircraft. The four 1-5As were designated as UC-ks, two J-3As, and one 1-4-Na renamed UC-ks (N-Abs). The British also impressed a number of civilian Cubs for use as trainers and unit hacks. The L-Abs was moved version of the L-Abs. The L-Abs was not fitted with an electrical system or radio equipment, but did receive an upgraded hydraulic braking system. A one-piece windshield related the three space windshield installed on either aircraft. First completed 1880 L-418 (43-2924057) and 47-519580044) the most widely produced variant of the early fusion aircraft.

The **L-J4** was the last wartime 1-65 cubic production model, with 1680 aircraft built (44-80045/80844, 45-4401/5200, and 45-55175/55254). This variant was nearly identical to the L-J4-RI, but some L-48 replaced the first-night peptide with a Beed-Roy controllable pitch propeller. This was intended to improve tick off performance. The Beed-Roy complex were not successful and were not well with a fixed pitch. Upper bait 5553 L-48 for the USAar during World War Two.

The US Navy also prevented J-3C-65s directly from Piper and designated them as **NE-k:** N designated Trainer and E was the Navy's designator for Piper Aircraft. The Navy acquired 230 NE-1s and they were assigned Buxen Numbers (Bulsos) of 226196 through 226425. The NE-1 featured dual controls and was painted either overall Orange/Corup or Aluminum. Twenty additional aircraft (Bulsos 2966/952688) were later ordered and were designated NE-2. These aircraft were similar to the Army's L-J4 and were equipped with controllable pitch propellers.

The TB-I was the US Navy's designation for 100 modified Piper-J5C Cab Cru Cruisers acquired in 1942. These aircraft had a modified turtle deck that was hinged upward at the front. ThisThe third production O-59 (42-7815) was essentially a civilian -330-65 Cube equipped with a military radio. The Grasshopper was evaluated at Wright Field and was camoufled in Orphe Orbit Target Orbit, with the national insigma in four positions (both fuselage sides, upper left, and lower right wing).

Some U-4 were also fitted with bonus hacks and armed with hand greandes. One L-4 was actually credited with destroying a few German tanks.

The L-4 played an important role during World War Two, providing everything from pilot training to military spotting, ambulance dates, to - in a few cases - attack aircraft. When the filter yellow civilian Paper Cube out to war as the L-4 Grasshopper, it would soon be bestowed the mixture 'Murg Measurement'. This referred to the US's appearance manufacturer Mayus and the German Mess Messembitt [196]. The L-4 went to observe in the Korean War (1950-1953) until the Cessan L-19 (later O-1) Bird Dog replaced the Grasshopper during the early 1950s.

The howniters were assigned to the 26th Infantry Division, which assaulted Omaha Beach in _Normandy_, France on June 1944 (D-Day). The L-4's small size and low and slow flying ability made in an excellent platform for artillery observation and spotting. Piper completed 5853 L-4s during World War Two, which made this aircraft the most produced of the wartime L-thirds. (US Army)

## Stinson L-5 (0-62) Sentinel

In 1941, the USA/STAR issued a contract to the Valtech-Silton Aircraft Company of Wayne, Michigan. This contract called for 275 O-62s, a military version of the Stinson **Model 105 Voyager**. The Army's version had an increased with fuselage and military radios. Voltage had purchased Stinson Aircraft in mid-1940 so they could build Valtech aircraft - including the 4.31 and 4.33 Voyager chive-bowners and the 0-94/1. Viplant - using Stinson's production facilities.

The **0-62AST** (ST being the USA/AF's code for Stinson) was a based high-wing monopoline with fixed handling gear. It had wooden wing spas and ribs and welded steel tubing for the fuselage structure. The aircraft employed a droplet fakii. Then the 0-62 had a suspension of 34 feet (0.44), an overall length of 24 feet in 11.2 (3.7), and a height of 7 feet in 1 inch (2.2). All subsequent O-62/L-5s had the same dimensions. Its empty weight was 1472 pounds (668 x) and the maximum hexelt weight was 2158 pounds (979 x). A 185 \(\mu\)m Wyoming O-435-1 is six-cylinder, air-cooled, horizontally-oppage granite turned a two-blood wooden fixed height.

The 0-62 had a maximum speed of 129 mph (208 mph) and an economical cruise speed of 100 mph (161 mph). Wing leading edge slots and slotted trailing edge flugs allowed the Sentinel to land at 54 mph (724 mph). No service paths were 15.00 feet (4816 m) and its range was 450 times (724 mph). The two-arm crew of pilot and observer start in a nonquin within the fully enclosed cockpit.

The 275 O-62 (42:1479815072) followed from late 1941 were designated **L-5s** in April of 1942. Value also produced 1731 **L-5-W**V (V for Viveive; W for Wayne, Michigan) aircraft (142.1479815072 and 249.809069573).

Value converted 688.15 to **L-5s** in 104 s. A 24-volt electrical system replaced the earlier 12-volt system. This allowed for installing upgraded radios, which enabled 1.5\(\_\)As to communicate with attack aircraft. No serial numbers were subject out and the designated was not on the aircraft's data plate.

The **L-5B** featured a modified fuselage octuling of holding 200 pounds (91 x6) or cargo or a target point on a filter. The filter was loaded through an upward fined bag door on the right upper fuselage side. The fuselage was designed and the observer's windows were changed. Vulice completed 730 **L-5s** (299:499749753 and 44:160377252) from 1943. A few L-5Bs were fitted with upper nose hooks beginning of flight Drakeive-equipped US Navy LSTs. Twin fluts sometimes replaced the L-5B's landing gear for watering operation. The float equipped L-5B had a ventral fan did under the rear breakage. This fin increased stability and compressed for aerodynamic changes caused by the float installation.

The 200 L-5s (44:125371472) were identical to L-5s, but were fitted with provisions and electrical equipment for L-5B's-20 earl camera. The 20 was installed within lower fuselage brackets and operated by the pilot or observer.

The USA/AF canled the **L-5B** before any aircraft were built and did not assign any serial numbers. It is believed that variant would be equipped with Handley-Page leading edge slats as on the 0-94/1. These slats would have further improved the Sentinel's low speed performance.

The **L-5B** was similar to the L-5C, but with dropping alleers that lowered with the flaps. These modified control surfaces improved the aircraft's low speed performance. Additionally, a stirurg step added to the lower fuselage aided entry to the observer's rear seat position. Value built 750 **L-5s** (44:17453/18202) from late 1943.

An L-5B (44:1703) was reconfigured during production into the **XL-5F**. A 185 **tr** Lycoming on 435-23x-cylinder, air-cooled, horizontally-opposed engine replaced the 0-435-1 of the same horsepower. The XL-5F was converted back to L-5B standards following the engine tests.

The last Sentinel production variant was the L-5G, which was an L-5F with a 190 \(uv\) L-Lycoming O-435-11 six-cylinder, air-cooled, horizontally-opposed engine. The L-5G featured enlarged wheels and directs, thus an improved baseline system for superior rough field performance. An improved SCR-27AN radio was installed for communicating with ground forces and other aircraft. The slightly increased frequency gave the L-5G a maximum speed of 130 (MP) (2098), despite a gross weight that increased to 22000 (998 \(\pm\) 60). Value built 115-C6s (45-3491/135/2015) in the World War Two. This brought total Sentinel production during World War Two to 3501 aircraft. One additional L-5G (97287) was completed as a Spider for the US Air Force in Colorado Springs, Colorado in 1957. The USAAR also increased civilian Voyagers into wartime service. These included eight **Model I Voyagers (L-0B)** and 12 Model **10A Voyagers (L-0B)**.

L-5s saw extensive liaison and observation service with US Army units in Europe, the Pacific, and the China-Burnma-India (CBI) Theater of Operations. The Sentinel's 15,800-foot service coins was expected in the CBI, where the 1st Air Command Group and other units fleve missions near the Himalayan Mountain range. The US supplied 100 L-S- to the British, who designated them **Sentinel I** and **Its**. Royal Air Force units fleve Sentients in the CBI Theater.

The USAAR unfered 360 L-S of several variants to the US Navy during World War Two. The Navy assigned these aircraft to the US Marine Corps under the designation **OY**. (0 stood over observation, while V designated Consolidated, which acquired Valle in 1943). Most Scientists were standard configuration **OY-1s**, but at least 29 aircraft were modified with ambulance equipment and designated as **OY-2s**. The Marines fleve VOVs in the Pacific Theater.

The US Army, Air Force, and Marines deployed L-5s to Korea in 1950. They fleve Forward Air Control (PAC) missions alongside North American T-6 Teams that were nicknamed 'Mosquitoes.' Surviving L-5-VWs and L-5G-VWs were redesignated as U-19A-VWs and rescue missions. GUINEA SHORT LINES is painted in White above a White Kangaroo on the **Sentinel's evolving.

An L-5E (44-1712) from an unidentified unit makes a flight in 1944. The L-5E was basically an L-5C equipped with alternons that 'dropped (lowered) in conjunction with the flaps. These 'dropped' alternons improved short field take off and landing capabilities. A strong-type tests was added to the lower right fuselage. This added in landing stretchers and cargo. Stinson completed 750 L-8Es from late 1943 until 1944. (US Army)
