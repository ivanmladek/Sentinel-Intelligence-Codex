## Introduction

The planning for what would become the Me 210, began during 1937, when the Messemmitt design team began woo. on a new heavy flight-bomber to replace the Bf 110 which had revealed a number of shortcomings. The design, as envisioned by the _Reichelbaffaffungungungung_, or R.L.M., was to have been an improved version of the Bf 110, capable of undertaking the roles of buoyancy "destroy", reconnaissance and drive-bomber, with more powerful engines and increased free-power. Construction of the prototype was initiated during 1938 and the first aircraft, the Me 20 V1 (radio code D-A2P, Werk. IN200001), made its first flight 2 September1939.

The 210V-1 was a low-wing emitter monogine, with vein vertical at surfaces, very similar to the earlier 110. The flaggite profile, however, differed markedly from the earlier fighter. The new aircraft had a very blunt nose and a squat feeling with a bubble type canopy for the pilot and radio-poerner.

It was powered with two 1,050 hp Daminer-Benz D601A-1 liquid-cooled engines. After the first fist flights, the test pilot, Dr. Ingram Winter, reported that the new aircraft possessed very hot flying characteristics, with poor lateral and longitudinal stability.

The second prototype, the Me 210V-2 (radio code WL-ABEO, Werk. IN200002) was modified and fitted with a single fan under-hoc. The second prototype also differed from its predecessor in having a cockp entry with bulged side windows and mock-ups of the remote controller, re-firing matching patterns on the east side of the fausheek, break turter was to contain a 138M chilling pen. The airwatch had one tour of the two "quets" of the Me 210V-3, which were swept back some freegers and using mounted dye brakes. Even with these changes, the aircraft was still extremely unstable and eventually cracked off. September 1940, which on a flight to conduct further tests with _Fndagglab_ Fritz Woodel at the controls. The V-3 prototype's fasheek was assigned to test role.

The V-4 prototype (radio code CF-BB, Werk. IN200001) was the first of some fifteen _Fynst_s (experimental) machines, each being assigned to test modifications, equipment installations and the items of equipment themselves. The remaining thirteen prototypes were completed during the spring and early Summer of 1941.

The Me 210V-5 and V-9 were used to test wing modifications, the V-6, V-10 and V-11 were used to test general flight handling characteristics and the V-7 and V-8 were used to test de-icing and landing gear modifications. The Me 210V-12 had experimental dive brakes and

**The 210V-1 prototype had twin vertical stabilizers, similar to those used on the earlier BT 110. The port propeller is Reinbered, indicating that the aircraft had an engine problem in flight. (Mohr)**

As it finally emerged, the Messerschmitt Me 210 was a twin-engine, low wing, all metal, two-scat mesophane fighter. The wings were of all metal construction and were built in three pieces, two outer wing panels and a wing center condition. The wing had slat-type disc-breakes fitted and below the centre wings, just outbound of the engine mechlies, and behind the wing main parts. These air brakes were hydrophillically operated. The alternons were fabric covered.

The fuselage was a light alloy monocroscope structure with a single vertical stabilizer. The roadless and elevators were also fabric covered, the receipt of the pilot and radio-poernerner summer was corvert with a bubble type canopy, with budget sides and an arm glass shield.

The undercarriage retracted rearward, with the main landing gear wheels resting in hys within the engine mechlies and being fully enclosed by biased doors on the rear of the mechlies. The tail wheel was also fully retraculers, reacting mo a bay in the rear portion of the fasheek. The aircraft was powered by 1,050 hp Daminer-Benz D601a-60002 siting hydraulically operated V,D.M. three-badd, constant speed, all metal peopleless.

Amanmanent specified for the Me 210 consisted of two 20MM Mo 151 cameras with 350 rounds each and two 7,9MM Mo 17 pairs with 1,000 rounds, firing from the extreme nose and two 13MM Mo 131 runs with 600 rounds in the remotely controlled gun discures on either side of the fuselage. These runs were connected by the radio-coordinator?. A bomb by

Me 210A Series

Me 210A-0

By the late Spring of 1941, both the Augsburg and Regensburg factories had initiated assembly of the 210A-0 pre-production series (which would come to include some inter-form aircraft), with the first aircraft drilling out during April.

The Me 210A-0 was basically identical to the late prototypes, with the exception of the engines. The Me 210A-0 utilized 1305 hp laminate-Benz DB-601F liquid-cooled engines in place of the earlier 1,050 hp-601A-el engines.

The Me 210A was intended to be a heavy fighter with a secondary capability as a fighter-bonbonber/five number. A comprehensive service evaluation of the Me 210A-0 was begun during late 1941 and it was found that the earlier prototypes were too few in number to complete all the testing needed. As a result, eight Me 210A-0 was ever lost to join the test program. We see 210A-0 was used mostly flight from A Voss a full control trainers to aid in the pilot conversion program. By the end of 1941, it had been determined that the Me 210A-0 had too many shortcomings, particularly in stability, for it be a suitable combat aircraft. Despite this evaluation, production was to continue and two additional variants, the Me 210A-1 and 210A-2 were reduced into production.

One Me 210A-0 (NEB4H, Work Nr.101) was modified with a lengthened rear fuselage, being designated the Me 210A-1/07 on 14 March 1942. A comparison between this aircraft and the Me 210A-1 left table down the modification had a positive effect on the aircraft's handling qualities. In July of 1942, another Me 210A-0 aircraft was fitted with wing leaking edge acts. This modification was found to drastically improve the aircraft's characteristics in a side slip and these slats were ordered to be reformed to all Me 210A.

**Thirty-eight early production Me 210 investigates line either side of the assembly hall during 1942. (Ratherop)**

## Me 210a-1

The first Me 210A-1 heavy fighter rolled out in November of 1941. The Me 210 A-1 carried a forward-firing amament of two 200at MG 151 cannos and two 7.99atm MG 17 machine guns in the nose and two 13atm MG 131 weapons in the FDL 131 fuselage side gun positions.

## Me 210a-2

The Me 210A-2 was a fighter-banner variant of the Me 210 and was similar to the Me 210A-1 except for the bomb. Me The Me 120 A-2 was essentially a five-banner with a limited heavy fighter capability, carried an internal bomb load of one 2.20at and (1.000 kg) PC 10008s bomb or two 1,102 found (500kg SD 500) bombs, or two 551 spend (250kg SC 250) bomb on step of 110 pomut (50kg SC 500). This bomb load was augmented by four 110 pomut (50kg SC 500) bombs under using rads mounted under the wing center section. During all of 1942, front line units equipped with the Me 210 move suffering an unacceptable accident rate and both Messerschmitt workshops, Augsburg and the MIAG at Braunschweig were ordered to halt Me 210 production and a commission was established to investigate the program. Apart from the **(Venvards (test) aircraft, one inner-to-M6 210A-10)** to **as** and three 210A-1 versus had the net assemblies line, while a further 370 were in various stages of construction. In addition, materials and main components had been prepared for an additional 800 machines.

Tests had revealed that the happened face and wing slats cured most of the poor handling problems with the Me 210A-1 and producing swanted one again, with the intent to rebuild existing the 210A-1s and the 210A-2s with the new breakage and to complete those aircraft that had been near completion at the time of production termination. In 1942 some money-five aircraft were delivered, followed by eightty-nine in 1943 and seventy-four in 1944. Most of these later aircraft did not reach front-line units and many were disassembled to provide parts for Me 410s then entering production.

## Me 210 in German Service

The first Me 210A-0s left the assembly lines in early 1940 and were delivered to _Erpendaswenger 120_. This third Me been formed in July of 1940 with the assigned task of conducting operational testing the Me 210 and developing combat tactics for the fighter-bonner. Initially equipped with a number of BP 109s and BP 110s while waiting for delivery of the Me 210s, the unit commended operators are England in the Summer of 1940. The first leader of the _Grupey_ was _Hasquermann_ Walter Ruchschorffer, who was killed, along with his radio-port/powerpower, while lying at 1100 in a mission over England. Until the Summer of 1941, _Erpendaswenger 120 was only L'atharke unit flying the Me 210 and its reports on the flight characteristics for the new fighter were from complementary. At this same time the unit is not another key leader, _Oberberatur_ (First Lieutenant Heirurgach, of _J.SSG 210_ who was killed at Rechlin on 23 September194 while testing Me 210.

Even so, the Latharke issued the Me 210A-1 to _ILZerererererererererererer_ during the Winter of 1944LAe. The unit, deployed on the Eastern Front was re-equipped with the new aircraft belt, after a short period of operations, the unit gain at-equipped, this time with BP 110s. After the Me 210A was put through a series of modifications, the rebuilt Me 210A-1s were issued to a special experimental unit, designated _Verasstoffoff 120_, which achieved operational status during August of 1942, based at Sesterberg in central Holl. Once the unit had become operational under _LaHoffline_ 3, its designer was changed to _I.6&G_. After the Me 210A-1 (St.20, Week Nr. 2058) was involved in a landing accident with an Italian Savoia-Jarcheheil S.M. at Leece during January of 1943.

## Messerschmitt Me 210Ca-1

Under the German-Hungarian Mutual Arment Program, which had been finalized in June of 1981 for the production of 8170, 3rd 210 (later Mate 410), Junkers No 52 and Arado At 96, the _Dunal Repidisgrgrgrgrgr_ (Dunne Alcrati Factory) at Herlopfiger was established for the license manufacture of both engines and affirms. The factory was provided with all the necessary machine-tools and jigs been needed to begin production directly from Messerschmitt.

One Me 210 A-0 (radio code PN-PD, Web Nr. 2100105) was re-engineed with 1,475 bp DB 6058 engines without MW 1 Methanol injection. This aircraft served as a pattern aircraft for the 210 and was used with the lengthed fresingen and using leading edge-sites. The aircraft was to be built in two variants, the Me 210C-1 and Me 210C-1 (roughly equal to the The 210A-1 and Me 210A-2). Other than the engines, the Hungarian produced variants were the same as the modified Me 20A Es being assembled by Messerschmitt.

The first Hungarian Me 210C-1 (radio code RP-FA, Web Nr. 210001) made its first test flight on 21 December 1941, with test pilot Captain Dines Esteqvi at the controls. After a series of successful test flights _(Theoretical Ministation/Ministation Defense)_ ordered the 210 into production with a short production of five machines.

The German-Hungarian Committee concluded an agreement under which the Hungarian factory would produce 557 Messerschmitt Me 210A and 817 Me 410B-1, with two flights of all Hungarian produced aircraft going to the Lafluafle. The first three Me 210C-1a (RP-PA, RF-PA

Me 410

Messerschmidt's next proposal was for a high altitude fighter/bombher with a pressurized cockpit and two 1/7.05 Db 060A engines. The arrangement was specified with the b. the same as that of the Me 210A-1. Various improvements were to have been incorporated, such as an increase in using spun to fifty-eight feet eight and three quarter inches and the installation of four blade propellers. The first was anticipated to have a maximum speed of 419 mph at 36,090 feet. The thirteenth Me 210A-1(V+N+Q, Wek 1201709) was modified to this standard and from 11 September 1994. Two versions were postponed, the Me 310A-1 final chamber and the Me 310A-2 destroyed, by the end of 1943, that filter development of Me 310 was abandoned because it showed no major advantage over the Me 210.

The next design based on the 210 ms data was the Me 410 Homplates (Homer). The aircraft was essentially a Me 20A-1 with a lenghtened foliage, using slats and re-enghined, with 1,750 lb DB 603A engines in a lenghtened engine excelelel. The basic structure of the design remained the same as its predecessor, except that the user of the outbound wing panels was redesigned. This was due to the fact that the five degree sweep back out the Me 210 wing was eliminated and the wing fitted with automatic leading edge slats. The geometry of the hydraulic/bordord cannot change"changing flaps was modified and the radiator flaps and the radiators were also redesigned.

The Me 410V-1 prototype (D1-NW, Werk Nr. O27) was completed and few near the end of 1942. After a series of successful tests using six modified Me 210A, the R.L.M. operated the Me 410 into production. One of the modified Me 210s used in the test program was later supplied to Japan under the Nippon-German Technical Exchange Agreement. More than twenty Years (cepetirentical) aircraft were involved in the test program, mainly converted from Me 210 airframes, although a number were new-built aircraft.

The Me 410V-1 prototype (Wek Nr. O27) was originally built as an Me 210A-O. The aircraft was modified with DB 603A engines, lenghtened rearstage and new wings during 1942. This aircraft was later assigned to IL/ZO 1 as a Me 410A-1. (Dressed)

Production of the first variant, the Me 410A-1, began during January of 1943 and the first five aircraft were accepted by the Luffuffray by the end of the month. The Me 410A-1 was a light bomber with the standard Me 210 amamment of four machine spins and two caomons, plus various bomb loads in the internal bomb by and an external bomb rack located under each viewing root. Production purity was given to this variant, since the _OberThe A-1 series used one of two different spin signals, either a Revi (_Reflexivity_) C 12/D or ZFR (_Zelferlaw_) ZFR 4A, later redesignated the Revi 16B. For bombing, the Me 410A-1 was equipped with a Sivu 58 Gb five-bombing sight.

The second main production variant was the Me 410A-2, which was built primarily as a _Zelferlaw_, with the two forward-fitting MG 17 machine guns removed and replaced by two Sohn MX 103 cameras, which were installed in the bomb way. It was built in a number of variations, mainly dealing with an ammer changes.

The Me 410A-2/U was similar to the Me 410A-1/U reconnaissance aircraft. The Me 410A-2/U was a right fighter modification first under that antennas mounted on the noe-beam. The Me 410A-2/U was similar to the A-1/U4, with a Sohn BK 5 common for bomber detectors operating. Other ammerments options included various weapons kits that could be field installed on the Me-410.

Because of problems with the Me 410A-1/U4 and A-2/U1, a specialized reconnaissance variant was produced under the designation Me 410A-3/U3. This variant mounted a pair of Rb 2030, Rb 5030 or Rb 75/50 cameras in the modified bomb bay. The modification of the bomb by led to a deepened nose contour and both MG 17 machine guns were removed.

## Me 410 In Service

The first five production Me 410s were accepted by the Luftawfe in January of 1943 and by the end of April, short forty-eight aircraft had been delivered.

During April and May of 1943, the Me 20 13 aircraft of IMZG 1 _Wegen_ and 2/4/P122 were replaced by Me 410A-1/2/5. One of the first Reich Zenitore (destroy) units to re-equipped with the new type, was _Expendations/commodance_ 25, commanded by _Hungstate_ (Cognia) Eduard Traft in Wintenbrandt. This was a special term to conduct operational tests of new weapons, heavy weapons and products.

In September of 1943, _Hungstate_ Trait _Etch **Erprobawhomande 25** and took over command of IMZG 26 _Hurst Wessel_. This fighter group began operations against the Americans A home Defense until based at Oberpfeldrecht and later Koighingre (Traft et al. one 22 February 1944 in an emergent agential American four-geni phones near Nordhausen). At the time of this death he was an active with a third flight.

S/KG 2 and began conversion from the Do 2171 to the At 410A-1 during April of 1943. Before conversion was complete, the entire _Grupge_ were back to Do 2178 and transferred their Me 410s to 410s. We do 2. This _Grupge_ was to take part, under the command of a _Hungstate_ (Hungstate) Ergeballen, in "Baby Blitz" operators were the British labs during 1943-44. In January of 1944, V/RG 2 was redesigned as II/KG 51 and, together with LKG 51 and the _Geschwater Stab_, began operations under the control of the _Laborfeldrechthaber Mitte_ in France. The unit achieved operational status at Benovas during 1944.

On 2 April 1944, about fifteen Me 410s of KG 51 followed the bombers of the USAFA's The crew of this Me 410A (Week Nr.: 420090) tethioned the canopy before making a bely landing at Oberpfeldrecht/Hungstate/on a October 1944.

2nd Division back to their home bases in England. Shortly after the bounbers landed, the German force attacked, destroying a number of B-24s for the loss of one Me 410 to unit-air-carfraft for. This aircraft (OK-eff); Wer Nr.: 420458 was seen to explore our Ashby, killing the pilot, _Oberpfeldrecht_ (1st Lieutenant) Klaus Kruger and his radio-operator _Fellowed_ (Sergent) Reichard.

By the end of 1943, the Angburg assembly line had delivered some 457 Me 410As to Lafurte units. The first Dornier-built aircraft was accepted in December, but the next eleven were not delivered until the following February.

The first operational casualty of V/RG 2 was US+KG, which was shot down on the night of 13-14 July 1943, a Woshovior XVI of No 58 Squadron near Felixstone, with _Fellowed_ (Sergent) Manifest the controls on _Oberfeldrecht_ (Sergent) Manifest Separation Raith flying as radio-operator/guomer. Another Me 410 (US+C) of V. _Grupge, Kungsforschuder 2_ also was observed by a night fighter Mosquito net Dornik.

During early 1943, American six eastern targets in the Third Rich had not been significant, because they had been far far between and of an experiment nature. Additionally, these risks were modest in scale, invoking only few aircraft. By the Summer of 1943, all this had changed and the nricks increased in their effectiveness.

As a result, the Luftawfe was forced to pull back more and more intense future fronts to form _Fellowedrecht/Hungstate_ (One) defenses units. The twin-engineed _Zerstellers_ were best suited for these units since they had the range to enable them to fight the long air battles with the four-point bombers and had heavier amantant the early single-pened fighter types in service.

During September of 1943, I/ZG 26 _Haust_ Wessel_ began to replace its Me 210s with Me 410A-2/43. After re-equiping with the new aircraft, the _Grupge_ operated with the another great _Harnaeus_ unit, 250 \(R\), against the 8th Army Air Force over Germany, Austria, Hungary
