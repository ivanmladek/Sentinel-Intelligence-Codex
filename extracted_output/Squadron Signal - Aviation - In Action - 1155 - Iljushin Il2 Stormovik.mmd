## Introduction

In the Soviet Union a cumbersome, slow, but heavily armed and armored ground attack aircraft, which was unique in many respects, became one of the most decisive weapons in the inventory of the Red Army.

The Stormovik assault aircraft, as Sergej V. Ilyushin's I-2 was generally called, proved to be exactly what the Red Army needed to support their ground forces against the invading Germans, from the Summer of 1941 to final victory in Berlin on 9 May 1945.

The I-2 Sarmovik was by far one of the most efficient weapons in the _Voyenno-Vedusyability Sld_ (Red Air Force). The Sormovik soon became a nightborne for enemy tanks, motor vehicles, artillery and infantry. The Germans generally referred to the I-2 as the _Schwarter Tod_ (Black Death). I-2 plots five combat sorties at very low levels, flying at altitudes of between thirty and 6,000 feet, armed with a variety of weapons, including machine guns, camon, bombs and reckets.

A dramatic runtime leggram from the Soviet dictator, Isolf Sullin, to the manufacturing plant, reflected the greater importance this aircraft type had in his view. "The Red Army needs the I-2 as it needs air and bread. I urge you to produce more business."

In fact, the I-2 was built in greater numbers than any other combat aircraft during the Second World War, a total of 30,163 I-2s of different versions being delivered. But the attrition rate for the I-2 was higher than any other Soviet type. Statistics reveal that one I-2 was lost for every third vendor sontries. Early in the war, when I-2 units lacked fighter protection, I took rise was even higher. At this time, a I-2 pilot was awarded with the "Heron of the Soviet Union" model stem successful missions.

Sergej Vladimirovich Division designed the I-2 Sormovik. He was born on 31 March 1984, at Mplayeron near Lake Kubens. He began his six aircraft on 1910 and during the First World War he joined the Imperial Russian Air Force as a mechanic. He received his pilots certificate in 1917.

During the bloody Russian civil war, Ilyushin was assigned to the 6th Salvage Group on the Northern Front, tasked with repairing damaged aircraft. In 1921, Ilyushin reported to the Institute of Red Air Fleet Engineers School in Moscow. Within two years, he had begun independent design work, designing three gliders, one of which, the AVF-21 Moskva, took part in a glider competition in Germany during 1925.

In 1933, he became the leader of a design group specializing in the development of a long range bomber and on 17 August 1936, Ilyushin created its own Design Bureau.

Most Red Air Fleet operations during the Civil War were low-level strafing and bombing missions. Contemporary Soviet military thinking emphasized the role of the aircraft in supporting room troops. Hudistorhed reconnaissance, ground attack and close support were seen as the main functions of the Red Air Fleet.

A requirement for a dedicated ground attack aircraft was issued during 1928 and the First Section of the Scientific and Technological Committee of the Board of the Air Force, at that time headed by Ilyushin, worked up the tactical and technical requirements, but Ilyushin was not involved with the design. Three prototypes, the TSh-1,TSh-2 and TSh-3 were built. These aircraft were relatively good, but the weight of their armor caused a severe loss in overall performance, since they were basically under power for their weight.

In early 1936, Stain initiated the Ivanov project, a competition for a multi-purpose aircraft, which would be able to perform the assault, bombing, reconnaissance and escort roles. Five designs were submitted, the TxSB-27, the KhaL-5, the ANT-51, Ivanov-1 and the DG-58R, which was never completed because of the death of its designer. In the event, the Red Air Force chose the KhaL-5 and a total of 490 were built under the designation R-10.

Soviet air doctrine had, in sharp contrast to most European countries and the United States, rejected the idea that an independent air force could decide the outcome of a future war. As a result, Soviet designs were directed toward types that could assist the ground forces, including a class of dedicated ground attack aircraft.

On his own initiative, Ilyushin began to develop a so-called "Winged Tank." The outstanding feature of his design was an armored shell to protect the most vulnerable and vital parts of the aircraft; the crew, the engine, the fuel tanks and the oil system. This protective shell was to be an integral part of the airframe, not addition to it.

On 27 January 1938, Ilyushin submitted his proposal to Stain and assured him that a prototype would be ready for State Acceptance Trials in November. The proposal was accepted and Ilyushin was released from his other duties to be fully involved in the project. On 5 May 1938, an order was given for one prototype under the designation TxSB-55.

On 3 January 1939, the detailed project study for the TxSB-55 was submitted to the Commissariari of Defense Industry and on, 28 January 1939, a mock-to-use was finished. On 2 February 1939, the general layout-of the mock-up was accepted by the Red Air Force and an order was given to the Ilyushin Design Bureau to build two prototypes.

The armored shell of the TxSB-55 prototype was fabricated from AB-1 (_Astratiosmoon Agency_). An armor plate with high proportions of nickel and molybdenum, The shell, called _Bronekopas_, provided the "Nucleon" of the aircraft, with all other components being attached to it. It consisted of 4 to 50st plates around the power plant, its coolant and oil radioxitos, the fuel oil tanks, giving these components protection from below and the sides. The pilot and gunner were protected by 6mm to 8mm armor plates.

The wings, vital plane and what little of the forward leakage that was not formed by the armod shell, were of duration construction, with the rear fuselage and vertical stabilizer being made of wood. All fixed surfaces had light alloy skinning and, apart from the pneumatically-operated metal skinned flaps, all movable surfaces were fabricoured. The main undercating units had twin top-one-pneumation shock-shock absorber legs and retractured rearward, laying semi recessed in frairings under the wing center section. K-4 armor glass was used in the canopy.

The heavily armored assault aircraft needed a powerful engine. An air-cooled power plant would be ideally suited for this type of aircraft, because it was less vulnerable to ground fire than a liquid-cooled engine, but, at the time, there was no air-cooled engine with sufficient power available. The only engine available in the Soviet Union with sufficient power was the **The first TxSB-55 prototype during factory flight tests at Khodhodina airfield in late Autumn of 1939. At this time, the two best assault aircraft did not carry national markings.** The **rear gunner was equipped with a single ShKAS 7.62mm gun.** (Viltor Kulikov)
The rear gunner's position on the TsKB-ST prototype was occupied by a 41 gallon (155 meter) fuel tank which was separated from the cockpit by a 12nm armed buikhed and covered by a large dorsal spine. (Vildor Kulikov) AM-35, a 1,360 hp 12-cylinder, liquid-cooled, supercharged engine that drove a three-blade VHS-22T variable-pitch propeller. The prototype carried a total of 83.2 gallons (315 meters) of 59 octae fuel, distributed between tanks for one and at of the pilot's cockpit and beneath the pilot's feet.

Initially, it was planned to design both the oil cooler and radiator to be retractable, so that the cooling system could be protected. During the development of the TsKB-S5; however, this idea was dropped in favor of a more conventional layout.

Amanment consisted of four 7.628m SRMAS machine gms mounted in the outer wing panels and a similar weapon on a flexible mounting for the rear gunner. Four small, armed bomb busy were installed within the wing center section, each accommodating a single 220 ground (100 kg kg) bomb. These could be supplemented by two similar bombs on external wing tracks or replaced by a pair of externally-mounted 551 pound (250 kg) bombs.

The first prototype made is maladen flight with Vladimir K. Kokkinski at the controls on 2 October 1993. The second prototype flew for the first time on 30 December 1993, again with Vladimir K. Kokkinski at the controls.

The factory test program revealed some problems, mainly in the cooling system. The oil cooler and radiator tended to overheat at full power during a steep climb. As a result, the indicator was enlarged, displacing the oil cooler, which was relocated under the fuselage protected by an armored box. Further problems with the AM-35 power plant were solved during the facility.

The TsKB-S7 flew for the first time on 12 October 1940 with Vladimir K. Kokkinski at the controls. The TsKB-S7 was powered by an AM-38 engine which had better performance at low and medium altitudes than the earlier supercharged AM-35 engine. (Vildor Kulikov)

Despite the fact that the handling characteristics were considered to be poor and the aircraft's longitudinal stability was particularly bad, the second prototype was handed over to the Scientific Research Institute of the Red Air Force at Zhukovsky for the State Acceptance trials. During this evaluation, which lasted twenty days, a total of thirty-eight flights were conducted.

These tests revealed that the most serious problem was a relatively low speed (225 mph, 362 km/h) at ground level. This was a direct result of the fact that the supercharged AM-35 power plant, developed for high altitude missions, gave its best performance at 14,763 feet (4,500 meters). At low altitudes, where the TsKB-S5 would usually be flown, the supercharger absorbed a lot of power, giving the aircraft's no two speed. Other complaints included a short range, poor forward view, and weak density firepower.

But the Red Air Force had a good impression of the TsKB-S5 as a battlefield bomber and ordered ten pre-series aircraft for operational evaluation under field conditions. The military designation, SB-\(2\) (_Brainviewary Stornovic_ 2/Armored Assault Aircraft 2), was allocated to the TsKB-S5.

The first prototype was modified to overcome the problems detected during the State Acceptance trials. This aircraft was equipped with one of the two recently finished AM-38 power plants which deleted the supercharger. Longitudinal stability was improved by enlarging the stability by some 3.1 percent and by changing the center of gravity move to the front. This was done by installing the AM-38 engine 500at further forward. Two of the ShVAK 7.628m guts were replaced by two PTB-23 238m contours. The modification of the first prototype was nearly completed when an new order, issued by Kliment E. Voroshnikov, Commissar and Chairman of the Red Air Force (who felt that the rear gunner not necessary), came in to convert the TxKB-S5 to a single sent configuration. As a result, the first TsKB-S5 was never down before it was rebuilt to the single seat standard and the ten two seat BB-2 were never delivered.

Instead of a pure assault aircraft, Stalin and Voroshnikov preferred a single seat bomber, which could penetrate deeper into enemy territory at a higher altitude. Since there was no time to develop an entirely new aircraft, the liyushin decided to convert the first prototype, with the actual conversion taking less then a month. The rear gunner's position was now occupied by a 41 gallon (155 liter) fuel tank. The tank was separated from the cockpit by an 120at armed bubbland and covered by a large dorsal spine. The armament of four ShAsAs 7.62 ms pass was retained. The single seat bomber received the designation TsKB-S7 and flew for the first time on 12 October 1940. The factory test envelope lasted ten days and revealed that the TsKB-S7 and partly improved flight characteristics. The AT-38 applied sufficient power at low and medium altitudes and, during testing, the TsKB-S7 reached 262 mph (423 km/h) at ground level and 271.5 mph (437 km/h) at 9,186 feet (2,800 meters).

The preparations for production of the new type proceeded very slowly. In June of 1940, Ilyushin wrote a letter to the Central Committee of the All Unon Community Party and asked for permission to start production. But the Bureaucrats underestimated the importance of Ilyushin's design and did not even reply.

With the impressive results of the factory testing in hand, Ilyushin wrote to Stalin on 7 November 1940 and asked for immediate authorization to start production. After a December 1940 meeting at the Kremlin, production of the new type was finally authorized at GAZ 18 (GAZ, State Aircraft Factory) at Voronezh, even before the State Acceptance trials of the TsKB-S7 were fully completed.

## Single Seat II-2s

### TskB-55P

During early 1941, the Soviet leadership realized that it was only a matter of time before Germany launched an attack against the Soviet Union. As a result, the Eighteenth Party Conference, held in February of 1941, was devoted almost entirely to defense matters. The budget allocation for defense, during the period 1928 to 1933, had been 5.4 percent of the gross national product, but in 1941, with the threat of war, it did resen to 43.4 percent. The defense industry began working at a futrous pace and, by the time of Hitler's invasion, 2,839 were aircraft and 4,300 kinds had been built.

Immediately after the Commissariat of Aviation Industry gave the order, in December of 1940, to begin mass production of the new Ilyushin attack aircraft, the Ilyushin Design Bureau began to convert the second TskB-5 prototype to serve as a pattern asterix for the production type. All efforts of the Ilyushin Design Bureau were focused on the preparations for mass production of the new aircraft, which was going to be launched at GAZ 18 (GAZ _Gossdanthers Aransiere_).

The conversion work took into account the results of both the factory and State Acceptance Trials, which had revealed a number of problems with the TskB-57 prototype.

The AM-38 engine was installed 17580M lower and the canopy, including the pilot's seat was raised by 50km in order to improve the pilot's forward view over the nose. The rear gunner's position was deleted and replaced with the same type of fuel tank that had been installed on the TskB-57. Improved side arm was installed and the canopy was modified with armor glass replacing the standard glass.

This early production I-2 was destroyed by German SD-2 fragmentation bombs during the opening days of Operation BARBAROSSA. Pre-war production I-2s were equipped with a balance weight on the alleerton and had the ShKaS 7.622wa machine gun in the outbound position. (ECPA/DAA 1093 L16)

Initially, it was planned to arm the TskB-55P prototype with two PTB-23 23mM cannon and two ShKaS 7.622M machine guns in the wings, but the PTB-23 weapon had proved to be very unreliable during testing and further investigation revealed that the heavy recoil of the PTB-23 could damage the wing structure. As a result, the ShVAK 20mm cannon was installed in the TskB-55P. The prototype carried 420 20mm rounds and 500 7.62mft rounds for each weapon.

The ShKaS (**Sbitpathy-Komaritaki**s**) **Skyotrsterly/Sbitpathy-Komaritaki**s**) rapid fire machine gun was developed in 1930 especially for the Soviet Air Force and had rate of fire 1,800 rounds per minute. The weapon applied 200s (10 kg) and make velocity of 2,706 FPS (825 MPs). Large scale production of the ShKaS started in 1936.

The ShNaS (**Sbitpathy-Kolantiro Variations Aransiere (**Spipathy-Kolantiro**) or Large Caliper Caliper Caliper) was based of the highly successful 7.622M ShKaS. The 2004 common became available in 1936, weighted 92.5 pounds (42 kg) and had a rate of fire of 750 to 8000 red/mer minute. It had a overall length of 5.7 feet (1,7600km) with a bar-ter length of 4 feet (1,2450km).

On 29 December 1940 Vladimir K. Kokkai took off in the TskB-55P for the first and began the factory test program. The raised epsilon positionally improved the forward view and a number of aerodynamic refinements gave the aircraft better flying qualities than the original TskB-55-s January of 1941, the original military design of BSN-2/_Bronirovary Stornorny_ 2/Armored Assault Aircraft 2) was changed to 12. After a successful factory test program, the TskB-55P was handed over to the Scientific Research Institute of the Red Ari Force at Zhukovsky for State Acceptance Trials, which were flow byWhile the TskB-57 had a large air intake on top of the nose, the ll-2 had an air intake built into the fuseluge which was further at man on the TskB-57. An external pupil sight was mounted on top of the air intake on the prototype. This sight was replaced with PSP-1 (_Pridet App Recommendation S Fitzware_)[39]. Some late ll-2 single seat versions were also equipped with the slightly modified PSP-1A gunlight. The PSP-1 could be pushed to the instrument pump taking take off and landing and pulled out into its proper position when needed.

While the TskB-57 had six small exhaust shots, the ll-2 reconfigured the engine exhausts with five large exhaust shots (first five) and one smaller stub (last stub). A square access panel behind the exhausts on the TskB-55 and TskB-57 was replaced by a pump at a more triangular shape on production l-2. The l-2 was powered by a 1.600 ne pA-38 liquid cooled, l-2 cylinder Ve Ve power plant, which weighed 1.829 pounds (380 kg) and burned 95 cetaen fuel.

The windscreen was enlarged on the ll-2, with the three piece windscreen being made of 498km farmer glass. While the TskB-57 produced two large dorsal spine, the production l-2 featured a short glared car coveling to improve the rearward view for the pilot.

658km armed glass past was installed immediately behind the pilot's seat for rear protection. While the two side caugory frames on the prototype opened upwards, production l-2 had a single piece rear sliding energy with Skatm armor stop panels. The tail wheel and its housing were also slightly modified. The production l-2 had an air filter installed in the standard wing root. The landing lights, mounted on the saturated wing of the TskB-57 and TskB-57 prototypes, was deleted on production l-2, with the port landing light being retained. The pilot tube was moved to a more outward position and the later than passive on both wing tips were increased in size. While the TskB-57 and TskB-57 prototypes carried a single position light on each wing tip, production aircraft had two position lights, one on the upper surface of the wing and on the lower surface.

The prototype's armament, four ShKaS 7.62km guns, was replaced by two ShKaX 20mm cameras with 500 rounds per pan and two ShKaS 7.62km guns with 500 rounds per pan and two ShKaS 7.62km guns with 500 rounds per pan, with the first five.

The ShKaX proved to be rather unreliable in combat, many years, jamming with the front round rendering them useless for the rest of the mission.

This strip 12 was equipped with a ShKaX 20mm camon and has the 7.62km machine gun in the indoor wing position. This configuration was rarely seen on ShKaX equipped aircraft. The ShKaX had a shorter lateral than the V7a-23 camon. In addition, the aircraft has no electron mass balance weights. The system was armed with four Rs-2 rockets. (**Victor Kulway**)
**A Messerechmitt 91 109 of 4G s shot down this R-2 over the Northern Front. The main landing gear wheel was ripped off during the crash indoing. This R-2 carried an upper-surface camoufage of Black-Green and Medium Green over Light Blue undersurfaces. The national markings had a thin White outline. (Martin Villino)**

Production 12-s, produced at Voronck for the attack role, mounted eight Type RO rocket rails under the wings for RS-82 unguided air-to-ground rocks (four under each wing). When the full armament of eight RS-82 missiles was carried, the aircraft's top speed was decreased by about of (p=11 km). The RS-82 was adopted in 1937. The projectile was twenty-two inches (560MM) long, with a 1.28 bound (0.585 kg) warband and had a range of 3.23 miles (5,200 meters).

**This early-12-fall into Romanian army hands during the Winter of 1941/1942. It was fitted with four external reinforcing ribs on the fuselage (two low on the fuselage side and two high on the fuselage) as a field modification. These reinforcing ribs were necessary because the wooden rear fuselage could not withstand the stress of rough field operations and tended to break apart during hard landings. (Martin Kyburz)**

Due to Government pressure to begin mass production of the II-2, the workmanship of the first production aircraft was generally poor. This was also a result of insufficient training of the mainly unstilled workers used to build the II-2. Compared with the TxRB-55P prototype, which served as a pattern for the standard production versions, the II-2 had a higher empty weight and lower top speed, the latter was the result of the poor workmanship on the aircraft's skin, which was rnorued when the TxRB-55P prototype resulting in higher drag. A reduction of about 18.6 mB (Q3 km) in two speed on early production in-2s was recorded by the Central Aero and Hydrodynamics Institute during a wind tunnel evaluation of a Voronck built II-2.

I-2s produced before the war were camoufaged with Medium-Green uppressurfaces and Light Blue undersurfaces. There was a sharp line between the Green and the Blue camoufage on the fuselage and the wing. National markings were applied on the rear fuselage and the wing underestimates. The Red star had a thin Black outline and a single digital electrical number was applied on the fin. Most of the pre-war II-2s had the spiner in Medium Green, but some spinners were Black. Shortly after the beginning of the Great Patritic War, II-2s were camoufaged in a two time uppressurface camoufage of Medium Green and Black Green, with the undersurfaces in Light Blue. The demarcation between the upper and lower camoufage was soft edged. The Red star was applied on the wing undersurfaces, the rear fuselage and on the fin, and all had a thin White outline. The tactical number was applied to the rader or sometimes on the fuselage, or even in both positions. The serial number was applied either in White or Black on the fin. Some I-2s were required in the field and given Black fuselage undersurfaces, while the wings remained Light Blue. A few II-2s received a three time camoufage on the uppressurfaces of Medium Green, Black-Green and Earth Brown.

ing the rocket a lethal diameter of 656 feet (200 meters). The RS-132 could be carried on the RO rocket rails used with the earlier RS-32 rocket. A direct hit by either a RS-32 or RS-132 could knock out light and medium tails. But, because the rockes scattered in flight, they were used to attack right columns and amortheroop concentrations.

Late production I-2s had the PRP-1 or PRP-2s gain split replaced by a very rudimentary VV-1 gain sight. The VV-1 sight was introduced on single seat I-2s for the first time in August of 1942, just a few weeks before the production switched the two cost I-2M. The signal-to-gain light was proved to be very unpopulated with service plots because it had a tendency to cause serious head injuries in the event of a crash landing. As a result, it was replaced with the VV-1 timing device which consisted of three aiming circles drawn on the diamond shaped area of the amor glass windshield. The external front sight for the PRP-1 gain sight was retained and repositioned further to the rear. The VV-1 gain sight became the standard gun position not to test I-2M and the start two cost versions.

These late production I-2s called the four horizontal reinforcing ribs inside the falseest and some of the very late production single seat I-2s reduced the air filter to the fastward side side wide rotor. This small filter was fused to all I-2 two seat variants on the production line, but it was rarely seen on single seat I-2s. The sand filter became a vital modification when it became clear that the sand and dust on the upperoffields covered the AM-38 power plants. During the hot and dry Sumner of 1942, when the engines were faced with a partially high amounts of dust, no less then 250 engine failures were reported by front-line Assault Aviation Regiments.

Production of single seat I-2s continued until the late Summer 1942, when the I-2M replaced the single seaters on the assembly lines.

**These I-2s are on the assembly line at the vast assembly buildings of State Aircraft Factory 18. These I-2s were painted in the factory with a Black-Green and Medium Green uppressurface camouriage. No national markings were carried on the wing upper-surface. The Red Star was carried on the fuelestage, finrouder and wing undersurfaces. These were painted at the factory with a thin white outline. (G. F. Petrov)**

## II-2 Two Seat Conversions

The most serious problem with the I-2 was is lack of the rear protection. German fighter pilots quickly learned that the aircraft could be easily dounted by an attack from the rear and this quickly became the standard knife for attacking I-2s. The May 1940 decision to remove the rear gun position from the TKRB-55 in favor of additional fuel and range, led to serious losses, but proved that Ilyushir's original two seat configuration was the best configuration for an assault aircraft. Enflies complaints about the alarming attrition rate were sent from front-line regressors in the Ilyushir Design Bureau. In their battle periods, I-2 plots biberty complained about the complete lack of rear defense.

Some reipens: however, did not wait for an answer from the Design Bureau and added a rear gun position as a field modification. In the 198th Assual Aviation Regiment, the Regiment engineering officer calculated that the change in the center of gravity was acceptable. He then cut a semi-explicor hole in the rear of the canopy and improvised a gunner's position, armed with a 7.62km machine gun. The rear gunner out the ammunition box and holes were also cut in the improvised seat for the aircraft's control rods.

Other Regiments, such as the 57th Assual Aviation Regiment, cut off the rear portion of the canopy and a part of the fuselge in order to make room for the rear gunner, 7.62km machine gun and ammunition. The Saks 7.62km weapon was chosen because it was available in large numbers. Often the turchet ring was a modified unit taken from a Polikarpov R-5 bibane.

The 17th Air Army, under the command of Lieutenant General S.A. Krasovsky was assigned to the Southwestern front, and was completed of the 208th and 637th Assual Civil. Divisions. The units covered sixty-six I-2s into the two-seat configuration during the Antum of 1942. The 17th Air Army saw heavy combat on the Sulignard front, supporting the Soviet counterflowers to encircle the German 6th Army under the command of General Friedrich Funds.

The 23rd Assual Aviation Division introduced their rear gun I-2s into combat a ssoen the unit became active in the Northwestern front in June of 1942. Colonel I. Davidov of the 23rd Assual Air Division, together with his engineering officer, Y. Kobilikov, demonstrated.

This I-2 of the 57th Ship **23** (Assual Aviation Regiment) was modified with a rear gun position. The flexible Saks 7.62km gun was used with ammunition belts from boxes which also served as a seat for the rear gunner. (G.F. Peterson)

In the late Summer of 1941 the following units were committed to combat: the 61st, 65th, 74th, 215th, 243th and 502nd Assual Aviation Reghement. The 61st Assual Aviation Regiment received their operation free in 31 July 1941 in the Smokera. A flight of the 74th Assual Aviation Regiment, led by Lieutenant G. M. Moshiner, was able to destroy fifteen enemy tanks and vehicles advancing toward Moscow on 5 October. During October, the 74th Assual Aviation Regiment further lose 700 missions, destroying fifty-five trucks, twenty half-tracks and a number of vehicles, for the loss of only nineteen l-2s.

All the beginning of the war, an Assual Aviation Regiment consisted of two quadrants with nine l-2s on strength with an additional two l-2s allocated to the Regiment's command flight. In reality, due to poor maintenance and a lack of spare parts, no more than ten to fifteen l-2s per experiment were operational at any given time during the early stages of the war.

As soon the State Aircraft Factory began delivering a steady flow of aircraft during the Spring of 1942, the Assual Aviation Reghement were expanded to three quadrants of ten aircraft along with two for the Regiment's command.

The l-2s was on the most unpleasant surprises the German Wehrmann had to face during its advance into the Soviet Union. In fact, the l-2 was the only effective weapon in the inventory of the Red Air Force which could deal with mirror. The l-2 had escaped German intelligence until the type appeared for the first time over the battlefield. The tight security measures of the Sulin administration in defense matters and a certain disinterest in new Soviet aircraft developments in the German intelligence services were generally responsible for this

The 12 captured by Hungarian troops was regulated in Royal Hungarian Air Force markings. The thus only partially marked having a single white band rather than the Reading-Green hands normally carried on Hungarian aircraft. (Goorge Puruk)

228th Annual Aviation Division attacked several airfields on the southwestern front and destroyed not less than sixty German aircraft on the ground.

11-2 losses were very heavy and the attrition rate continued to climb as more Assault Aviation Engineers were highly formed. Many 12-pixels lacked sufficient flight matching on the type when they were assigned to a Regiment and ordered combat. It was most common to train these pilots for run hours on the Lisimov L2- transport plane before they were sent into combat in the 12-2. Most of these pilots were only familiar with the most simplified tactics and attacked their targets in a shallow dive, which made the aircraft a steady target for concentrated ground for. During this stage of the Great Purotic WA, a 12 pilot was awarded the "floor of the Soviet Union" model after ten successful missions, but very few pilots achieved this goal. In the second half of the war, 100 combat missions had to be thrown to earn the award.

This 12 crash landed in friendly territory on the Eastern Front during 1942. It was unusual in that I carried a three tone supersurface camouflage of Medium Green, Black-Green and Earth Brown. Three tone camouflage schemes were rarely used on single seat I2-2s. (Zotzek Iruf)The II-2I (I = _Istrebelt_ or _Fighter_) was developed by the Ilyushin Design Bureau after assault II-2S scored several below downs of slow lying Larkwater trauspars and bombers, such as HeIIRED-11-s or Junkers Jo-52s, used on the Eastern front to fly supply missions for the various German pockets, which were surrounded by the advancing Red Army. With its defeating frequency of two 230km common and two 7.62km machine guns, German transports were an easy prey for II-2s.

In-2s of the 288th Assen Aviation Regiment engaged and slow down a number of German Jurks Jo-52s during the Winter of 1942 when the Larkwater started to supply the excited 100,000 soldiers of 2nd Army Corps who were trapped by the Soviet winter offensive in the Dreams pocket.

In May 1943, the Ilyushin Design Bureau submitted a proposal to the Red Air Force for a single set fighter based on the I-2, but with an updated AM-38F engine. Armed with two 7V-23 antennas, the fighter version of the Stornqvist had more for power than fighters currently in use with the Red Air Force. It was planned to operate the fighter variant in low and medium altitudes against transports, Sukas and bombers, as the left-111.

As soon as the proposal was accepted by state authorities, the Ilyushin Design Bureau begun to convert a single set II-2 to the fighter configuration. The two SikAs 7.62km guns were removed, as well the eight eight juge KP on Larkwater rats. The alierown has balance weights were also deleted. The aircraft returned to equality to carry two external underving north packs, each stressed to carry up to 1,102 pounds (500 kg). Gun arm consistent of a pair of V7-23 amons with an ammonia supply of 150 rounds per gun. A V-V-1 gun sight was mounted on the air intake scoop.

To handle increased stress, the wooden wing was reinforced. The aircraft was powered by a 1,700 bp AM-38F engine. The I-2I weighed 11,867 pounds (53,38 kg), which was 882

## II-2M-82/II-4

The German invasion of the Soviet Union advanced through Smolensky to the Western edge of Moscow, laid sieep to Leningrad, and captured Kiev and much of the Ukraine. The fall of Smolensky to the Germans on 16 July 1941 placed Moscow in incumbent danger.

At 0530 on 30 September 1941 the Germans launched _Lurenthenten Tafilm_ (Operation TYPHOON), when _General/fat/mat/smolensky_ Fedor von Book's Army Group Center planned a double envelopment of Soviet troops granting the approaches of Moscow.

With the impending attack, the evacuation of Moscow's factories, producing vital war goods, became critical. With the movement of the Mikulin engine work (GAZ-24) from Moscow to a location behind the UIZ mountains, a shortage of AM-38 power plants was expected.

As a result, the Iyushin Design Burena started a project to adapt alternative engines to the II-2. When the Wehrmatch penetrated towards Moscow, a high priority was assigned to the project.

A pre-war standard production single seat II-2 served as an engine test bed. One of the power plants chosen for installation was the M-82 fomen cylinder two row radial engine which was, at that time the only reliable engine which could serve as a substitute for the AM-38 if a shortage of engines occurred.

The testbed was designated the II-2M-82, which was subsequently changed into II-4. The I,676 Mb M-82 engine was developed by Arcadly D. Shevroev and his team in their Design Bureau at Fermi in central Russia. Shortly after the end of the State Acceptance Trials, large scale production of the M-82 power plant was started in May of 1941. Due to the fact that Peru was in Shevrova, it was far beyond the range of German bombers and therefore there was

**The II-4 was powered by a Skutosov 1,676 Mb M-82 air-cooled radial engine. It was converted from a pre-war production I-2 single seater and retained the silicon mass balance weights. The national markings on the rear fuselage had a thin small Black outline. (Vibtor Kuhlov)**

to change of shortages.

To match the II-2 airframe with the bulky M-82 radial engine was not an easy task. It was necessary to separate the armored cantilever engine shell from the firewall immediately ahead of the wing leading edge. The M-82 engine mounting was unarmed and was fitted with a NACA type cowling with airflow regulating flag at the trailing edge. In order to retain the aircraft's thrust line, the engine was mounted lower, giving the I-2M-82 a humpedosed appearance.

The spinwer was more conical and the VISH-22T propeller was replaced by an AV-5-160 propeller. A large at intake duct was installed in the top of the engine working and there was a single exhaust second mounted on each side of the cowling just below the coil flops. On the surround side, the AM-38 wing root air intake was fixed over.

Offensive ammanent remained the same as on the early reduction I-2, two 20mM SUVAR common and a two Sukkas 7.6204 guns in the wings and undernova rocket aliki; however, the external front sight for the PBP-IIB gain switch was deleted.

The lighter engine and the removal of the engine cooling system, together with the simpler construction, led to a weight reduction of 820 pounds (400 kB). The two set II-4 had a weight of 12,908 pounds (5,855 kg), some 293 pounds (133 kg) less than the AM-38 powered single seat II-2.

The rear guner's station was reinstated although the position was somewhat further back and fitted with protective armor for the rear guner. In addition, the two side windows of the front canopy were slightly enlarged when compared with the production single seat II-2. The Berezin UBT (UB = _Universalij Berezin_ while the T stands for a turret version) 12.7mm machine gun was surrounded by a glared covering and, as a result, the angle of five was limited to 38 degrees upward and to 22 degrees to either side. An ammunition supply of 280rounds was provided. The UBT entered the Red Air Force inventory during 1940. It weighed 56 pounds (25.5 kg). had a length of 4.46 feet (1,365nm0), had a rate of fire of 800 rpm and a muzzle velocity of 2,821 feet per second (860 meters per second). This highly successful weapon was used on the P-2, T-v2 and P-8 homes.

The introduction of a Far parameter had 1 necessary to relocate the fuel tank to a position under the pilot. The fuel capacity was also increased to 191 galloms (724 liters). The antenna must moved from the fusage to the top of the enlarged energy frame.

The 1-D prototype was painted in Medium Green on the upwardsurfaces over Light Blue undersurfaces. The national marking serves carried on the rear fusage and the wing undersurfaces with an Black routine. No tactical or special markings were carried on the B1-4,

The I-4 fle fle for the first time on 8 September 1941, with Vladimir K. Kokkinski at the controls. During factory testing, the 11-n4 reached a speed of 237 mB (382 nmu) at ground level and 261 mph (421 kmu) at 8,530 mC (1600 degrees). The test was placed also revealed some center of gravity problems and poor longitudinal stability. The lighter engine, reduced arm and rear gun position had resulted in a rearward shift of the center of gravity. Even with these problems the tests went forward and were completed in eight days.

Due to the evacuation of the Division Design Bureau and the chaston that occurred when the German were moved. The system has been successfully delayed and did not start before late February of 1942.

The performance of the B1-4 was rated as slightly inferior to that of the B1-2, but the I-4 was attributed by the Commissariat of Aviation Industry for production after the successful State Acceptance Trials, which ended in April of 1942. When it became clear that there would be no significant shortage of A4-N8 engines; however, it was decided not to produce the I-4 and as a result the I-4 prototype remained the only example built.

When it became clear that the radial engine Stormwork project had been canceled, the design function I-4 was allocated to the twin engined long range Division DB-3F bomber, which was used by the Long Range Bomber Regiments. The M-82 engine became a success of its own, with over 700,000 engines being built. They were used to power the Lavellix La-5 and La-7, as well the Toujero Tv2 - bomber.

The B1-82-820-4 prototype is up on jacks for drop tests of its main landing gear on 16 September 1941. The B1-4 engine drove a three blade A/V-460 propeller. The starboard wing root air intake was deleted on the I-4. (Vilot Kulikov)

## II-2M

The most serious shortcoming of the single seat II-2 was its total lack rear defense. Lathwaffe pilots quickly discovered this weakness and developed tactics to attack the I-2 in its most vulnerable position - the high rear quarter. Without fighter except, the attrition rate in a Assult Aviation Registers was very high.

Plots bitterly complained to the Division Design Bureau about this tactical weakness and the disadvantage it put them in. It was ironic that Iyushin had designed the original I-2 with a rear gunter position. The dramatic count loses suffered by the Assult Aviation Registers and the declining combat effectiveness of the I-2 prompted a special conference at the Kermelin in early 1942 to consider measures to alleviate attrition and improve the combat capability of the I-2. Both temporary measures and long term solutions were discussed.

The conference was attended by led Satin, the Commissar of Aviation Industry Alesei Shastriam and his deputy Aleksand Yakovlev, as well as a number of service pilots, test pilots and design personnel. They acquired a number of conditions, most of which were to be rapidly promulgated, the most fundamental being that the I-2 must have provisions of a rear defensive position. This was now considered vital and Satin described that the conversion of the single seat version to the two seat variant should be accomplished in the shortest possible time, but without any interruption of I-2 production.

During the Spring of 1942, the Iyushin Design Bureau developed two variants of a two seat II-2. The first variant was equipped with a MV-3uret containing a Berezin UBT 12.7Mon machine gun. Flight tests quickly revealed that the weight of the turret considerable reduced the aircraft's overall performance and, due to the fact that the turret shifted the center of gravity to the rear, the flight characteristics also were adversely affected and now were considered as unacceptable for a combat pilot with worse flight skills.

The second variant was a nearly direct copy of the I-2M-82 rear gun configuration. The cockpit was extended further back, with protective armor for the rear gunter added to both sides of the breakage, so that the gunter is an amured "bathtub". In addition, the two sides windows of the front canopy were slightly enlarged. In addition to the Berezin UBT 12.7Mon

**This experiment--I-2M had the cockpit armor capable extended to the rear to make near gunters position. The fuselage but tank was deleted and replaced by two wing tanks mounted in the underwering bomb bayes. This conversion was not cleared for production. (Viltor Kulikov)**

## Fuselage Development

In March of 1942, the Iyushin OKB converted a standard production I-2 single seat aircraft into a two seat configuration, making only minimal changes to the aircraft's structure.

First, a monitoring for a Berezin UBT 12.7Mon machine gun was installed on the amor plate that separated the fuel tank from the cockpit. The near glanced canopy of the single seat II-2 was cut off to make room for the rear gunter compartment. As a result, the rear gun position was very small, clamped and primitive. The gunter was seated on a padded canvas seat suspended from either side of the cockpit. This was protected against fire from the rear hemisphere by a GAM armed bulbhead in the rear fuselage.

When compared with the single seat II-2, the gross weight on the I-2M was raised by some 2,094 pounds (950 kg). This figure included the UBT gun, amminution, additional armor protection and the gunter. Most of the weight was placed just behind the center of gravity and,as a result, the aircraft's stability was marginal and the handling characteristics were barely acceptable.

Regardless of these serious problems, the ll-2M passed State Acceptance Trials in the late Summer of 1942 and then the new type was immediately cleared for production by the Commissariat of Aviation Industry in September of 1942.

Other changes in the ll-2M included replacement of the long radio mast of the ll-2 with a small mast fitted on the rear energy framing. In order to reduce weight, the ll-2M carried two instead of four underlying rocket trails. The aircraft took sight of the PNP-1 gun sight, carried on top of the fir it intake, was replaced by an external factor sight for the V-1 gun sight which was mounted further the rear. The rudimentary V-1 gun sight consisted of three aiming circles in the "diamond shaped" mirror glass windscreen.

The alternate shouse weights were defined on two exit versions and the same filter fitted a number of simple steel I-2s was standard on the ll-2M and subsequent variants. Some features, introduced on all two scatters, were also incorporated on a number of late production single sasters and are not totally unique to the ll-2M.

After thirty ll-2Ms were built, the side arme protection for the pilot and, especially for the guner, was improved, although externally this modifications could not be detected. Even with this change, the arme protection of the rear guner remained inadequate during the entire production life of the ll-2. Since the series production ll-2 had been originally designed as a single seater, it was impossible to enlarge the armed capsule further so that the guner could also enjoyed the benefit of sufficient arme protection. This was due to the fact that such redesign work could not easily be absorbed into the production line without interruping

This early production II-2 was captured by the Luftwaffe and repainted with German markings including the Yellow identification bands carried by Luftwaffe aircraft operating on the Eastern Front.

This II-2, Yellow 3, was modified in the field with external stiffeners on the rear fuselage.

The inscription reads "For Otradnov" and refers to a fellow pilot killed in combat.

The aircraft was camouflaged Black-Green and Olive Drab with a Red arrow on the luesuesing. (G.F. Petrov)

## II-2 Type 3

Throughout its production life, Stormwork pilots complained that the I-2 was a staghigh and unresponsive aircraft with poor stability. The last problem had been compounded with the introduction of the interim I-2M two seater, Suliars's diective forbude introduction of any modifications that were likely to disrupt deliveries of I-2s to the front and, as a result, flyush could do little more than make small changes, but the dangerous stability problems of the I-2M demodulated particular attention. This problem resulted in the introduction of the I-2P type. This was considered the definitive two-seater and was to become numerically the most important variant of the basic design.

Partly as revisit of wind tunnel research of the Central Aero and Hydrodynamics Institute at Zharkovsky, the outer wing panels of the I-2 were given a 15 degree sweep back which transfers leftward, compromising for the rear shift of the center of gravity, which had accentribed the I-2's worst characteristics.

The State Acceptance Trials of the I-2 Type 3 were completed on 12 December 1942, and the new swept back wing was quickly put into production, replacing the original wing.

Apart from the new wing, the I-2 Type 3 is leaving the assembly lines during the 1942 and early 1943 were identical to late production I-2-As. As quickly as they come off the assembly late. The 25 time 3 were used without the continuing stage.

While the first production batches of I-2 Type 3s were equipped with the standard I,600 bp M-43 power plant, aircraft produced from January 1943 outward were modified with the I,700 bp M-43 SWP board plant (the suffix "F" in the engine designation stood for _Fenvironn_ for oboched). The AM-38F ran at a lower compression ratio than the AM-38 (from 70 \(\pm\) 0.60), and a result, the engine could burn low-octane feel, like that used for military trucks. The additional power improved the overall performance of the I-2 Type 3. Naturally there was no difference between the cowling of the AM-38 and AM-38F powered aircraft.

Wind tunnel research by the Central Aero and Hydrodynamics Institute at Zharkovsky was performed on this pre-production-2 (1-2 Type 3. As a result, a 15 degree sweep back was added to the outer wing panels, transferring its reward and compensating for the at movement of the center of gravity. (Q.F. Petrov)

During the production life of the I-2 Type 3, a number of modifications were introduced to the basic airframe. The starboard plot tube was moved from a position near the VYA-23 23stmon to position close to the wing tip late production I-2 Type 3s.

The early I-2 Type 3 had two wind where rocket skinal identical to those used on the I-2M. These ruls were attached by two months to the wing. Later I-2 Type 3s were modified with a new rocket rail which had a faring covering the rail.

The rear canopy for the planner was also modified. The first I-2 Type 3 had the same canopy as the late production I-2M. Later I-2 Type 3s had a semi-circular rear canopy section which was introduced during the Spring of 1943 (some I-2 Type 3s were seen with this section removed as a field modification). For a short period, these I-2 Type 3s occurred to the small radio mass fitted on the rear of the canopy frame, but most late production I-2 Type 3s were modified with a long antenna mast mounted in the same location (some late aircraft had the antennas moved to a position on the pilots campey framing). Late production I-2

State tests were performed on an engeniess I-2 Type 3 at the Central Aero and Hydrodynamics Institute at Zharkovsky. The hole in the starboard wing root is where the sand air filter would normally be located. (G.F. Petrov)

indicator. There were lamps mounted in the front cockpit to allow the pilot to read maps during hours of darkness.

During the Great Participic War, a number of new weapons were introduced. One of the most successful was the PTAB hollow charge anti-tank bomb. This weapon weighed 2.5 pounds and 192 of them could be housed in a KMB Ganister. One KMB carrier could be carried in each of the four bomb ways in the wing. Tests, with this weapon, proved so successful that Colonel General Boris L. Vanikov, the People's Commissator for Amramment, ordered that 8,000 units be produced by 15 May 1943.

The PTAB was used for the first time on a large scale during the Battle of Kursk in the Ojol - Kursk sector in July of 1943. The new weapon proved to be extremely successful, with the bombs penetrating up to 70stof error. When the tank's gasoline tanks were ignited, the shock wave, from the resulting explosion, and fragments of armor hit the crew and ammunition, which usually exploded.

On 2 July 1943 a group of eight IB-2 Type 3s of the 50th Assault Aviation Regiment of the 1st Guards Assault Aviation Division), assigned to the 8th Air Army under the command of Hero of the Soviet Union, Captain M.I. Smirskiy attacked an concentration of about every German tanks poised for a counterattack. The IB-2 smoke five runs, dropping no less than 1,232 PTAB hollow charge anti-tank bombs. They get fifteen enemy vehicles after.

On 5 July 1943, IB-2 of the 291st Asault Aviation Division of the 16th Air Army, under the command of Colonel A. Virink, claimed the destruction of thirty tanks with these bombs near Vornecha. Usually, PTAB hollow charge anti-tank bombs were released from a altitude of 230-330 feet (70 meters in 100 meters) above the battlefield and covered an area about 50 feet (15 meters) wide and 236 feet (70 meters) long. During the battle of Kursk, the 16th Air Army, under the command of Colonel General S.I. Rudenko, flew no less than 56,350 combat stories, the most flown by I-2s.

During 1942, the improved RBS-82 and RBS-132 rockets were introduced into service. These were developed from the earlier RS-82 and the RS-132 rockets. These were equipped with an armor piercing warhead and a more powerful rocket engine for use against tanks and armored vehicles.

One method, used to discourage the fighter attacks from the blind spot behind the tail was the installation of a DAG-10 greade luncher in the rear fuselage. The luncher held ten

gremades and could be operated by either the pilot or winner. The greades were attached to small parcathues which opened automatically. They were set with a three-second fuses so that they exploited about 328 feet (100 meters) to the rear of the aircraft and in the path of the ocean parsing figures.

Reduced losses were also achieved by a change of tactics. Enroute to a target area, Stomorowski was finally drawn at very few altitudes in a "V" or chédenotation function which ensured the greatest volume of defensive fire. For repairing fighter attacks over enemy occupied territory, the formation returned into a "circle." The erows covering one another with their common and machine guns.

Papavie, revealed that for the second half of the Great Patriotic War, when the 3rd Air Army port in the Berolasman campaign and later struck into East Prasasis, fifty percent of the i@-2s returned from a mission with some battle, only 28 percent of the Stromok were actually lost. Six percent of the cripled i@-2s had to make erased landings, but some injury percent of the damaged i@-2s could be required at the front with the help of specialising assigned to each Assault Aviation Regiment. Only ten percent had to be shipped back to Repair Depots in the rear or had to be scrapped.

The average number of missions performed by i@-2s during the entire Great Patriotic War was thirty sorting before the aircraft was lost. In the early stage of the war, this figure was dramatically lower. For more than half of the war, the i@-2 pilots could not count or fighter errors; however, the situation became better in the final months of the war, when enough fighter Aviation Regimes were available to protect the i@-2s from enemy fighters. One third of all am since we received the country's highest award, the Hero of the Soviet Union, were Stomorowski crews.

A meeting of a Yugoslav delegation with San oil 00 February 1949 ended with to constructive agreements resulted in the definitive break in a Yugoslav - Soviet relations.

As a result, Air Force established a number of measures in order to keep the Il2- Type 3 cross section fleet flying, since they now cut off from spare parts from the Soviet Union. The Zememinky flax factory built 300 metal fusetages to replace the original wooden fusetages of the Il2-Type 3s built during the war. About a dozen Il2-Type 3s are also converted to two at N-21-Tyrs transfers.

A number of Il2-Type 3 were required with a Black cameddine finish sprayed over their original part and were set by eight operating during 1949. Finally, in 1955 all remaining 12-Type 3s and h-21-Tyrs were withdrawn from operational service.

Czechoslovakia

On 24 September 1944 the first contingent of Czech airmen began conversion training in the h-2 Type 3 as part of the 41st Advanced Training Aviation Regiment based at Prazenyl air-field in Poland.

The training was so intensive and well organized that already on 15 October 1944, a group of the first 2- Czech crew were selected to support the Slovakia insurger process at Trien July (Three Ozaks), lying between Zyclen and Bangaks Bystrica. The insurger may which numbered about 50,000 soldiers was commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Jan Gofain. The all listed Slovakia insurger uptrigin: however, was suppressed by the Germans in late October 1944, before the Czech pilots could get into action and the Czech 12- mission was canceled by the 2nd Air Army under the command of Major General S.A.Kroszynski.

The training process proceed relatively slowly, due to unfavorable weather, a temporary lack of aircraft and the unequal training levels of the Slovak pilots. The less experienced of them found it difficult to make the transition from obsolete biplanes to the Il2- and this result in a number of accidents.

The ltt Czechoslovakia Independent Combined Air Division was officially formed on 25

January 1945, being subordinate to Lieutenant General N.V. Zhdanov, commander of the Soviet Sht Air Army. Over seventy percent of the unit were Slovak airmen. The 3rd Czechoslovakia Bertinent, as part of the Czechoslov Independent Combined Air Division, was equipped with thirty-four I.2-Type 30, some of which were late production variants with all metal wings and rear fusetages.

In the following weeks, the training of Czech pilots and gunners nearly came to a standstill, nevertheless the program continued or Prazenyl, very slowly and sometimes interrupted by crashes and landing accidents. Between 20 February and 5 March 1945, the 3rd Czechoslov Baltic Regiment was based at lovenic airfield for further training. The unit was considered to be combat ready on 23 March 1945. But before the Regiment moved into combat, additional weapons within 88.8-28-orders and bonus was conducted.

Between 21 April 1945, the 3rd Czechoska Beatine Bolem weight its thirty-three II-2 Type 3s and h-21-Tyrs moved to a new base near Katuquee in liberated Poland. After a short time it was discovered that the grass many was too soft for the Il2-S and the unit moved to Pream airfield, only twelve miles (twenty kilometers) from the front lines.

On 14 April 1945, the unit five lifts from combat mission was a group of eight l2-Type 3s, executed by three Czech flowla L-S/Fiberis, block off to detect artillery positions and tank concentrations near the village of Oltaa. This mission was part of a Red Army offensive to drive the Germans from the heavily industrialized area of Oltaa's in Czechlovakia. The same target was attacked later the same day, but during take-of two I-2s collided leaving only seven to proceed to the target.

A day later missions were brought against troop concentrations at Dolini Beneshov and Beha. He-2 Type 3 also hit the railway station at Smokov on 16 April, but the formation run into very heavy anti-interned defenses and more than twenty were damaged. Later that only three unit attacked two bridges over the Oder river.

On 16 April 1945, during an attack on the Oder bridges, rear number Pligh Sergearan Richard Mannman, a former member of No 311 Squadron, Royal Air Force, both a Form 59 100 near Oltaa; however, his Minorik was damaged and baved made it home.

During the first days of operations no losses were recorded, but a number of Sornovovski sustained heavy damage, leaving twenty-three aircraft fully operational. On 19 April 1945 the unit fleve seven missions against troop concentrations around Zaleklow, Kopryot and Novoy Bohumin. During one such draft, the first Czech Il2 (Olow by Warman Officer P. Stationy and Corporal J. Bilka) was reported as missing in action. On 20 April, the unit returned to Zaleklow, Kopryotov and Novoy Bohumin, in addition to flying two reconnaissance flights.

and destroyed one enemy fighter, forty-five trucks, twenty-two other vehicles, one locomotive, thirty-seven seasons and two fault crashes. They also destroyed one antimuthogenic table, two multimits stocks, three buildings and sixty-eight anti-sircraft positions. Eight I2-Type 3s were lost during operations in the Ontario area. Four were lost to enemy action while the other four were written off in non-commercial accidents and crashes.

On 10 May 1945, the and Czechowak Battle Regiment was transferred to Albrechickly near Privor in Morais. Between 14 and 22 May 1945 the unit was based at Prague-Kebly. On 20 July, the remaining twenty-five I2-Type 3s and the two I2-Tyne were officially transferred from the Red Air Force to the Czechowak Ministry of Defense and the unit was later renumbered the Sobt Attack Regiment and based at Tremsen-Biklovic.

**Bulgaria**

In 1941, Bulgaria, a largely agricultural country with a constitutional monarchy under Zsar Boris III, found itself allied with Nazi Germany. On 12 December 1942, Bulgaria declared war to the United States and England, but remained in its dealing with the Soviet Union. On 8 September 1944, the Red Army invaded Bulgaria and a day later a Moscow suppression government, under Ministerie Goregler came to power, declaring war on Germany.

In early 1945, a Soviet Technical Commission arrived in Bulgaria to modernize the Bulgarian Air Force, which was at that time, with the exception of the Messechmitt BH 109, a rather obsolete force.

On 14 March 1945, an agreement was signed to rebuild the Bulgarian Air Force under Soviet responsibility. As part of the military assistance program, injury-six I2-Type 3s and three I2-Turant waves delivered in April of 1945, these were followed later by an additional seven I2-TUTs. These aircraft were all based at Provivivi airfield.

When the wooden fuselose of the I2-shaped and the first signs of corrosion they were replaced by all metal redesions, built by the Zernucky Herz factory in Yugoslav. Some 100 all-metal fuseloseys were obtained in exchange for Bulgarian Air Force Messerschmitt BH 109G-6a, which were turned over to the Yugoslav Air Force as payment.

The Bulgarian II-2 Type 3s were used mainly in the Assult Aviation Regiment, but a number were also used as flying observation posts for spotting artillery fire. The last example of the I1-2 Type 3 was phased out, along with the I1-10, in the Spring of 1958.

## II-2 Type 3M

During late 1991, Hyushin started first work to re-arm the I1-2 with large caliber cannons. While the VY=23 25km cannot cool penetrate enemy armor, its warhead was not large enough to inflict heavy damage to armorved vehicles equipped with thick armor plate.

As part of the test program, a single set II-1 had its VY=23 camon replaced by a Sh-37 37nm carbon mounted in a goodaba under each wing. The two wing mounted machine guns were retrained. The goodaba housed the gun and its aluminium supply (forty rounds) since it was technically impossible to install the heavy weapon and the ammunition supply in the wing itself as it was one case with the VY=23-23.

The flying characteristics of the I1-2 with the under wing common suffered, due to a shift in the center of gravity. Fitting tests also revealed that the gun had a strong recoil forces, which could damage the goodaba mounting. As a result of these tests, this prototype was the only 21% of the Sh-37 cmannannann was installed in a production I2-Type 3 under the I1-Type 30 mrad.

In March 1994, the NS-37 37nm canonna installed in a production I2-Type 3 under the I1-Type 30 mrad. The NS-37 had entered service during 1942. It weighed 330 pounds (150 kg) and had a rate of five of 250 pounds per minute. The NS-37 could penetrate armor up to 4840 km thick.

Like the earlier Sh-37, the NS-37 was housed in a under wing goods together with its annihilation supply (50 rounds). Fully loaded, the goodaba weighed 522 pounds (237 kg) and, as a measure to reduce the air current's overall weight, the four underlying rocker trails were deleted and the maximum bomb load, which could be carried in the undeforming bomb bys, was reduced 4040 pounds (200 kg). The VY=23 camons were detected, while the 7.62km machine guns were retrained for rating purposes. The all wheel was for tubes (10 cm) higher and the tail wheel faring was also enlarged.

Figure tests, which listed between the March and April of 1994, reveal that, when the air-wall was fully armed, the center of gravity had shifted by 3.5 percent to the rear. As a result, the I1-2 Type 3M required considerably plinging skill and had much more demanding flight characteristics.

Figure trials with the I1-2 Type 3M revealed that the recoil of the NS-37 camon damaged the goodaba mounting, and as a result, recoil dampers were incorporated in the goodaba.

The I1-2 Type 3M went into action during the battle of Kurush in July of 1994, where the Germans had assembled some 2,700 tanks and self-propelled guns for Operation CITADEL, the Germansformer offensive against the Red Army. The NS-37 quickly proved that it could knock out Panter and Tiger trails on the Kurush battlefield.

The I1-2 Type 3M prototype was armed with a Sh-37 37nm cannot mounted in an under-wing goods. The goodaba housed the gun and forty rounds of ammunition. (G. F. Petroy)

 propeller. The large sand-finder installed in the standard wing root of the l2-2M and l2-2 Type 3-a was relocated under the wing center section on the l1-10.

The offensive armament of the production l1-10 remained the same as the prototypes, although a s-13 given camera was added in a fairing on the starboard wing. The common barrel flaring of the YY2-32 common was modified with an additional blister shove around the l1-10. The near armament consisted of a UBK 12.7ab grain with 150 rounds mounted in a VUL-18 meter. The water U-V beam at a field of fine of 50 degrees elevation, 18 degrees depression and 45 degrees in azimuth.

While the l2-2 Type 3 was equipped with four bomb hys in the wing, the l1-10 had only two hys, located just inbound of the landing gear wheel well. The l1-10 also had two externally Type 3-a20m rack for bombos to 551 Pound (520 Kb). The l2-Type 3 was equipped with four rocket exit, l1-10s produced during the war deleted the rils, although there were provisions for mounting the rils within the wings; however, due to their poor accuracy, rocksets were usually used on l1-10s.

The main uncertainty members proved on the forward spur of the two-spar wing to turn through 90 degrees and the far in the wing. The main wheel farings and the main uncertainty degree were also consideredly reduced in size.

The landing gear, wing, Plaps, Pakes and starter, were all pneumatic and there were two-pressure air cylinders for normal operations and one high pressure cylinder for emergency operations. When the AM-42 engine was running, a Type AK-50 direct-drive air compressor maintained pressure in the system. Late reduction l1-10s had a 7-K5 compressor.

The access hdrness for the armament were changed in layout to order to obtain easier maintenance and rearming in the field. While the l2-Type 3 had rounded wing tips, the l1-10 had blatter wing tips. The position left on each winging was repositioned to the inner rear of the wing.

There were two air intakes in the wing roots in the fl-10s, those for air to the oil coolers and for induction in the AM-42 engine. The air passed through the supercharger into the central injection pipe and then to the conturbers.

The V-V pan sight of the l1-2 Type 3 was replaced by an PBP-IB gun sight fitted in the cockpit. The vertical radio must on the rear canopy frame of the l1-2 Type 3 was replaced by a mast that was slightly slanted to the rear and mounted on the front coronary frame.

The rndder makes balance weight seen on all l2 variants was deleted on the l1-10, as was the rndder trim with a detuning of. The l1-10 had a retractable, non-sterable tail wheel, and also had an AFA-1M camera in the rear fuselge underside.

This Hungarian Air Force h1-10, Yellow 33, had a landing gear failure on landing at Tapolos. The Yellow wing insolation on the Ini was carried by an Tapolos based l1-0s and was introduced in May of 1955. The aircraft also had an Orange spinners. (**George Purka**)

The first l1-10s were assigned to the 108th Guards Assault Aviation Regiment in the former 299h Assault Aviation Regiment in October of 1944 for conversion training. On 2 February 1945, the l1-10 e4med control with the 108th Guards Assault Aviation Regiment of the 2nd Air Army under the command of F.A. Shigarin.

A glaared canopy section was installed between the front and the rear cockpit. The armor plate, separating the plot's and rear cockpitwas deleted as was the headsets for both crew members.

The I-100T was amed with two 230ctm cameras and two 7.62km guns. But the trainers had no external bomb rates. Avicious and instrumentation was the same as the standard I-10.

The first trainers were built at GAZ-18 in Kuijnshev but in 1946, GAZ-71, at Voronenh, also been building I-10UTs. In 1949, production was phased out with a total of 100 I-10UTs being built at Voronenh.

Since there was a chronic shortage of trainers within the Soviet Annual Aviation Regements a number of single real I-10s were also converted to the two-sant trainer configuration at Field Maintenance Depets. Czechoolvakis and Hungary also converted a number of I-10s to the trainer role.

## II-10m

In the late 1940s the Iyushin launched a redesign and improvement program for the I-10,, even though it was obvious that the era of the piston enghered heavy assault aircraft was over. The lessons learned, during the Korean conflict, made it obvious that the piston enghered in I-10 and had a two and would suffer very high losses to enemy jet fibrines. In addition, the M63-15 or Yak-23 figures could not provide adequate event protection, since they survive by to fast.

During operation with Soviet and Warner Wall Axial Aviation Regements, the main wheel covers were often removed to prevent them from being damaged when the I-10 had to operate from unexpected fields of soft ground.

When the RPX0-10M radio comes became available in the post-sur period, II-10s were fitted with this device. Extremal I-10s, this failure, could be distinguished by the first reflector floor pattern mounted on the rearstage at the base of the holder. This was the most common post-war variant of the I-10 and many were exported outside of the Soviet Union.

Some late production I-10s, built after the war, had the VU-8 turnet replaced by a VU-9M turned armed with a BNN-206 motor count with 150 seconds. On late production I-10s the standard armment was driven by a762km machine guns and two 230cm cmous was replaced by two NS-23 23mm cameras with 1500s per par. These lacked the barrel fitting seen on the VU-82 cmous. The S-13 gain camera was located to a position on the standard wing. Only a few of these NS-23 equipped I-10 actually entered service with the Soviet Air Force and none of the NS-23 camera equipped I-10s were ever exported, although this late version was produced under license in Czechoolvakis.

The last I-10 left the assembly lines at GAZ-18 during 1947, while the State Aircraft Factory 71 at Voronenh continued to produce the type until 1949. The I-10 remained in service with the Soviet Air Force and other friendly air forces when NATO introduced the ASCC Reporting Name System during mid-1955, and, as a result, the aircraft received the NATO code name Best.

## II-10ut

Shortly before the end of the Great Particle War, the first prototype of the I-0UT two seat trainer was completed. The aircraft retained the same overall size of the fuselage, but a stretched rear sliding canopy was introduced for the rear instructor's cockpit which was outfitted with full dual controls. A glaared canopy section was installed between the front and the rear cockpit. The armor plate, separating the plot's and rear cockpitwas deleted as was the headsets for both crew members.

The I-100T was amed with two 230ctm cameras and two 7.62km guns. But the trainers had no external bomb rates. Avicious and instrumentation was the same as the standard I-10.

The first trainers were built at GAZ-18 in Kuijnshev but in 1946, GAZ-71, at Voronenh, also been building I-10UTs. In 1949, production was phased out with a total of 100 I-10UTs being built at Voronenh.

Since there was a chronic shortage of trainers within the Soviet Annual Aviation Regements a number of single real I-10s were also converted to the two-sant trainer configuration at Field Maintenance Depets. Czechoolvakis and Hungary also converted a number of I-10s to the trainer role.

## II-10m

In the late 1940s the Iyushin launched a redesign and improvement program for the I-10,, even though it was obvious that the era of the piston enghered heavy assault aircraft was over. In this prototype was converted from a standard production I-10 and had a two and a half foot (750km stretch added to the fuselage and the retractable tail wheel was moved to the rear. The direction finding loop antenna was replaced by a rating under the fuselage. A new wing to the Clark WH profile, that featured constant dihedral from the root, was fitted. This wing and the main landing gear for pass electrodes enlarged and moved slightly out-broad, increasing the wheel track by 10 per cent. The main wheels were enlarged and there were slight increases in real end of capacities.

The four NS-23 230cm cameras, fitted on the last production batches of the I-10, were required by NR-23 230cm cameras with an unminution supply of 150 rounds per gun. The NR-23 had an improved amminution model system and a higher rate of fire, 5800 per per minute instead of 580 ppm. The meg weight rose from 4.650 kg (I-10) to the 5.570 kg (I-10M) and the gross weight went from 6.500 kg to 7.320 kg.

The I-10M prototype flew the first time in the Summer of 1951 with Vladimir K. Kokianian et the controls. The performance of the I-10M was generally inferior to that of the I-10. The top speed dropped from 551 km/h on the I-10 to 476 km/h on the I-10M prototype was fitted with an entirely new wing with NR-23 **canons in place of the NS-230km guns.** The aircraft also had a wider blade added to the windscreen. The I-10M was built in small numbers and saw only limited service. (Van Nauro)A Pair of Czech Air Force Aix B-33s. In contrast to the usual Warsaw Pact practice of no upper wing markings, Czech B-33s carried the national insights on the wingpersurfaces. The practical codes on the fuseluge were White. (Zebra) TRZ type. The rate of climb was also reduced, the II-10 needed 1.6 minutes to climb to 1,000 meters, the II-100 needed 2.1 minutes.

The II-100 was built in small numbers between 1951 and 1954, but the performance of the B-10 during the early stages of the Korean conflict clearly showed that the aircraft would suffer heavy losses on the modern battlefield. Between 1944 and 1954 a total of 4,966 II-10s and II-10Ms had been built in the Soviet Union.

## Appendix B-33

In the late 1940s, negotiations were started to produce the II-10 under license in Czechchowska for export to countries within the Soviet sphere of influence. This decision was taken to allow the Soviet Union to concentrate their resources to the manufacture of more sophisticated aircraft such as the MiG-15 fighter and I-28 twin engined jet medium bomter.

The production of the II-10 was phased out at Voronah during 1949 and a short time later all documentation on the type was transferred to Czechoslovakia. It was planned to produce the aircraft in the Avia plant at Cavokoe near the Czech capital of Prague. One early production Soviet built II-10 served as a pattern aircraft, although the variant to be produced would be the late production aircraft equipped with four NS-23 23nd carnons. Additionally, V-8 turned us replaced by an BTN-2062 Jonkm annuch in the V-90-84urt.

The first B-33 (Serial 1073) assembled at the Avia plant, made its first flight on 26 December 1951. This aircraft was powered by a Soviet-built AM-38 engine since the Czech license built Avia M-24 power plant had not been certified for production. On 13 May 1952 the second prototype B-33 (Serial 1074) successfully passed its first factory test flight. This aircraft was equipped with a Czech manufacturer M-42 power plant and served as a pattern aircraft for the production version.

The two external differences between a late production II-10s and the Czech B-33s were the lack of a direction finding long long antenna on the rear fuselage, and milieu Soviet shell II-10s had a slightly backward slanted radio mast, the B-33s and a vertical radio mast. In addition, there was no provision for a DAG-10 dispensor on Czech built B-33s. Early B-33 had a S-13 gain camera fitted in the starboard wing, but most B-33s had the gun camera deleted and the opening flaired over.

The B-33s experienced some teething problems which were overcome through a joint modernization and improvement progeny by the Avia plant and the Flight Research Institute. When these problems were all solved, large scale production started at Cavokoe during late 1952. With the exception of the BTN-206 camnon, which was imported from the Soviet Union, most parts for the B-33 were produced in Czechoslovakia.

altimeter were fitted on the lower fuselage. In the mid-1950s, the IRRO-130 tube launched, organized rocket was introduced and some B-33 were outflowed to us this weapon. Other B-33 were equipped with a net under the wing to collect the shells during firing trials. All these features were unique to Czech Ari Force B-33.

In 1958 the Ansstati Aviation Division was disbanded, but some regimens continued to operate B-33s in the reconnaissance and observation roles. The type was also well suited to the forward air controller ride, affecting artillery fire. A number of B-33s and CB-33s miners were clipped in Russian heater test-bed for various items of equipment, including Cech manufactured parentheses and ramament. A B-35 served as a steel bed for the evaluation for the rail launched IR-130 unguided rocket and this same aircraft conducted tests with German SC-70 bends. The last flight of a B-33 was on 26 April 1962.

CB-33

During 1952, the Czech Ava factory at Cakovic began producing a trainer variant of the B-33 designated the CB-33. The CB-33 was delivered both as an armed and unarmed trainer versions. Some of the armed variants carried the same common emanamental as the B-33,3/or NS-23X42 X320xaton, which must were warted with two NS-23X40 cmnes, C-33s-infected intended as pure trainers, were delivered with no armament and the slots for the shell ejectors on the under side of the wing were timed over. Later Ava built CB-33s defined from the standard production trainers in having a triangle shaped, slightly forward slanted radio mast. These late production CB-33s had the rear sliding rear canopy replaced by a canopy which opened to the starboard side. Production of the CB-33 was phased out during 1955.

## Experts

A number of early and standard production II-10 were exported to countries within Moscow's sphere of influence. Most were not factory fresh, but were transferred from Soviet Assist Aviation Regiments, when they converted to the late production I-10 with four NS-23 cameras. All were equipped with the direction florier loop antenna on the rear fuselage, just in front of the tail. Czech built B-33 were never directly exported from the Ava factory to a **line-up of Ava B-33s assigned to the Polish 30th Naval Aviation Regiment. These after weather modelling with underwater rocket trails. The flaring on the centerline of the lower fuselage housed an ADF antenna. The straight antenna was another identification feature for the B-33. (MariusKonarski)**

client country. The export of B-33s was handled by the Ministry of Defense and the Czech Air Force. The aircraft were delivered to the Czech Air Force and then from to military air-fields. Czech Air Force plots then ferried to the asteroid in the destination country, where they were handled over. B-33s were exported to Bulgaria, Poland, Romania and North Yemen. The People's Republic of Bulgaria received its first Soviet built I-10 in 1984 to equip a single ASAN Aviation Regiment, which was based at Pirokiv Air Base. Later, the country took delivery of a member of Czech manufactured B-33s. They were passed out in the Spring of 1958.

The Czech received their first Soviet-built II-10s in late Summer of 1950. These aircraft were allocated to the 30th Asstati Aviation Regiment of the 4th Mixed Aviation Division. When sufficient numbers of B-33s from Czech production became available, the original Soviet II-10s were quickly withdrawn from service.

Hungary received its first flying II-10s between 9 and 14 September 1949. Another nine were delivered in November of 1950 and between the 17 February 1953 and 7 July 1953, another 100-110s air served.

These are all es-Soviet Air Force aircraft and some showed signs of battle damage and it was generally assumed by the Hungarians that these had once served in Korea. During general wetland in Hungary, it was also found that some of these I-10 had to less than three different layers of emit. A total of 1959 West built I-10s were used in Hungary and according to Hungarian tradition, the type received the name _Parking_ (Panther).

The first II-10s were allocated to an Assist Aviation Squadron of the Mixed Regiment based at Kcsckment and to the Aviation Officers Academy at Szolnok. Between 1949 and 1951, Hungarian national markings were very similar to those of the North Korean Air Force. The Red star on the White background was surrounded by three circles. The inner circle was Green, followed by a White and a Red circle. This style of national markings was changed in

On 1 October 1951, three Assault Aviation Regimeters were formed and each regiment could be identified by the color of the aircraft's spinner: Orange for Tapodex, Lemon-Yellow Borgond and Light-Blue for Stexekekert-Taxe. During 1955, the Supreme Command of the Hungarian Air Force replaced the piston enginel 1-10s with by MidG-15.s. As a result the remaining B-10 and B-10UT were scraped.

The Republic of Indonesia obtained a number of ex-Polish B-33s during 1957. The negotiations for these aircraft were carried out under very strict security. The B-33 destined for Indonesia were converted for long range dates and two vein parts were filled in the mid-wing area in order to accommodate a 400 liter under foreign leadtanks. The Indonesia were not plessed with the B-33 and, as a result, all were re-canted, returned to Poland and scrapped.

The Democratic People's Republic of Korea (North Korea) received a number of Soviet built B-10 before the outbreak of the Korean War. Our 25 June 1950, a massive surprise attack was launched against the Republic of Korea and a number of low level attacks were performed by North Korean Assault Aviation Regimeters during the opening phase of the Korean conflict. Some of the I-10s attacked Seoul and its Kirpo airport, causing panic among the civil civilians. A number of attacks were also made against South Korean robots. But generally, the contribution of the I-10 during the initial stage of the conflict was very slight.

On 27 June 1950, eight I-10s from Yomo Air Base crossed South heading for Kinpo air-field were then disrupted in disrupting the refugee shift. Before they could become litter attack, they were bounced by four F-80s of the 35th FRS and with minutes for the surviving I-10s were heading for the sunfactory after union to re-show the event. After this engagement, the North Koreans refund from sending more aircraft to the Seoul-Korea area.

During the initial stage of the Korean conflict the United Nations force captured at least three times it-10.4 or various airfields. A number of damaged I-10 do not fit into Union Unioned forces hands during their advance into the North. Two I-10s, bearing the tactical numbers. Yellow 44 and Yellow 55, were found by USAT personnel in the demolished hangers of Klimor airfield with United Nations roposed itself in September of 1950.

These I-10s found were subsequently shipped, still carrying full North Korean markings to the Wright Air Development Center at Wright Petterson AFB, Dayton, Ohio. Before flight testing began, the North Korean markings were replaced by American national markings. The North Korean tactical numbers remained on the tail along with a Wright Air Development Center, Wright Petterson AFB, Ohio carrying the ADC registration T2-3000 on the tail and USAF mandates on the rear Wiestige during the Summer of 1951. A total of eleven flights were conducted with the I-10. (USAF)

The test were conducted to aid the Air Technical Intelligence Center in making future estimates of the performance of foreign aircraft. Captain Stephens reported that, as a result of the counterclockwise rotation of the propeller, the aircraft had a tendency to pull to the right, in sharp contrast to USAT single-engine aircraft, which had a tendency to pull to the left.

Pollan received its first Soviet manufactured I-10 during 1949. Initially Poland refused deliveries of the I-10 because the type was regarded as absolete. A total of forty II-10s were assigned to the three Assault Aviation Rings, which were at that time also equipped with the l-2 Type 3 and as a result, mixed formations with both types were formed.

In early 1953s with Urged Credit- built B-33 and underwasser assigned to the 30th Navy Aviation Wing. Philip quotes were not expressed by the II-10 and B-33. During operation, the AM-42 engines with odd foreign and this led to a number of crashes and forced landing. From mid-1957 toward, the Polish Air Force started to progressively withdraw all remaining I-10s and B-33s from service. The last II-10 and B-33 were formed from Polish Air Force with active during the 1959 and scrapped.

In March 1953, the first thirty Soviet built I-10s and II-10UTs were delivered to Romania to equip the three Regimes of the 68th Assault Aviation Group. Most of the aircraft received were ex-Soviet Air Force and showed signs of extreme wear. In April of 1953, a total of 150 Czech built B-33 and CB-33 were delivered and, as a result of this shipment, Romania became the larger operator of the B-33 outside of Czechworks. Each of the three Regimes required forty-five aircraft and fifteen were sent to the Amer Vilator Aviation School at Boboca. With the delivery of the B-33s and their generally bad overall condition the I-10s, were quickly withdrawn from service.

In October of 1958 it was decided to ferry fifty of the B-33s that were in the best condition to Canivivia Air Base where they were stored in hangers. In June of 1960, Romanian military aviation was recognized, and it was decided to withdraw the remaining B-33 from active service and replace them with MG-15s.

In 1957, twenty-four crted B-33s and CB-33s were delivered the Czech Air Force to the Kingdom of Yemen, which became the Yemen Arab Republic (North Premier) during 1962. The aircraft were delivered without amament to Yemen and were reassembled by Czech specialists. Besides the B-33 and the CB-33, the Czech government also delivered a number of Zin Z-126 and Yakovlev Yak-11 trainers to Yemen.
