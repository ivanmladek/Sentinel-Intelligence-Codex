## Introduction

No design can challenge the PBY Catalina for being the most successful flying boat ever produced. In production continuously for over ten years, it was built in larger numbers than any other flying boat. In fact, it was built in larger numbers than all other flying boats combined, Ironically, the PBY would probably never have been produced had considered so undetected Douglas in mid-1935, where the Navy requested bids from the industry for a production batch of patrol planes based on the Consolidated XKPY-1 and the Douglas XKPY-10-15. The competing designs had both completed successful flight test programs and hard time all specified performance requirements with no signful card problems. When hard-in-in-general performance, the choice between the two aircraft came down to price -- and Consolidated's bid of 5900,000 per plane, being substantially lower than the Douglas bid of 51710,000, on the contract.

The PBY was named "Cataline" by the British in November 1940, shortly after delivery of the first of many PBYs that would eventually serve with the RAF. The Catalina was arm-ed for the first eight of the California coast, satisfying the RAF requirement that aircraft names be representative of the manufacturer. When the United States officially deemed more attracted to aircraft in 1944, many British designers for airplanes common to the two nations, including Calating for the PBY, were adopted. The Canabians identified the RCAF version of the "PSY flights" bag as "Canso" and the amphilia as "Canso" A:" still another, not widely known name for a PBY variant, was "Nomad", the name selected for the PBY-1, a major endered on the PBY's undertaken and produced by the Naval Aircraft Factory at Philadelphia in 1944-45.

Written-of as Obsessions by the U.S. Navy in 1939 when the past of the PBY-1 had been delivered, and with prototypes of proposed replacements already flying (thin engine XKPA Mariner, and the e-engaged XK92F Coronado and XK93), the PBY continued in production of because Consolidated received substantial foreign orders for the Model 28.5 (export version of the PPY-10, from Britain, Canada, Australia, France and the Netherlands). The Pey was the only available maritime pattern that could satisfy the urgent trend of the Allies as they Delayedly repeated for war. Then in December 1939 the U.S. Navy conducted for 2007 PSY models, the largest single order for naval aircraft state WHO Warf. These contracts provided the first of the aircraft which would earn the Catalina the requisite on the sea-going shortage of World Warf. In actual aviation,

Of the some 3.300 Calating beats and amphibians produced, nearly a hundred are still trying today. And, the PBY continues to demonstrate the versatility and dependability which originally earned the "p-bear" for rebutquants as a p-aware, d-affinity workhorses. In spite of being a 47 year old design, there is no airplane available anywhere better suited for the tasks the PBY takes in strides. The old cat flights treat fires as water bombers, files geological surveys with magnetometers, transports personnel, supplies and heavy equipment to otherwise inaccessible areas, and with new lawvivators optimized in interiors, files sortmen into virgin windframes areas for hunting and fishing.

## Early Consolidated

Flying Boats

The PBY design evolved at Consolidated under the guidance of butilat aerialengine-Isaac Macklin "Mac", Laddow, who joined the company in 1927. Rebuen Fleet, Consolidated's founder, was determined to extend the firm's business from the successful military features (Army PP and Namy NP) then in production at the plant in Buffalo. To heavy multi-engine aircraft for which the Army had established new requirements. To enhance Consolidated's capabilities in this area, their employed London and teamed him with veteran multi-engine aircraft designer jor Siroards in order to refer the 1927 competition for the design of a heavy bomter. Laddow had been Chief of the Army aircraft engineering section at Wright Field, responsible for multi-engine design, and additionally as a private venture, had headed a team of engineers which designed a long-range flying boat under 4

The Navy's first monoplane patrol boat, the Consolidated XKPY-1 Admiral, was a clean break with the line of bipane flying boats started in World Warf. (Convalid) contract to the Boeing company.

The Consolidated-Skykykyky entry in the 1927 bomber competition was a twin-engine bibane based on an earlier design, the S-37, which Sikorsky had built for a Transatlantic flight attempt. Their joint design, named "Guardian", was outclassed by its competitor, the Curtis B-2 "Connor", which won the production contract, have-the-less, Laddon and his engineering team had gained valuable experience for Consolidated which would be utilized in the immediate future.

## XPY-1 Admiral

First of the design series, which ultimately evolved into the Catalina, was Consolidated's XKPY-1. This high-wing all-metal monoplane was an entirely new concept in long-range sealing design and was a clean break with the line of bipane flying boats that started with the Giant Coutras "America" in 1914. Developed by the Navy, whose design was offered to the aviation industry for bids for the construction of a prototype. Consolidated was two longer and an RFA5928 received a 5150,000 contract for the development and construction of the new flying boat. After almost a year of all-out effort, much of it involving the development of new techniques for the fabrication of the then revolutionary aluminum alloys, the XKPY-1 Admiral was completed in December. A previously unbinned of problem now confronted the builders -- a completely ice closed Nagana River -- no place to test the new sentiker Rahair that wait for the Spring thase, Consolidated, with Navy conounce, opted to have the new boat disassembled and shipbed by rail to NAS Anachasia, where flight tests could be conducted.

The XKPY arrived at Anacosta during the Christmas holidays and reassembly, under Mac Laddow's supervision, was also upon immediately. Following round tests, a first flight was successfully on January 299, with Navy Lieutenant at W. Gorton that the controls and Mac Laddon, as was this custom, riding the co-pills seat. At this point in its history, Consolidated had no beamline pilot in its employ and was forced to borrow it. Gorton from the Navy for the flight.

Performance of the XKPY fitting test flights met all requirements and in June 1929 the Navy offered the design to qualified bodies for a production batch of an one planes based on the Consolidated prototype. Consolidated's bid, which included substantial engineering costs incurred during the design design design, was substantially higher than the bid submitted by the Glen. A Martin Co, which was awarded the production contract.

Unaudated by this turn of events, Consolidated immediately initiated the development of a 28 passenger commercial flying boat based on the XKPY design. The new Segalero called "Commodore", was utilized by the New York, Rio, Business Aires, the (NYRWBA) and its successor, Pan American Alrays, in the first successful airline service to the Caribbean and South America. The Commodore continued in airline service for many years, establishing new standards for passenger comfort and reliable performance.

earlier model. A pair of Wright Cyclone engines of 575 hg replaced the 460 hp Pratt & Whitney Wasso of the XPV. The XPV2-1 first two on 26 March 1932 in the three-engine configuration. The third engine was removed early in the flight test program after it was determined that it provided a significant improvement in performance over two engines. In an unprecedented demonstration of confidence in Consolidated, the Navy had awarded a production contract for 23 of the new boats under the designation P2Y-1, on 7 July 1931 - less than three months after the order for the prototype and more than nine months prior to the prototype's first flight!

The Navy's confidence in Consolidated was well-placed. The p2Y proved to be an exceptionally capable pilot plane, establishing performance records and pioneering patrol squadron tactics that became the test standard well into World War II. When the P2Y's were mistaken from Navy records, 41 of the 47 aircraft delivered were still operating, after more than six years of fleet and training command service.

## Xp3y-1

In 1932, with P2Y deliveries underway, the Navy announced a design competition for a new patrolling bus, specifying a performance envelope that would significantly extend fleet capabilities. The new P2Q was to leave a 3,000 time range at a curbing speed of 100 mph and a maximum grossuli of 25,000 bcs.- nearly twice that of the XP1-Mack Laddon and the Consolidated engineering team welcome the challenge of a new design effort, confident that the experience gained during the development of the p2Y and its record breaking performance in fleet operations assured a high probability of success for the new design.

The results of their effort was a radical new sealing, unique enough in design to qualify for a patient who 30,921 in Mac Laddon's name was issued by the US. Patent Office on 31 July 1934. Following preliminary review of the proposed Navy on 20 October 1933, awarded a contract to Consolidated for further development of the design and construction of a single prototype under the designation P2Y-1. The final step in the evolution to the P2Y's Catalins was underway.

Consolidated's major competitor for this Navy patrol plane contract was the Douglas company. Douglas, a registered front with a reputation for the design and production of successful unit-engine aircraft, and proposed the XP30-1 to the Navy as an entry in the 1932 competition. On 20 May 1933, this renorts prior to the award of the XYP development contract to Consolidated, Douglas received a contract to produce a single prototype of their design. The Douglas bus was not a design requirement as the Consolidated proposal. The Douglas XP30 was a modification of an earlier Douglas amphain Army number, the Y81-1, without several changes and redesignations - to Y0-44, then Y0-45, but had fewer gone into production. A shoulder wing monitoring, low Pratt and Whitney W1830 engines in prepromounted reaches along the wing, it was similar to the commercial Dolphin and the USROWW. We series utility transports. The SP30 was slightly smaller than the XP3 and had marginally better performance in clump, speed and range. Douglas first five met new P2Q on 6 February 1933, used over a common before the first flight of the Consolidated XP30.

The Consolidated XP30 was exceptionally cleanly aerominically. Refractive floats formed the tips of a parcol system-emailure using mounted on a nylon above the hull, with a pair of struts on each side providing additional support. The wing was a conventional aluminum alloy structure, metal-covered forward of the rear gear with fabric on the art of protection. Airclores were fabric-covered metal structures. Full cantilever horizontal stabilizers were metal-covered with fabric-covered elevators. The integral vertical flipped in supported fabric-covered holder. Control surfaces are all provided with time tags.

Defensive arrangement consisted of a 30.30 caliber Brewing machine gun mounted in the bow and manners by the bombardier, the waist gun positions on each side of the half at the wing nylon accomodated a single Browning of either 30 or 50 caliber. Offensive armment provisions included under-wing stations outboard of the wing struts which could acpelliers were three bladed consinant speed, full festheing Hamilton Standard.

Construction of the new P-Q-best prototype at Consolidated's plant in Buffalo was started late in 1933 and continued through 1934, with competition early in 1938. To avoid any possible delay due to winter ice in the Niagara River separate operating area, an early decision was made to ship the X93Y by rail to NAS Norfolk, where Navy facilities could be utilized for assembly, and ground and flight tests.

## 5 XP3Y Flight Tests

The XP3Y prototype arrived at Norfolk in early March 1985 and by mid-month, had satisfactorily completed the required preflight tests. On 21 March Consolidated test pilot Wheatly made the first flight in the new beat - which was an unquantified success Company West flying continued with no significant problems and on 28 March the XP3Y was delivered to the Navy at the NAS Anacousita test station for preliminary trials. Minor problems were encountered but none were significant or caused any delay. Gun fitting inputs were made in April, and in May the phase returned to Norfolk for tough water instead and landing tests. During a landing on 13 May the P-Q-best was damaged, but was quickly repaired and testing continued.

During these flight tests there were continuing reports of directional stability and control problems and a number of changes had been met to an improvement. Bombing trials during May and June were unstimulatory because of the marginal directional stability and high rudder forces. The rudder was crowded with added area but the change produced unexpectedly high rudder forces, and the rudder was modified again.

In July the XP3Y was returned to Norfolk to continue rough water tests, and on 27 July, was extensively damaged during a landing. The full published and water pit doors held and the plane was towed back to the NAS for repairs. Robot water trials were completed successfully in October for the Coronado Islands on the West Coast, following a record-breaking terry flight from the East Coast via the Canal Zone.

The final report of the Naval Total Board found the XP3Y-1 "Accaptable" for production. Several recommendations for improvement in flying qualities and operational capability included.

-Provide an additional gun station firing down and at

improve the waist gun stations by providing better wind screens for the gunners.

-improve bomb loading provisions.

-Modify the rudder and its control system to improve stability and directional control.

-improve the bow gun station.

However, much more significant to the future of the PBY were the Board's findings regarding performance:

\begin{tabular}{c c c}  & actual & QUANTED \\ Maximum Speed & 170.8 & 159 \\ Minimum Speed & 56.8 & 60 \\ Service Calling & 18,600 & 15,000 \\ Max Off (165) & 22 & 60 \\ Weight Empty & 12,567 & 13,046 \\ \end{tabular}

Consolidated signed a contract for 60 PBY-1s on 29 June 1935 and the new plant at San Diego began toulio-go for the production run. Trial board recommended changes included: new rudder, full extension at under the rudder, addition of another gun position in the tail compartment (promptly and forever after dubbed “the tunnel gun”), changes to the bow gun turret, muscle changes and installation of production R-1380-64 engines.

**XP3Y-1**

**Original Tail**

The XP3Y was inducted into the San Diego plant for incorporation of these changes and was redesigned XP3Y-1 on completion of the network but retained the original Bureau of Aeronautics serial number (BuNO 4956). Addition of the “6” to the designation recognized the new P-board capability of delivering a significant bomb load. Company pilot Bill Wheatly made a final demonstration flight and on 21 May 1936 there was delivered to the Navy for their flight tests. These were completed satisfactorily, with minor rudder and rudder control system changes being required. However, a major deficiency which had been detected early in the prototypes' flight tests was directional stability and control. The modified rudder and rudder controls incorporated in production aircraft reduced the problem to an acceptable level, but it was not satisfactorily eliminated until a complete redesign of the vertical and horizontal slit surfaces by Navy engineers on the PBN, the PBP2B-2, and the final PBY variant, the PBY-6A.

The Navy's high regard for the new PBY was further demonstrated by a follow-on contract for 60 PBY-2 boats awarded on 25 July 1938, two months before the first production PBY-1 was delivered in September

PBY-2 Flying Boat

A contract for production of the PBY-2 model had been signed on 25 July 1936, more than a month prior to the delivery of the first PBY-1. The 50-2s ordered were essentially the same as the earlier model and were powered by the same Paul K Whitney R-1830-64 engines of 860 HP. A new, solid one before horizontal stabilizer with inset elevations was a major change. A cutoff was added to the water for clearance. Fourteen for the production batch were equipped with the Curtis electric properties. These were the only PBY's not equipped with Hamilton Standard prog.

The first PBY-2 was completed in June 1937, with Patton Squadron 11 at San Diego being the first test test to receive the new model, having 2 to 20 hand by October 1937.

2, from Coc Solo, Bad exceeded 12 by the end of November and year further-based VP-10 received another 12 by the end of the year. VP-20 and VP-17 were partially equipped with 25 by the end of January 1938 as the last of the new P-bots were delivered.

Following a repeated established with the PBY-1, autonomous being equipped with the new model proved to San Diego for transitional training, then fleew the new planes back to their regularly assigned bases.

PBY-2s Iee 4 PBY-2s to Coc Solo in the Canal Zone on 8 December 1937. On 19 January 1938, Pioneer Transgate Squadron W-10 exhibit that shown in PBY-1s to Hawaii in the first such "routine transfer" on 1011 January 1938 again made the long flight to Hawaii with 16 BPs, covering the 2.653 miles in 20 hours, 30 minutes. The last fleet PBY-2 was transferred from the PBY equations to the training command on 21 May 1942. The last PBY-2 was stricken from the Navy list on 30 April 1945.

In December 1937 Consolidated delivered a replacement plane to Dr. Archbold for his expedition to New Guinea. A modified BPY-2, it was designated Model 28-3 and carried the same civil registration as that originally issued to QUBA-1. No 777. The best was found across the Pacific in June 1938 to New Guinea where it was extensively used to support the expectation during the following 1's months. On completion of the expeditionary project, QUBA I was from back to the US, the long way -- around the World. The flight terminated at the New York City Worlds Fair, then in progress. In October 1940, the British purchased QUBA I for use by QUBA in West African transport service. The plane provided excellent service until it was severely damaged by a storm and scrapped in 1944.

**PBY-4 Flying Boat**

Only thirty-three pay-4 were ordered under a contract signed 18 December 1937, the smallest number of any of the pay variants, with all but the last four, which served as prototypes and test beds for the later 5 variants, being essentially similar to the earlier 3 variant. The PB7-4 was powered by the new PAW 1830F-2 engine, but at 1050 HP at layout and 90 HP at 12,000 HT along top speed was 177 mph. The propeller hubs were covered with spinners, which would be unique to the 4- series.

The last three attract achieved in the 4- series, Binks 1241, 1242 and 1243, were modified by the installation of a prototype version of what would become the Catalina trademark, what just position bisters. In addition to the blisters, 1247 was fitted with a new result that designed for the PB7-5 and with prototype engine mascelies.

The first attract of the new series and achieved to VP-1 at San Diego II.01-398 and by June 1939 the squadron had 15 on hand. Yet, a Heart Pathfinder Puffing 2 unit, had turned in the IRS P15-blips and moved to San Diego for quantitative and training. Completion of the transition, the squadron made the Trangorne flight back to faugal on 28 June 1939. In September VP-1 was designated VP-1 and devoted to the Phillips to join the Asia Field. Processing via Mdecay, Wake and Giamu the squadron completed the pioneering light without incident, becoming the first significant element in a planned build-up of the U.S. Navy's Far East Avalant Iotones. In July, our willingness of Asia Field Surving of 10 mm imminent, the squadron was renumbered again, this time back to VP-1.

The only other squadron to be PB7-4 equipped with 78%, another Pattyma 2 unit. By mid-939 the squadron had 16 of the new PBY-46 data on hand and had been redesignated VP-13, but was again redesignated by VP-26 after the July 1939 Patty Squadron reorganization had been implemented. And that was not yet the final final chamber Live VP-21, the preceding year, VP-26 was ordered to the Phillips and, after a trans-Pacific flight via the route pioneered by VP-21, after the Mainia era on 16 December 1940, reporting for duty to the newly commissioned Patty Mino 3, based on the Caruit Naval Station. Assignment to the new wing necessitated a final change in designation for both the squadrons, VP-1 becoming VP-101 and VP-26 becoming VP-102.

A commercial version of the PBF-4 was sold to American Export Airlines and delivered in June of 1938. Registered NC 18997, the boat was named TRANATlantic and was used for survey flights on North Atlantic routes being proposed by the air line for mall and cargo flights. It was flowny to a crew headed by one of the US Navy's best known and most respected big boat pilots, Warrant Officer Patrick J. "Paappy" Byrnes. The TRANATlantic was eventually taken over by the US Navy (9980) in 1944 and used as cargo aircraft.

Consolidated's final commercial PBF sale was another modified PBF-4, purchased by the British in July 1939 to evaluate the design. On delivery, the boat was ferried by the GUBA crew from San Diego to Felixstone, the British experimental and test base. The flight, via Bofwood, was the first Transatlantic delivery of a military aircraft during World Air. If 99-69 was two through tested at the Marine Aircraft Experimental Establishment at Felixstove by RAF squadron personnel, who were favorably impressed.

PBY-5 Catalina Flying Boat

The autumn of 1939 initially looked break for the Consolidated PBY program, it had been nearly a year since the last PBY-4 had been delivered to the Navy, and prototypes of new living boats were under development. First line service days of the PBY seemed to be nearing at end, and Consolidated had the advanced model 31 under development. However, the British declaration of war on Germany after Hitter's invasion of Poland in September, immediately brought an order from the RAF for 106 Consolidated Export Model 28-5 (PBY-55) under the British designation Catalina 1. And on an 20 December 1939 the US Navy signed a contract for 20PBY cycles. The Navy's order for 200 PBYs, the largest order by May and placed for aircraft since World War 1, was justified by the escalating demands for patrol aircraft in order to implement the Neutrality Patrol established in September 1939.

The PBY-55 incorporated modifications that had been tested on the last three delivered PBY-4s are themselves redesigned that featured a squared-off under and new horizontal stabilizer and elevators. Waist 90u plisters replaced the sliding hattaches and waist pattern was standardized on 500 challenge paths. The 5-s was observed by a part of a quartet Pkt A Whitney-180-82 engines which provided 200 HP each at take off-fit. Inter-slit changes to the engine required the use of Hunting Standard Hydromic proplexes. Top speed was 200 miles per hour and range was 1985 miles. The PBP loop was relocated from just behind the occupied to a position on the wing, near the leading edge between the engines.

The first PBY-5s was accepted by the Navy in September 1940. And the second PBY-5 but accepted, Bulo 2290, was transferred to the U.S. Coast Guard as 178B. A Navy contact calling for an additional 90PBY-5s was signed on 15 September 1941. Following the British lead, who had ordered their PBYs under the Catalina designation, the US Navy of the Assembly line. Bulo 2290 was turned over to the US Coast Guard. Reocded V-189, it was the first of many US Coast Guard PRYS. Aluminum over-all-whit Orange Yellow top of wing. Rudder colors are Blue at top with Red and White vertical stripes. (US10)

Catalina I & II

The 106 Export Model 28-86 ordered by Britain in 1939 were delivered beginning in November 1940. Designated Catalina I or II, depending on the minor differences in the equipment installed, the RAF planes were formed across the U.S. by civilian creas from American Export Arlines and out to Bermuda, where British crews picked them up for the final fee of the right to England. These first RAF Catalina's were delivered to Coastal Command squaders 209 and 240. A group of 16 experienced U.S. Navy ByPURGIS assisted it from TRANSFER to the new boats. W02 of 209 Squadron, with Navy Engin I. T. within flying co-pilot, was the Cat which located the BIMSARCK when the German batting escaped into the North Atlantic In May 1941.

During 1940 and 1941 Consolidated received significant additional orders for its audio repair (and only available) maintained particular aircraft, Australia ordered 18 Catalina I, Canada ordered 36 boats under the designation Cango, the Dutch ordered 36 boats for their foreses in the East Indios, and an order of 30 boats placed by France was taken over by Britain after France feel to the Germans. These export Catalina's were produced by Consolidated on the same assembly as the US ordered boats and were structurally identical to their US Navy counterparts, being rearranged internally and equipped (armament, radio, survival gear, etc.) to meet the purchasers' specifications.

During the spring of 1939 the last production PBY-4, BuNo 1245, was converted to an amphibian featuring a retractable tricycle undercarriage. The nose wheel fully retracted into the lower front hull and the main gear retracted into recesses on the fuseluge sides between the wing starts. Empty weight escalated by some 2300 lines, Designed XBP-5A, the prototype flex for the first time on 22 November 1998. Realizing the increased usefulness and versatility of the amphibian, the Navy's contact of 20 December 1998 was modified for the last thirty-three aircraft to be delivered as PBY-5A amphibians. Other notices followed suit, immediately modifying their contacts to include PBY-5A amphibians. On 25 November 1940 the Navy ordered an additional 134 PBP-5A, so more in June 1941 and another 22 in October 1941.

In 1940 the Booning Canada production facility at Vancouver was licensed to build the PBY. The first fifty-five machines were CANSO As assembled from parts made at Consolidated in the US.

The PBY-SA was delivered to the RAF under the designation Catalina III during early 1942. The eleven machines delivered were put into service on the North Atlantic Ferry route. (D Menard)

## PBN Nomad

A determined Navy effort to improve the PBY resulted in a major re-design incorporating extensive hull, wing and tail changes to improve performance and handling -- both on the water and in the air. The scope of the changes, which had originally been proposed as production modifications to be incorporated by Consolidated, were so broad that it was soon realized that it would be impracticable to attempt to the existing production lines without a serious impact on the Navy. As an alternative, a new production line was established at the Naval Air Factory in 1984 to produce the modified boat, under the designation PBN- Normal. The bow was extended and dismissed does for the bombing window incorporated. The hull introduced was extended 56 lines and a shallow breaker step was added just forward of the tail. Redesigned wing tip flots allowed for the wing was strengthened and added but far leakage was provided in the wing center section. A redesigned tail was incorporated and the electrical system was updated. Note armant was upgraded to a 5.00 caliler machine gun in a retractable power driven turnt.

Development of the changes proceeded slowly and the first of the 156 aircraft ordered was not delivered until February 1943, with the last of the tip accepted in March 1945. Only 17 PBN broadcasts were delivered to the US Navy, the remainder of the production batch had been lerried to Elizabeth City and delivered to Russian crews for delivery to the USSR.

The design changes made in the PBN-1 Nomad were to improve performance and handling characteristics on the water and in the air. (USN)Catalina VI (PB2B-2)

Flying Boat

The tail tail of the PBN was incorporated into the PB75 boat and designated Catalina VI (PB2B-2). Equipped with most of the late production changes including the thermal wing, all delta-deing, eyeball ball tow turner, and radome, they were built at the Booing Canadian plant. Most of these mechanisms saw service with the Empire's services, RAF, and RCAF, but a few were used by the US Navy under the designation PB2B-2.

PBY-6A Amphibian

The last production variant of the Catalina was the PBY-6A amphibian which incorporated the design improvements of the earlier models, especially those found on the Normal, plus additional amor, armament and radar. In order to concentrate on production of the PBY-6A? Driwater, production of the Catalina was moved to the new Consolidated plant in New Orleans (available with the cancellation of the PHY-1 Compagio). Between January and September 1945, 175 PBY-6A's were produced, with 30 going to Russia and 75 going to the USAAF as OA-108 rescue aircraft.

PBY-6A, BuNo 46542, carries out the job she was designed to do -- coastal patrol. The PBY-6A, the last production version built for the US Navy, incorporated many of the design features of the PBN-1 Nomad. (USN)

## U.S. Navy PBY Operations

Pre-World War II

U.S. Navy PBY patrol squadron operations during the waning years of peacetime consisted almost entirely of training exercises for flight and ground crews in those activities for which the PPs quadrons were traditionally responsible, which included high and low altitude bombing, gunmery, tcpole drops, off-shore patrol. The flight crews regularly flew such training missions from the seaplane base to which the squadron was assigned. Several times each year an "advanced base" exercise was conducted, usually as part of a fleet tactical exercise under simulated combat conditions. For such activities a seapple motor would provide crew and aircraft support. The ship was responsible for selecting an operating area (or was assigned one) in a not-too-distant bar or estuary, polting out morning buoys for the planes and arhaving the takted and landing lanes in the seaplane with buses of buoys. The ship provided boats for servoting the aircraft and for flight crew transportation between the ship and the planes and for policing the seaplane. The feeder's shops and storerooms provided everything required for extended operations, including major maintenance.

The Neutrality Act in late 1939 and subsequent establishment of the off-shore Neutrality Patted put the fleet patrol squadrons on virtually a combat footing and afforded the opportunity to gain soon-to-be-needed experience in all aspects of the patrol squadron mission.

## World War II

The Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor and the loss of personnel and aircraft in the Hawaiian area was a disaster to the patrol squadrons based there, twenty-seven of Patting's aircraft were destroyed and were damaged, only the three PPs on patrol during the attack were operational. At Ford island, the entire VP 22 was put out of action when a bomb hit and destroyed their ramp. This was not the case in the Philippines areas where tension had mounted steadily during the weeks prior to the attack on Pearl Harbor as Japanese and US, patrol planes avoided contact when they met in the off-shore search areas. Patting voyage to those hosting this hosting emphasized deployment to scattered outlying bags from which operations could continue at an attack came. Unfortunately, the overwhelming strength of the enemy attack and the composite loss of air control had not been anticipated and many of Patting 10's PPsPs were lost at their monograting during the first few days of combat. On 11 December, seven planes returning from patrol were destroyed by starting fisheries as they move moving.

Early engagements between the PPs-4 and enemy aircraft dramatically emphasised the PPs' vulnerability. Lack of crew armor armor and self-sealing fuel tanks, virtually assumed the success of a determined attack by enemy aircraft, in the few recorded accounts of attacks against formations of PPs, there is little evidence of any attempt by the P-outs to maintain group integrity and use mutually supporting firepower to ward off the enemy.

Under-scoring the PBT's vulnerability was the inadequacy of its highly regarded waist gun positions. The location was ideal for protection against tail attacks and the Browning machine gun was a thorough dependable weapon. However, the waist gun position lack-fared armored protection for the gunners and continuous armunition feed for the Browning. The PBT's guns were equipped with 50round emitters, standard for all similar installations. At the Browning's rate of 600 to 800 rounds per minute, a guner could tie a sensitive on the 10 second burst. He then was required to remove the empty can, see at full time for the neck and put it into the mount on the gun, then lead and charge the gun to ready it for additional time. This activity at the open waist station was clearly visible to the attacking enemy pilots, who acquired learned to take advantage of the collection gun. The effectiveness of fighter attacks could be minimized by turning in- to the fighter's attacking run, but this defense required good communication between acceptful and gun stations since BPs pilots could see safe.

ANAP of the vulnerability of the PBT's during attacks on well-defended targets was the strike launched by P-101 on 27 December 1984. Six BPs'4s took off from Ambon, Netherlands East Indies. If a dawn attack on a Japanese force in the mirror of 300, in the Sulas. The B-bands each carried three 500 bombs and the attack was planned as a horizontal horizontal hump in two 3 plane sections. Eroute the sections became separated and on arrival in the target area the lead section clicked in an attempt to regroup the formation. The second section, we have gathered the first, continued on course and, with the target in eight, started their bomb out which moved an immediate response from the Japanese AIA. Meanwhile, after 10 minutes of circling and with full daylight approaching, the formation leader initiated his attack with the first section. As the three BPSs, at 12,000 ft, turned toward the target where the now alerted ship and shore-based AAI commenced heavy and accurate fire, scoring hits on the the B-bands almost immediately. Six highters (probably Zeros) began making coordinated runs on the planes, scoring hits on every pass. Attempts to maneuver into the highters's attack runs broke-up the PBY formation, but the \(B\)- boats continued the bomb run independently. Two of the Zeros were hit and disappeared but the others continued the attack.

The lead PBY in the first section was shot down and the two using planes, recognizing that the horizontal bomb run could not be completed, pushed over and made diving attack runs on the target ships. The \(B\)- boats dropped their bombs at about 10,000, for then continued the dive as the fighter attacks persisted. One PBY was set on fire at about 1,000, in and three of the oven failed out, the other four had the burning plane after the pilot landed 1. The wing plane, two of its gammers dead, another seriously wounded and its controls partially shot away, also landed successfully, wasting into flames as it could, and down. Survivors of these events were made it back to the squadron after it was took dysive of evasion and survival.

The second section of the hit-dated formation had arrived at the target early and immediately initiated their attack. One of the planes was with odunt down the bomb run was completed, seeding hits on a Japanese cruiser and a large transport. The surviving pBy's returned safety to the base at Ambor.

PatWing 10 had 43 PBY-4s assigned when hostilites began, but by the 13th of December only 11 planes were flyable and the decision was made to move south to a Dutch base at Maanod, Celebs. From the three continued to Soranka where, on23 December, the remaining events and aircraft were merged as V-VI, with V-102 poling decommissioned. As the Japanese advance through the East Indies continued, the Wing retreated farther south, eventually reaching Australia in late February with only four surviving planes.

## Torpedo Attacks

There have been repeated references to "jury rigged". "PBY's making torpedo attacks, in fact, all models of the PBY were equipped to carry standard aircraft torpedo. An adapter, mounted on the underlying bomb tracks, carried the torpedo and the installation provided an necessarily services for a launch (running the warband, starting the motor, and electrical or manual release of the weapon). Away developed Torpedo Director Sight could be mounted on a track inside the windshield above the instrument panel to provide the pilot with sighting information and a release point during the attack run.

Many PBY torpedo attacks were made during World War II, usually multi-plane night actions early in the war. And while some successes were claimed and losses to the PBY's were minimal, there were better torpedo planes available and few Catalina attacks were reported after 1943.

## Black Cats

Of all the tactics developed and used by Catalina squadrons, the most effective and speculeut were the night search and attack operations conducted in the South and Southwest Pacific from mid-1942 until the end of the war. Black Cats tweets were developed after high pay losses during the early months of the war had dramatically emphasized the Catalina's vulnerability to _NA_ and fighter attack. Two factors contributed heavily to the success of these night operations - the advent of effective radar and the Japanese reliance on night movement of supplies and personnel, primarily by barge and landing craft, to maintain their bypassed garins in the Pacific Islands.

Night gunting something and harsing tasks had been found by patrol squadrons operating in the Soomons area from the 1942 baff the first Squadron to be specifically configured to night attack was 1972. The squadron arrived on Guadalian with Black painted PBY-Sa in December 1942 and operated from the until March 1943 when VPs4 took over the last, later Black Cats on Guadalian based on Guadalian and other islands in the Soomons included WP-II, V1-P, V5-P, and V9-I01.

As the war moved west the patrol squadrons also moved. Although usually tender based, some of the boat squadrons were hand-based as the occupied islands were developed and ramps and other required facilities were installed. Conversely, amphibian squadrons were sometimes tender-based and operated from seomons when landing fields were not available. Better radar and improved tactics increased the effectiveness of the Cats against enemy surface shipping, seriously disrupting the flow of supplies and reinforcements to Japanese island bases. Black Cat operations reached their peak in late 1943.

Post-War Operations

U.S. Navy.

The Catalina had only a brief post-war service life in the U.S. Navy. Already considered obsolescent at the start of hostillites, it had been overtaken and superseded by a new generation of patrol planes which included the Martin PBM seaplane, and the PBM-2 and PBM-2 planes. By 1948 there were only five PBs left in the fleet and a few PBs into the Reserve squadors. On 3 January 1957 the last operational Catalina, a PBF6A, of the Atlanta, Georgia Reserve was ordered first fifteen. With that action this remarkable airplane, truly the workhors of W1 Naval Aviation, passed into history.

In the immediate post-star years, large numbers of Catalanas became available on the war surplus market and were acquired by operators of chatter and air cargo services who recognized the capabilities of the plane. Striped of armor and armant, radio and radar, the Cats could build a respectable payload. More importantly, the old P-boat could get into and back out of marginal landing strips or any reasonable size body of water. Catalanas were operated by regional altitudes in scheduled passenger service in the Caribbean and Alaska but their market contribution was the movement of air/tight into remote and otherwise inaccessible sites.

In the U.S. and Canada many Catalanas were modified for use as water bomers for tighting test fires and were very successful in this unique role. Changes Incorporated leadership sealing hull compartments to provide tradeage for to 1100 gals of water, picked up at 705 seconds with the P-boat running on the water surface. A rectangle probe installed in the bottom of the hull just at that of the step can pick up 800 gallons of water in 15-20 seconds.

Another successful civil role for the Catalana is that of geophysical survey, Magnetometers and other detection equipment installed in the spacious hull are utilized in searching for mineral deposits or in the analysis of underground terrain features. The P-boat's range and modest cruise speed suit it well for this task.
