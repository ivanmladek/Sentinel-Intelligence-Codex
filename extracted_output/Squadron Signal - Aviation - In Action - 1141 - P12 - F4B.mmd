replaced the railroads from the upper wing center section, to the fuselage sides, improving engine cooling. The radiator relocation also improved safety, since in the event of an engine overheat and radiator boilowery, the pilot would not be equipped with the hot water from the radiator. The lighter weight of the Boeing built aircraft mean an increase in the top speed to 152 mph (website mph over the original MB-3). Boeing-built aircraft were designated the MB-3-A by the Army Air Service. After a period of one as a first line fighter series with units like the 50th Furth Squadron, a number were rebuilt by the Fairfield Air intermediate Dept (FAD) and revised to Kelly Field, Texas where they were used as advanced uniarcs, serving until 1927. Several aircraft were used as the movie "Wing" to simulate German Athotos fabrics.

The last MB-3A on the contract was delivered on 27 December 1922, Boeing's next fighter aircraft to enter production would be a design of their own.

**(Bipping) This aircraft was an original Boeing design built at company expense under the designator XP. The single XP-8 was powered by a Packard 24-150 engine rated at 600 hp. The radiators were mounted between the landing gear legs. (AFM)**

**Another floating original design was the XP-8 which had an all-part semi-monocoocooco Inselage and was powered by the standard 600 hp Curtiss D-2 engine. Many of the XP-9 design features were used on the later P-124F8 series. Top speed of the XP-9 was 213 mph, but the XP-9 suffered a variety of ground handling and airborne maneuvering problems. (AFM)**

liked by the test pilots, who were tired of having boiling hot water splashed in their face from the wing-mounted Cruise radiator designs. Top speed was 176 mph. Rather than the Curtiss design. In all respects the Model 15 confures the Curtis design. Curtiss; however, was an established aircraft manufacturer and the Army contracted for twenty-five PW-8s on 14 September 1923 before flight tests on the Model 15 were completed. But the Army off like the Boeing design and bought the prototype plus two others that were in production on 29 September 1923. The new airplane was designated the NFW-9, or Experimental Frunst Plane, Water-cooled, Model 9. Following a year of tests with the test Pursuit Group, all Selfridge Field, Army ordered full production of the PW-9 in September 1923.

The PW-9 differed from the prototype in having the cross-ahead and "Third Wing" landing gear replaced by a divided seed late system which also sketches the legs joined by its faculae. The engine owing was refined and the "damps" were replaced by individual exhaust stacks. The PW-9 also had a reinforced vertical fan and the surge with ten dark was eliminated. Larger wheels and tires were added later in the production run. The first of thirty production PW-9s on the Boeing assembly line on 30 October 1923. Following Army acceptance tests stand Point Field, the PW-9s were shipped directly to Army units in Hawaii, The Philippines, and the Panama Canal Zone.

## PW-9A

The PW-9A was essentially the same aircraft with some minor internal changes and a steerable tail sided. The Army purchased twenty-five PW-9A. One PW-9A had an improved engine installed, the Curtiss D-12D, and was tested as the PW-9B. The PW-9C was an Army production order for the re-engined PW-9B with still more improvements. Along with the 12D engine, the PW-9C had improved oil and new systems, still larger wheels and tires, improved engine moments and a new set. Essentially, the PW-9C was identical to previous models except for a new paint job which included the newly adopted Boeing-designed Army rudder stripes. The Army accepted the first of forty PW-9C on 9 July 1927.

## FB-1

In December 1924, the US Navy opted to boy the Boeing Model 15 design. Fourteen were ordered and designated the Boeing FB-1. They were virtual twins to the Army PW-9 with only minor Navy-specified equipment changes. Ten of the original production run were built as land-based fighter aircraft and assigned to U.S. Marine air units, including VF-100 in China.

## FB-2/3/4

The FB-2 was an FB-1 with reinforced landing gear and an arrester hook system for carrier landings. Two were built and evaluated before being returned to FB-1 standard and assigned to the Marines. The FB-3 had two significant changes over both the FB-1 and the PW-9. First, it had ftings on the underscript of the wing and fusefuge for attachment of a pair of floats. Second, it was equipped with the new Packard IA-1500 engine track at 510 h. With the additional power available, the Navy found one of the same problems that Army had been complaining about since the first tests of the Model 15, inadequate directional stability. An entirely new, taller rudder assembly, with a large rounded balance area ahead of the rudder 
## 11 **Fb-5**

Navy accepted twenty-seven FB-5s beginning in July of 1927. The FB-5 had the taller radar and Packard engine and the FB-3. There was, however, a major design change with the FB-5s. The wings were re-assigned. The upper wings was moved forward 6 inches while the lower wings were moved at one full feselage station. Additionally, the FB-5 had a new landing gear and redesigned engine and radiator coil contour. The engine was upgraded with the Packard 2A-1500 radar at 255 h/o. As with the FB-3, the FB-3 had four provisions although none were fitted. FB-5s served with both land-based Marine air units and carrier-based Navy air units.

## 12 **Fb-6**

The FB-4 that had been fitted with the Wright P-1 radial engine was re-engined with one of the brand new Part and Whitney R-1340 Wang radius rated at 400 bp and redesigned FB-6.

## F2b/f3b

Prior to the Boeing EB, all previous aircraft flow off aircraft carrier decks had been land planes modified and reinforced for carrier operations. The Boeing F2B was designed specifically from the outset for carrier operations.

The F2B, Boeing Model 69, was a direct descendant of the F5-P and resembled it in many ways. The fructose utilized the welded steel tube frame introduced on the PW-9/EB series, but was much rounder in appearance. The vertical tail and raoder assembly was also similar to the PW-9/W strip a large chance area that extended forward the raoder hinge line. The wires were the same as found on the F5-P with the exaggerated stagger. The aircraft was removed by a path # Whitney R-1340 Wap radial engine meter at 425 bp. One major difference was the landing path which was amplified and strengthened.

The first F2B-1 came off the Boeing assembly line in October of 1926, with the first flight lasting place on 3 November 1926. Boeing hit hit entry-two F2B-1's with deliveries to the U.S. Navy beginning in late January 1928. The Navy accepted thirty F2B-1's, with the final two being Joon and Brazil for evaluation tests.

The F3B-1 was a refinement of the F2B-1 design. The fuseluge was of a similar design but was two feet longer than the F2B-1. The vertical tail/raoder assembly was completely redesigned with almost twice the area of any previous Boeing fighter. And both the vertical and horizontal tail surfaces were of an all-metal construction with corrugated aluminum strip rather than flink-covered wood. The wings were an entirely new design. Although employing the exaggerated stagger of the F2B-1, the F3B-1 upper bound argues that expected (specspecity) back with no straight-across center section. Additionally both the upper and lower wings had rounded wingups. The aierens were also all-metal with corrugated aluminum skin. Finally,

Fuselage Development

F2B-1

**The Boeing Model 69 prototype became the prototype XF2B-1 which flew for the first time on November 1926. The XF2B-1 had a Pratt & Whitney R-1340 engine rated at 425 bp, pointing at a top of 154 nm (Boothing)**

the F3B-1 had tumours for the installation of a single center float on the fuselage centric and outward floats on the lower outer wing. Power for the F3B-1 was again supplied by a coloured flink on the lower outer wing. Power for the F3B-1 was again supplied by a coloured flink on the lower outer wing. Power for the F3B-1 was again supplied by a coloured flink on the lower outer wing. Power for the F3B-1 is with the hot means of the original F3B-1 design actually offered very little from the F2B-1, with the hot means the only central difference. The F3B-1 made its first flight on 2 March 1927. Showing no movement over the F2B-1, the Navy rejected the Boeing proposal. Boeing rebuilt the F3B-1 with the new tapered wing, round vigtings, and all-metal tail surfaces. The height aircraft needs first flight on 3 February 1928, with deliveries to the Navy beginning in November of 1928. Amarnement remained the same as previous models, a pair of 30 caliber machine guns in the upper oval, or one 30 and one.50 caliber guns. One difference between the F2B-1 and F3B-1 was addition of undergoing and feselage racks and release mechanisms for carriage of up to five 250 pounds. The U.S. Navy accepted seventy-three production F3B-1.

**This F2B-1 from Bombing Two carries special markings used in the making of the movie "Plying Piets" which was released in 1928. Production F2B-1's had the same counter-balanced ruder as used on the earlier F3B-1 (SUN Via Bol Lawson)**

## F4B/p-12

The Boeing Model 83 was the next step in the Boeing fighter aircraft series. With the success of the F2B-1/F3B-1 behind it, Boeing made a decision to build a small, lightweight fighter prototype, powered by an aco-cold final engine, that would outperform all other fighter aircraft in service with any nation. Using many of the best assets of the of the previous waits, plus the addition of a completely new breakage design, the Model 83 would eventually evolve into the top right corner of both the Air Corps and Navy/Mylar at similar depths during the early 1930s.

The Model 83 used the metal fusside frame as seen on previous Boeing fighter designs - with a difference. Where the previous models had utilized a welded steel framework, the Model 83 would have an aluminum framework that was both together. The Model 83 also had all all-uminum all assembly with corrugated aluminum skin, similar to that found on the F3B-1. The freebase, however, was over four and a half of better than the F3B-1. The engine remained the venerable Part A Whitney R1-340W Van Haight, now ruled at 45bp. Amanmanet also remained the same as that found on previous types, e similar of 3.03 caliber machine ours or one -30 and one -50 caliber machine gun synchronized to free through the propeller arc.

The wing was also an entirely design. The new wing employed a straight leading and trailing edge, compared to the target wing found on the F3B-1. Wings were rounded and the wings had the exaggerated stagger as found on the F3B-1. Wing construction was similar to previous variants with two scars and routed on midway bending. Both wings were fabric-covered with corrugated aluminum alters. The span was only third rotor, there feet shorter than the F3B-1.

The Boeing Model 83 was the prototype for the F4B/F3B-1 series. Two prototypes were built, the Model 89 (F4B) had a split-nice landing gear and carrier arresting gear, while the Model 89 (P-12) had a spreader-bar angle. The prototype's first flight came on 7 August 1928. (Waran Book)

Boing built two prototypes at their own expense, the Model 83 and Model 89. Each was both the same and different from the other to meet different requirements of the two competing services. The Model 83 had a spreader-bar landing gear arrangement and was equipped with an arrester hook for aircraft carrier landings. The Model 89 used a standard Boeing split-nice landing gear and could carry a 500 bound under the fusside. Both aircraft had provisions to carry a 55 gallo auxiliary fuel tank between the landing gear legs and both had provision for carrying bombs under the wings. Strangely, although Boeing was aiming the series at both services requirements, both the Model 83 and 89 were initially equal by the Navy. The Model 83 took to the air for the first time on 25 June 1928 and was then sent to North Island Naval Air Station in San Diego for evaluation. The Model 89 was shipped by rotation to NAS Anaccia near Washington, DC, making its first flight one -7 August 1928. Although not Navy property (yet), both aircraft were already being referred to as X4B-1s, impressed by the initial test results and enthusiastic picture, the Navy ordered full scale evaluation trials for both X4B-1s.

The Army test after belt had the new Boeing fighter during the Navy tests at Anaccia. Army pass sent some pilots from Rolling Field to Anaccia to watch the Navy tests and shake down the Model 89 are time period. Again the points climax were very enthusiastic and the Army ordered twelve of the diminuing Boeing planes 7 November 1928, designating the new aircraft as the p-12. The only difference between the P-12 and the X4B-1 was detection of the Navy-required equipment such as the carrier arreting gear. Both the production of the Navy-required and the P-12 had gratings behind each cylinder head in an attempt to streamline the engine shape.

Full scale tests by the Navy revealed many minor problems that pilots noted for change. There were the usual fuel and oil leaks, and the X4B-1 suffered from a bad engine which was quickly replaced. The Navy eroded for the split-net landing gear arrangement which had the Army version of the Model 89 was designed-P-12 and made its first flight on 11 April 1928. The P-12 was dematified to production Navy F4B-1s with the arresting gear and other naval equipment removed. Army color scheme was Olive Draba with Yellow wings and tall surfaces. (AFH)

The P-12/F48-1 eccept was Spartan but well laid out. The left side of the eccept has the throttle quadrant and fuel tank selector switch mounted on the eccept wall. The box next to the pipette seat is a metal metal emase. Some of the visible instruments include the tachometer, clock, altimeter and some of the engine instruments. (AFM)
The Model 89 (74B-1) was capable of carrying one 500 pound bomb under the fuselage and ten 25 pound bombs, five under each wing. The aircraft was fitted with a cold weather engine caricanaes cover and the cylinder heads are fitted in an attempt to reduce drag-(Boeling)

This Fighting Five F4B-1 was assigned aboard USS RANGER and had a Willow Green tail assembly. There are cooling holes in the engine cow where the cylinder head flings were formerly fitted. The stains on the auxiliary fuel tank was caused by fuel leak, which were common with these tanks. (Jeff Eineti)

This P-12B is assigned to the 42rd School Squadron at Kelly Field, Texas during 1932. The pristine Olive Drah and Yellow paint scheme is indicative of the price at Kelly Field. The aircraft was fitted with navigational lights on the winglets and tail. (Robert F. Dorr)

## Appendix P-12C

The P-12C was the first of the P-12 series to incorporate the Towned engine cow rifg on production aircraft. The P-12C also had the cross-cube, spreader-bar landing gear arrangement found on the Model 83 prototype. Navigation lights were added to the wingting for night formation flying. Power came from the improved Part & Whitney R-1340-9 engine, which was still met at only 450 bp but now offering that power at altitudes up to 8,000 feet. Army ordered one hundred thirty six P-12Cs on 2 June 1930, but only completed ninety six as actual P-12Cs. The first flight for the P-12C came on 30 January 1931.

### F4b-2

The F4B-2 was the Navy equivalent to the P-12C. It had the Frise airleons on the upper wing, incorporated the cowling ring around the cylinder heads, and had both the cross axle finding gear at re-designed elevators found on the Army variants. The F4B-2 was the first variant to have a tail wheel assembly in place of the tall skids found on all Army variants. The F4B-2 was equipped with an arrestor book and had the rear fuselage reinforced for aircraft traffic lights. The engine was then run & Whitney R-1340-8 rated at 500 bp. The Navy ordered forty-six P-28, with deficius connecting on 2 January 1931. The first unit operation in the F4B-2 was VF-5B aboard USESington, with VF-6B on US Sarague being the second. Later in their script lives, the crushing F4B-2 were retrofitted with the much larger vertical wall surfaces as found on the F4B-4.

The P-12C was fitted with the Towned cow ring during production and had the split-safe landing gear used on the P-12P-12B replaced with a "spreader-bar" axle. The first flight of a production P-12C took place on 30 January 1931. (Jack Binder)

Although it looks for more complicated than the nine V-12 engines it replaced, the air-cooled radial engine was easier to maintain. This was the main reason it was adopted by flyer for its carrier aircraft. (APM)

This was the main reason it was adopted by flyer for its carrier aircraft. (APM)

**P-12D**

Of the remaining forty aircraft on the original P-12B contract, thirty-five were completed as P-12Ds. Generally identical to the P-12C, the changes were all internal between the P-12C and P-12D. The P-12D was powered by a new Pratt & Whitney R-1340-17 Way radial need at 525-15p.

Additionally, there were numerous instrument and internal equipment changes between the P-12C and P-12D; including moving the ignition wiring harness from the rear of the engine to the front. The first flight of a P-12D occurred on 2 March 1931. As with the earlier P-12B, P-12Cs and P-12Ds were later retrofitted with the larger P-12F vertical air surface.

One P-12D was equipped with the experimental XGISR-1340E guard radial engine and designated as the XP-12H. After completing tests with the new engine, the XP-12H was later converted back to P-12D standards and put into squadron service.

**(Highly A P-120 on the ramp at Charlotte Field during 1935. Chametic Field was the home for one of the Army Corps' advanced flying schools and this P-12D had a Light Blue fuselage in accordance with 1934 Army regulations for tactical aircraft. (Bob Espoable)**P- 12E/F/K

Although the P-12E "appears" to look radically different from any previous variant of the P-12 series, it is in fact basically the exact same aircraft. The P-12E was the production version of the Boeing Model 218. The Model 218 was a Boeing-funded program to get a metal skin on the P-12 airframe. There were several changes that went along with the all-metal, non-cooperose fughe that created a totally way "appearance" to the aircraft.

A rubber bar was added to the fuseling family just behind the cockp area which was then fared into the upper fuseling wing. This firing also housed the floating gear previous by found in a compartment in the upper wing. The vertical wall surfaces were increased in height and had a much smoother, rounded fanform. Both these new features created the appearance of a much shorter, totally away aircraft. In fact, the Model 218 was exactly the same as being a P-12E/GR-B, namely, for each free infuchs. The power plant remained the same Part A Whitney R-1340-713P was read out 500 h to 8.000 feet.

Tests of the Model 218 proved quite satisfactory to the Army and an order for 135 P-12E aircraft was issued on 3 March 1931. The prototype Model 218, Army designation XP-925, was sold to China, where distinguished itself in combat. The aircraft was used by Robert Short to absorb down two funges fibers compared before being shot down himself. The first flight of a production P-12E lobe space in 15 October 1931. The external appearance was again observed with the addition of the so-called "Pananna Kit Conversion." The Army pilots at France Field in the Panama Canal Zone spent many hours flying over both the Atlantic and Pacific Decians - all without benefit of a tilt in case of an emergency over the ocean. The Army and Boeing remedies this by extending the rollover bar farring straightly **F.**

The XP-120 was a standard P-12B airframe equipped with a turbo-superchraped Pratt **A Whitney** YPSR-1340G engine and Townsend cowf ring, both of which helped raise the top speed to over 190 mph. (APM)

The XP-12E rolled out from the Boeing plant on 1 October 1931. Although it appears to the dramatically redesigned from all previous models, the P-12E actually differed only in having a "rollover faning" on top the fuseling spine and an enlarged vertical tail, (Robert F. Oort)

back almost to the vertical tall surfaces. Within the larger firing was a compartment for a one man line left.

Although the Army colored 135 P-12ES, only 110 were built as P-12E. And several of that number were modified to other values. One afirm had a Pratt & Whitney R-1340-23 engine and 4575 by under the designation P-12E. This was either affine plus the XP-12E and five standard P-12E, were later modified by the hyraic P-8 Whitney R-1340-17 engine fitted with the experimental Type G2E field injection system. These aircraft were all designated as XP-12E. One of the XP-12E was under modified with XP 776W-temperatureger and designated as the XP-12A.12A to 1938; however, at the XP-12E had been brought back to standard P-12E specifications and placed in regular Army series.

The last twenty five-affumes of the original P-12E production contact were completed as P-12E. These differed from the P-12E living on the Pratt & Whitney R-1340-19 engine, which developed 600 hcp on takedoff and 500 hcp in 1,1000 feet, rather than a 8,000 feet as on the P-12E. One of the changes with the new engine was replacement of the individual exhaust stacks with an exhaust collector fire fire. The RT-12E and a schedule will label in place of the carotting at said found on previous varnings. The Army-however, retrofitted the tail wheel assembly and the exhaust collector fire to all P-12E and P-12E aircraft still in the inventory. The last P-12E was fitted with a full cockp enclosure with a sliding canopy. The P-12E series was the last bitplane in major service in the U.S. Army. But the open cockp pursuit plane would remain the standard at least through the next generation of fighter aircraft - the Boeing P-26.

# F4b-3

The F4b-3 was the Navy production variant based on the Army P-12E. The F4b-3 had the all-metal, monocouge fuselage with the taller, redesigned vertical tilt surfaces, and the roller for behind the cockpit. The lifting over the roller for the F4b-3; however, was more rounded in shape than the one on the Army P-12E. The F4b-3 was equipped with the steerable tilt wheel and had the rear fuselage reinforced and equipped with an arnerner box for aircraft carrier operations. Aircraft failed for the U.S.Marine at any time, however with our steering gear, although it could be reinstated at any time. One 23 April 1931, the U.S. Navy operated a load of 127 March 2023 airframes (F4b-3) from Booking. Only twenty-one, however, were completed as F4b-3. Fourteen were completed as Model 256, in export version of the F4b-3 for use by the Brazilian Air Force. Delivers of the F4b-3 depart in late 1931 when V5-1B natural USS SARATOG as accepted first aircraft.

## F4b-4

The F4b-4 was identical to the F4b-3 with the exception of the vertical tail surfaces and roller for fairing. The vertical tail surfaces were greatly enlarged to improve directional stability and control. The headset and rollover bar were enlarged, as was the fairing over the

The cockpit of the P-12E/F4B-3 was very simple with the flight instruments grouped in the center and engine instrument on the lower panel. The instrument panel has a Black leather padded cover, while the rest of the cockpit was Natural Metal. The gun charging handles are visible on either side of the instrument panel. The large gledge below the instrument panel can be the raoder petals. The circular Black switch below the throtile is the fuel selector panel. (**A**r**)

The last of twenty-five P-12F's (serial 32-101) was modified at Boeing with a sliding glass canopy and clear panels behind the coboid for rearward vision. Although ahead of its time and not put into service, this aircraft foredied of things to come and within a few years all fighter aircraft would be so equipped. (AFM)

When the government sold the two F4B-4s, Jesse Infistow bought both aircraft and new Item in aerial demonstrations. The modified aircraft were powered by 600 hpraft & Whitney Wasp engines. One crashed in 1948 and was destroyed, while the other aircraft was restored and now resides in the National Air & Space Museum. (Warner Roblo)

This Boeing Model 100A, NC 247K, was specifically designed and built for Howard Hughes. Hughes then completely redesigned and rebuilt the aircraft with a latter vertical tail, full NACE engine cowling and wheel pants. This was the only P-12 in civilian hands while the aircraft was still in military service. (Robo Esposito)
