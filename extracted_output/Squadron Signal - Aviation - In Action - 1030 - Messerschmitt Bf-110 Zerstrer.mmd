## Appendix B If 110B

By March 1938 BFW had begun series production of a refined version of the Zerfetter. The nose section had been redesigned into more aerophynamically releasing lines and a pair of 20mm MG FF common were added fixing through openings in the lower portion of the new nose.

Unfortunately, by the time the airlines had reached an advanced stage in construction the BB604 engines had still not been certified for installation so it was decided that an up-powered version of the Jumo engine would continued to be used. In April the first preproduction of 110B-08 took to the air powered by a pair of Jumo 210B engines of 700 h.p. each. In July 1938 the first production of 110B-18 began to roll off the assembly line. The Luffuffar took the unit of the French Chief of Air Staff, General Vulilemin, during August, as an opportunity to unveil their new twin engine aircraft. The General was conducted to August where he was allowed to witness a fire-power demonstration and the production lines of the Zerfetter. BT 110B-18 were seen to role off the assembly line at regular intervals and fly away. When the French Chief of Air Staff did not know was that the reproduction BT 110B-Os and the few BT-110B-18 were being rolled out and from away only to land out of sight and be rolled off the assembly line again.

Only some 45 machines were produced, before production of the Jumo powered aircraft was terminated, (Zerfetter) /L61, a training Gmpe, was issued some of them, as well as 1/2G (formerly J414) and 1/2G 76 (formerly J110B 132) which placed them in a training station.

Development of the B series was as follows:

if 110B-2 Zerfetter, carried the full forward firing armament, four 7.92mm machine quas, a pair of 20mm MG FF antennas.

if 110B-2 Reconnaissance version with the same neuron removed and a camera installed.

if 110B-3 Trainer with the common removed and additional radio equipment installed. A number of B-18 were modified to this standard.

if 110B-1

Nose

(Above Right) The B-1 introduced a completely redesigned nose through which two of the four 7.9 mm MG 17 machine quas now protruded. The lower portion of the nose now mounted a pair of 20 mm MG FF common whose blast tube opening can just be seen at the bottom of the nose. (Smithsonian Institution)

(Right) The shaping radiators are the most identifiable feature of the BT 110B. The B series remained standard with the Zerfiersferendum until well into 1941.

During the winter of 1938-36 RI 1108-18 were issued to 1/22 1 and 1/22 76, forming a Zerstoreschutzsfield in each Gruppe. The training and development Geschwander LG 1 also received the B-1 forming [Z]/LG 1. The above machines belong to 1/20 76 [Gustav Tham]

[Above Right] Not only did the Zerstoreschulen train aticrew but they also trained ground crew. These Softwarezmenmenmen [Black Men], named for their black coveralls, are seen changing a burst tire at Nancy during 1941. Hans Sebepund]

Most of the surviving BI 110B aircraft were eventually passed to Zerstoreschulen where they were modified to the B-3 standard-cannon ammanment removed and additional radio equipment installed. (Hans Sebeprand)

The period immediately prior to the invasion of Poland was spent converting single engine flighter Gruppion to the new twin engine machines and training the air crew to fly them. This route _Zerstor_ pilot [left] double checks his map coordinate with his gunner before a cross-country training flight.

The Bf 110 in Combat: Poland

On 1 September Operation White, the Invasion of Poland, began and G6Ging's elite Zersdorfer units were in the thick of fighting from the beginning: (2/1/6.1 and 1/2/6.1 were assigned to Arithmetic 1 (Kessessling) along the Polish-East Prussian border and 1/2/6.7 was in the south with Littlettote 4 (L0/n) along the Polish-Escherichia border.

If many be that I,Z,Bf 2,Bf 3 and the honor of being the first Zersdorfer unit to cross the Polish Frontier, Wolfgang Fack, a young Oberstuant- and Staffkehgani of 2/2.26 % of the time, retizes "We had been prefided to takeoff at 60-00 and resort the 11% of KQ to 4 taxkow. In our enthusiasm someone suggested that maybe we should take off early in order to steal an hour of combat on the other Zersdorfer." A suggestion was all it took as each pilot faced for his machine in order not to be left behind: "Unfortunately" would be that for most bumps until we got over Krakow, happily there was nothing to protect them from, not even fast, just a few little white clouds. After the bumps unloaded we accepted from back to the frontier." As I regard the frontier could see all times burning and finally let that a way had begun. Since our fuel was getting low we turned toward our airfield leaving the bumbers behind. As we banted away from the Heinkels I looked down and there was a Heinkel 40 army reconnaissance aircraft looking very loosely down there with no protection. I doow down to scoct him saying about to myself, look, we are here, you can do you join to under our wings: "All of a sudden be saw the same and started to waste and turn the lazy and the guare blazeed away at me. Pulling away 1 realized had just gotten my medium of fire from one of our warm aircraft. A few minutes later 1 saw another aircraft flying." But a PE2.1 %, I cant start by some." A lotted gain some height he cured into the sun and he did it caught a glimpse of red on his wing - Tm sure he's a Polish aircraft now. We had been briefed that the normal red and white box is bargling and the white overhanged with camouflage leaving only the red visible. As I turned into him 1 opened fire, but fortunately, my marshship was better than the reconnaissance guare's had been, as he banted to get away 1 saw it as a Stuka. I then realized that what I had thought was a red Polish mission was actually a red E. I reported this immediately after landing and before long the colored letters on wings of our aircraft were organized in black." Fack and 1/2/6 % remained softens on the first day.

In the Northern Sector, the Bf 110 equipped 2/1/6.1 is decorated He 111Bs of KQ 22 animals Warsaw. As the HeinkensI prepared to drop their bombs, thirty B2. 11Cts of the Pawlikowski's Pursuit triangle rose to give battle, within minutes the Zerdorfer had blown for the timeline Polish Identifiers out of the air without a loss to themselves. The Bf 110 had drawn its first blood.

On the second day 1/2/6.7 net a number of PLE 13 over L04 with the Neutral Heliumtent and Oberstuant Nagel shooting down one each. The Polish pilots, however, were able to shoot down three of the Zerdorfer.

Organized activity on the part of the Polish Air Force diminished very quickly with most of their number being destroyed on the ground and the Zersterber began to carry out ground attack and strike missions. Occasion enemy air activity was encountered. Oberstuant Wolfgang Fack, credited with three kills during the Polish Campaign, described his first kill:

Battle of Heligoland Bight

After the Polish Campaign, 1/1/26 76 transformed to the Rhine area flying patrols along the Franco-German border, on 17 December this crack Zerstor unit was posted to Jewer to reinforce "Komomando Schumacher" in the face of increased RAF activity in the Heligoland Bight area. The next day twenty-two Wulfings of No. 3, 37 and 149 seasons carried out at "armed reconnaissance". The RAF force was picked up by Freya radar while still far out to sea. "Komando Schumacher" built up with five 610s and sixteen BI 110s in the air. Only by Williams returned to England and of the 12 lost, nine were claimed to be the fit 110s of 12/6.8.

StirfulRigularink Falck and his wing man were on patrol north west of Borkum at par for the nation of Taxel. "We flew in the direction of Heigoland and when we sighted the enemy we began climbing. The bombers were quite a distance away and we could see animal profits of smoke as flak burst over Wiltenhausen as the tomines turned toward England." During to the attack Falck got one Wellington and his wing man, Feldweber freya, got two before they had to break off their attack when Falck's machine took his from the tail turned out a Wellington. "With the windings stopped, 1 jelled to the airfield on Wangtenoge island - it was the first and last time that I was a glider pilot".

Meanwhile on the southwest coast at Stawanger-Sola airfield quite the reverse had been going on. The Fallschimizinger of 3.7/_F8B_ 1 had dropped nearly on time after being slowed by weather conditions but their air support, the BT 110s of 3.72G 76 under Obit. Gollob, had encountered such adverse weather that all but two aircraft had been forced to turn back. In the face of heavy ground fire and without air cover the partrooms had jumped onto Sola airfield. As the partrooms began trying to collect themselves under whitening defensive fire two Zeroser of 3.72G 76 seemed across the airfield with their tens and cannot blazing, scattering the Norwegian defenders, giving the Fallschimizinger time to organize their attack. After a half-hour of heavy fighting the airfield was in German hands and the BT 110s lead, with the 3u S2S carrying reinforcements right behind them.

Berlin had hoped that Norway would lay down its arms as the Danes had done, but this was not to be the case, heavy fighting continued and on the 13th a hastity put together British Expeditionary Force landed. Heavy ground fighting continued for over a month but most of the German air units including the Zerstraer were quickly withdrawn and deployed along the Franco-German border. The Scandiavian campaign cost the Luftawfte just over twenty BT 110s.

B1110C-2, C-3 and C-4

Operations and technology dictated changes and improvements in the Bif 110s in order to make the Zerferer more effective and versatile in combat. The C-2, already in service during the Norwegian campaign, different from the C-4 only by having the improved Fud to 10. Before the invasion of France began the Bif 1100C-3 with an improved MR FF- lacking the external breedring-beam rolling off the assembly line. Very quickly the C-3 gave way to C-4 which for the first time provided other printed protection for the crew. Going into production at the beginning of the offensive in the West. The C-4 did not arrive at the front in substantial numbers until the Battle of Britain began.

## Offensive in the West

The German war plan for the subjugation of the West called for a breakthrough in the Ardenes between Namur and Montmely and then a wide armored sweep towards the Channel coast at the mouth of the Somme. It this was to be carried out the northern flank, Holland and Belgium, had to be secured from British and French using. As in previous operations the Zerferergreen were called upon to clear the aid of enemy fighters and to carry out airlines deep behind enemy lines as well as to escort bomter formations.

At dawn on May 1940 the "Sitzitzky" was over a fewn the German armed forces launched their massive assault against France and the Low Countries. ZG 1 and ZG 26 were assigned to Luffflette 2 (Kesselfient) operating in support of Army Group 5 in Mission of Holland and Belgium and ZG 26 was assigned to Lfuttite 3 (Sperant) operating in support of the Army Group A whose task was to strike through Luxembourg and southern Belgium into France. 12/13 was transferred to Kirchhoff in anticipation of the attack on the low countries. As Fake explains it:

One day Kissening one year, we were sitting and taking about the possibility of an attack against the West when he gave me our orders. Our Gugwe was to attack and destroy aircraft on articles in Holland. It did not against a Dutch airlined on an island in the mouth of the Bron River. Since this was not quite light at 05% to the took off one at a time on the way during landing it is torn to win. He first at about 200 meters in order to be above meaning gun and small serns fine-free was on question about a right bis time, we were not going to be welcomed as liberators. As we approached our target as was built but we could see that the airlined was covered with all sorts of obstacles, trucks, old cars and then buses were scattered over the field effectively breathing any featurant aircraft from landing. And in the middle of the first time, the airlined was scattered over the field of the first time. The second time was scattered over the field of the second time. The second time was scattered over the field of the second time. The second time was scattered over the field of the second time. The second time was scattered over the field of the second time. The third time was scattered over the field of the second time.

After five days of heavy fighting the Dutch Armed Forces capititated and 1/20A 1 was spent south to join the battle of France.

In the South, 1/20A 76 had been lying too deep and strike missions in support of Army Group 4's advance through Belgium and Luxembourg. Artifacts were so crowded that for the first three days 1/20A 76 had to stage from Kö/Bonn anircled to Eisenborn, refuel and then try little, usually not arriving over the front lines before 9000. On the second day of the invasion, 12 May, Leutnant Hans-Joachim Jahs of 6,12G 76 was flying a strike mission in support of 4. Panzer Division when he got his first kill:Your first girl you never forget and so it is quite the same with your first victory. We were about 350 meters above the Horness at Namur in Belgium. It was good weather, not even any clouds. Of a sudden our Gurpour Commander, Haugmann Groft, goes down in a steep office.

My My four making and twin clouds has its toll: he begins to burn his as a false map for left one and goes down. Meanwhile around just when he crash in the ground. I got my first kill. The next day 1 got a Morone and in such the 15th day I stayed too Moranes. We no longer stage from Kim from to Eleison, but we begin to ho across the French course so right behind the Panners, from one grassway to another. We allotrays, just chance headings. In looking for my fifth that will. It is a decent scene. We're also got the French Ar Force and the Weatherham has seven their bases. Everytime we see them her scatter.

With the French Ar Force orthopedic, the multivariate was now thrown almost completely into the tactical support of the advancing ground forces, although a constant effort was made to complete the destruction of the French and English Air Forces in France by continually carrying out low level surprise attacks. By the 20th the Germans had formed a Higheland across the Somme and then swaps north taking Bouzoup and encircling Calais on the 20th. The British Expedition's Forces were effectively enriched. On 28 May the British had begun falling back toward Durinklers as the German armed forces tightened the nodes around them. But in order to observe his armor for later operations, von Rundtled Groft created the Panners to halt their advance. The multivariate was at the same time ordered to 3 step up that attack. Going boosted that he could destroy the British forces at Dumkirk from the air and prevent their being evacuated. On the 29th of May, Lujtman Hans-Joachim also, having remained secretless since his hit victory on the 15th, was with his staffed our Dunkirk.

Few range and over the city, our Stukas and Heinkles were really pounding it. Two confenders and 1 had lost some through a huge cloud of only smoke when all of a wooden agent Solutes are in front of our Stukas. Our of it reflects it in my third buttons and to meet them go down. One of the Montanies his the parachue but I'd not only took the other path out before his animal in the ground. I had out only 17th or 18th, respectively, so we will not have to wait. In the next day, we just chance the next day. The other two, the other two, the other two, the other two, the other two.

I just met the Sunrise as began taking large losses. We were too slow and not measure enough. When we encountered splittings, we mostly turn into a sub and attack, one after the other, time that eight neighboring ones and then tell over as and then turn and one bear at all again. They were less and our cockups were without armor protection. During the Battle of Fame out Gruppe took 64 minutes, but it is neither of them were to be Sotifling ever Dunkers.

The action over Dunkirk did much to make the confidence that the Zerstorte is that he might fly. In fact there the Lujtman's title had come up against large numbers of Splitres and Hurtzes when the RAF put up a maximum effort to provide an air umbrella over their evacuation. Heef, By a June the British had evacuated 338.22 new matching 120,000 French troops. In the four days from 27 May to 30 May Britain fighters claimed 179 Lujttaffe aircraft for a loss of only 29 fighters.

Bf 110D Long Range Zerstorer

The fighting in Norway and in particular the experiences of 1/26 76 had revealed the need for increasing the operational range of the fBf 110, this coupled with the need to resort shipping in the North Sea against British air attack game the development of a laquestrecen (long range) Zerstorer the highest priority. A 264 mm- plan, geldly tank was found to the fBf 110. Fabrication from improved and covered with fabric the tank in theory was to be dropped immediately after its contents were used up or enemy contact was made. First issued to 2.4 m, 3/26 76 short to use in the North Sea has different began losing aircraft in unexplained circumstances. It was later learned that even though the fuel was used up the tank was filled with highly volatile fumes and the tank had a tendency to hang up in low temperatures and sometimes explode.

Bf 110D-O Prototype - using Bf 110D-3 air frames several machines were adopted to accept the 246 m, Geldly tank in order to carry out service trials.

Bf 110D-I/R-1 Langstrecken Zerstorer - production version of the Langstrecen Zerstorer which shared the assembly into with the C series, the belly tank modification being made during final assembly.

Bf 110D-I/R2 Langstrecken Zerstorer - when the cause of the losses of the gf 110D-I/R1 aircraft was attributed to the belly tank provisions were made for a pair of 198 mple, gal drop the number of outages.

Bf 110D-Z Langstrecken Zerstorer - could carry a pair of 66 mple, gal, retouching drops under the wings and mounted in Arc 500 bomb rock for carrying two 1, 102 b, bombs.

Bf 110D-3 Langstrecken Zerstorer - was capable of carrying either a pair of 66 mple, gal drop tanks or a pair of 198 mple, gal drop tanks, in addition the tail of the fuelabise was heightened to provide space for a rubber dump. An Et 500 bomb rack was optional.

Since a good deal of the area south of the Glouesester-London line was beyond the range of the BF 109, the BF 110s would be used extensively to escort and protect the bomber formations. The attack plan called for the Zersterror to use their endurance to lead the attack bumping up and engaging the defenders until they had exhausted their fuel. As the British single engine machines were landing to rearm and reulet, the bombers with another flight of protective BF 110s would arrive and attack the airfields now covered with helpless fighters. A plan designed to cripple the RAF during the first major encounter.

Unfortunately for the plan, the BF 110s were nearly incapable of defending themselves against the Hurtemes and Spitters. When this type of rail was carried out, the initial Zerstor were routed, those not shots down or heavily damaged were sent feeding to the coast. The second wave Bt 110s flying exort with the bombers then found themselves forced into a defensive vehicle long before the bombers had reached their target. Before long BF 100s had to be assigned to protect the Zerstor as well as the bombers.

Sporadic raids had been carried out against targets in the Channel and on ports throughout the month of July and early August. On the 6 August Gomity called his Generalist together to outline his plan, "Ademferr" (Attracts of the Eagles), for the air offensive against the RAF. The opening attack, under the code name Adeltering (Eagle Day), was to be a massed attack against RAF bases on 10 August. In fact the weather turned bad and remained so on the 10th and 11th postponing Adeltering until the 13th. Monday 12 August dawned bright and clear. Probing the British defense during the previous month had demonstrated the effectiveness of the British radar system. So the experimental 240 unit, E.G.210, was assigned the task of destroying all known radar stations between Portland and the Thames Estuary. With 561 lb. bombs sung beneath their fuelage Hauptmann Walter Hubenschiffel is the Gnupen and, 2. Battle equipped with with 11054-/48 and 3. Staff acquired equipped with 1902-4/8 to the coast of an island where they split to attack their individual targets. Although in each case the attacks were brilliantly executed all of the stations except one were back in operation within a few hours. After e.G.210 returned to report the success of their mission a force consisting of nearly a hundred 488 % of KG 51 protected by the hundred and twenty of 110s of 22 and 20s of 20s and twenty-five BF 108les of 34 S3 lookout. Not picked up on road until the raiding force was nearing their targets. Portsmouth and Ventor on the site of Wright were heavily bonded, 10, 488 being his fifth.

Shortly after the KG 51 grid, E.G.210 served across Mansion airfield starting and bombing. Lasting only a few minutes, the attackers let the British air field looking like what they thought was a orange of burning wroakage. In fact the Spitters of 55 Squadron were only slightly damaged and one of the BF 110s was short down by a Spitters of 54 Squadron. Five Bt 110s were lost on this day.

#### 13 August - Adeltering

At 0500, 74 Do 17s of KG 2 headed for the French coast where they were to meet their escort, sixty BT 110s of 267 Be. Unbeknownst to the bombers the taxi had been cancelled because of weather that their protective fighters had been recalled. Five Dorners were shot down and five were damaged. Shortly before none, 1/26, 2 now led by Buindmann Heiline since Major Ott was shot down and killed by a Spitters of 600 Squadron. A few days before, took off. This raid also had been postponed due to weather but ZG 2 had not been informed. Not meeting their bomers the Zerstor pushed out to Portland where they tangled with Spitters losing one aircraft. The first reply by radio card during the middle of the afternoon when thirty Zerstor of V(2)/1/G 1 secoring 120 Ju 88s were part of a larger attacking force. V(2)/1/G 1 lost four BT 110s out of a total of fourteen Zerstor lost on Adlertag. The day was something less than a success and provided a fleeting glimpse of the disaster that was just two days away.

_15 August - Black Thursday_

The next day, E.G.2108 _if_ 110C-4/8 gain struck at Manston losing two machines to ground fire. After the fiasco of Adlertag and a relatively quiet day on the 14th, the Zerstor were in heavy combat on the 15th. In the North, Littleftte 5 launched its first large scale attack from Norway and Denmark, Veny-one Daekbaechal (Daschuhl-ly equipped) of 1100-11/8 in/12/6 76 based at Aldorg met their charges, served in 111 s/11 and I/K3 26 from Stansor, over the North Sea. Hopting that the heavy attacks in the South had tied up most of the fighters, the RAF bases of Daschuhl and Linton-Ou-Ou waste were to be attacked. Unknown to German intelligence, a strong reserve of fighters had been kept in the North for just such an event. A 1436, while the rasters will still lose twenty-five miles out to sea, the radar directed Splitters of 70.25 Squadron attacked out of the sun. The first glance to hit was the machine belonging to ZG 76s Gruppenkmondner, Hauptman Restemeyer, which exploited when unreleased Daekbaechal was penetrated, and seconds later, the Gruppe adjustments aircraft was seen to go down as did a Heinkink. A rule of individual airettes took base as the Largestor Zerstor simply tried to defend the bombers and rebuild up fighting for their own existence. Fine minutes later, the rasters of 100 Seatonod door to the attack. After losing nearly a third of their number, 12, 76 was forced to flee for Denmark, leaving the bombers to their own devices. After taking such heavy losses, Littleftte 5 never again launched a large scale radi, and in September, 1/2/6 78 was withdrawn from the Battle and retrained as a night fighter unit.

Meanwhile in the south, 16 g/11s and fit 1908s of E.G.2104 attacked Martismann in a low level rail flat knocked the airfield out to nearly two days. At about 1730, for 110s of ZG 2 securities sixty 48 B8s of L 1 were introduced by four seasons of British fighters. Downing on 161 10, the intercepts were able to force their way to the bombers, knocking down eight of them, at 1820, Ruhenstorder again had his E.G.210 to the attack, thus the main against Raftery. Having missed his 61 post (see attack was pursued anyway, in the event against Raftery Corpoia due to an _error_ in navigation. As before under Rubenstorder, the attack was a success, destroying a number of buildings including a factory engaged in the repair of furnics. A.E.G.2108 drove of their tail furanessured in on them. Initially going into a defensive circle, the BT 110s suddenly broke for cloud cover. As they did, the Skin flight came under attack and Rubenstorder's aircraft went down following smoke. Including their Romanander, E.G.2108 said six 110s and fit 190s. Other actions over England cost 11/2/6 76 faith stratosphere, eight BT 110s and in/2/6 76 lost three. Of the 83 odd damages lost by the Lurfuffee on this day twenty-six (31%) were from the Zerstorperpower.

On Friday the 15th, the Zerstorperpower lost an additional eight machines, half of them from 26 76. Almost no stories were from on the 17th despite good weather. The 18th of August, however, again brought the Lurfuffee to the attack and it was the turn of 26 26 to get observed up, losing fourteen machines in a single day. By now it was becoming increasingly obvious that the BT 110 could not hold its own in combat with the British single seat fighters. At a meeting on the 19th, however, Goring would listen to no criticism of his Bf 110, blaming instead the leadership of some of his senior commanders or the incompleteness of the pilots. He did issue orders that henceforth Bf 10s were to be defeated to fly close escort for the Zerstorperpower. Even so it was not until the 25th that the BT 110s returned to the battle, with 1 and 1/2/6 2, and 1/2/6 1 encoding I/K3 5 and 1/1/K3 5 at an attack against Portland, Weymouth and Warmwell. Despite the presence of Bf 10s from "Fik", ZG 2 lost six machines and 1/2/6 1 lost two. On 25th, A group, two machines were lost despite the fact over 100 8th 110s were put over England. The 25th saw sixty 110s were carried without a loss. The BT 110s goes west saying off. On the afternoon of the 25th, 500 8th 100s and 150 8th 110s recorded a small number of bombers hoping to create Fighter Command up to fight. The plow went without results.

During the month of August over 120 BF 110s were lost and it had now become obvious, even to Goring, that the Zerstorper could not hold its own against the himeh British fighters. Unfortunately, because of a shortage of single engine machines the Zerstorperpower could not be withdrawn from the battle but their role was curtailed.

### **Spipheripher**

Monday, 2 September, saw nine Zerstor lost, four from ZG 2, three from ZG 26 and two from ZG 76. On 3 September 80 BF 110s of ZG 2 and 2/6

## Africa

In North Africa, things were also going badly for the Italians who were in full retreat in the face of a smaller British force. Visualizing British control of all Africa, Hiltler decided to dispatch forces to prop up Missouri's troops, at least enough to keep them from collapsing. The first unit to arrive was the I/I 110 equipped ill./Z62 so, which was reinforced by 2. Staffel, arriving on 30 January 194 and immediately dispersed to airfields at Castel Bentle, Sire and Arco Pilanorum. Going into action quickly, the Zerstorte unit had lost six aircraft by the end of February while only having shot down two enemy machines.

At the end of March, Rommel struck, leading his forces against British lines forcing them to withdraw and beginning a retreat that would not stop until Romero's forces were threatening Egypt itself. Flying against Hurticanes and Tomahahaws over the open expenses of the desert where their range stood them well, the B1 toks taired much better than they had against the RAF during missions across the Channel; through the end of August 1941, ill./Z62 claimed some 33 enemy aircraft for a loss of only 23 Zerstorte.

Commander, Lieutenant-General Kopetis, committed suicide on the second Gay when he had already lost 600 aircraft and could only claim 12 German aircraft. Since most of the Zerosor equipped Gruppement that survived the Battle of Britain were either in North Africa with Roommel or undergoing night tighter conversion in order to combat the increasing RAF HIP trials on Germany, only the 11 oil equipped Schneelmannlefs underwater 210 (SKG 210) and 11/26 28 were available for Barbrossa.

Attached to Littlefite 2 supporting Army Group Center, the BT 110s while small in number, initially only gone 60 aircraft, struck Soviet airfases in low level attacks. Finding the Russian airfails covered with aircraft parked in peacetime rows without camoufage, the Zerosor's streaked across their assigned airfails bombing and starting everything in a night leaving behind little but burning hulks. The Luffuffrate attached 33 airfails in the first wave, destroying hundreds of enemy machines and losing only two aircraft. The damage went on hour after hour, so after day, complete air units were destroyed in the ground and the few Red machines that did get into the air were quickly dispated. Because most of the destruction took place on the ground, however, comparatively few aircraft were lost, leaving the Sories a large pool of personnel with which to begin neighbouring. After the first few weeks the Soviet Air Force could offer only feeble resistance and the BT 110s were able to go over to the low level attack role, carrying out starling and bombing attacks on front lines, roads and railway lines. By at July, 23.26 had put in China for 620 aircraft destroyed in low level attacks and aerial combat. On 19 August, 23.6 was originally noted for having carried out two attacks on a Soviet airfase at a living south of Leningday, destroying 15 and leaving 30 burning on the ground, and destroying 3 in the air, raising their score to 854 enemy machines including 191 in aerial combat. On 15 September, 11/26 2 participated in Operations Bewotil 1 and 1, the senoham Landings on the Battle Islands of Muhu, Saemema and Humana. Acting as flying ridwing, and the 110s carried out 118 stories losing only two machines. Between 22 June and 27 September, 62 26 was credited with having lost down 36 aircraft, destroying 741 on the ground, destroying 148 tanks, to fullyer places, 320 vehicles, 49 railroad trains, one armured train, 68 locomotive and 4 bridges.

In the Northern Sector a schawment of 11/26 28 and 1/40 77 operated fir 110s under Littlefite 5 based at Oslo, Norway. Because of weather, it was not until 25 June that operations got underway with a strike at Niva, Vartanova and Veraing airfails on which the Zerosor were able to catch the Russian aircraft, there days after the war had begun, lined up up up to giving tip. Moving into Finland in order to shorten the distance to Murmansk, raids were carried out as often as time and weather permitted, with the BI 110s also carrying out second routes for the bombers. By 12 July, Hauptmann, G. Schneelka had claimed 12 flights and by 4 August he had his 20th kil but was that down behind Russian lines. The coming of Fall however, saw the few machines of 1/26 28 being pulled from the Northern sector to undergo night fighter training, leaving only 7.2/1/4.0 5 operating twelve of 110s in Littlefite 5.

In the south, I and II SKG 210 flew ground attack in support of Operation Tallon, an enveloping attack designed to destroy Army Group Trinoshenko and open up the way to Moscow. The huge phicer movement 7.2/1.20was completed by 7. October, but the movement toward Moscow was slowed down by rain and the ensuing mode. By 13 November, however, cold had set in and the Panzer divisors were again on the move across the hardened ground toward Moscow, and by the 27th of November elements of the 3rd Panzeropting reached the Vogea giant just 19 files from the center of Moscow. Thirty coupled weather and heavy goods was fly now begun taking their toll of the Wethermatch, which was totally unp unp unperedered for the severity of the Wethermatch prior. On 5-6 December, just as the Germanos decided to go over to the defensive, the Russain struck, launching a massive counter-attack having the Germanos back from Moscow. Fighting continuous delaying actions, the Germanos finally succeeded in establishing a new, but in places critically thin, defensive line.

When production of the left 10th and hit equal exceed during the 19th, the Zerstortenegreen also told up based to exist between the 6th 10th and 11th in production during Feb. 1942. The lack of 11th production coupled with an increased demand for the twin engine fighter by the Nachiodyndischarge pored nearly disfavations for Zerstore units at the end of 19th, when they all but disappeared from Luffuffuest strength reports. From a strength high of 44th machines on 10 August 1940, their numbers had fallen to a mathematics with only 25 being serievable on 13 December 1941. The Luffuest e site had now become a stecibold, a Chotefian whose fairly godmother would turn out to be the Allied daylight bomber amrada during 1943.

During the course of 1942, with the BF 110 again in production, Zerstortenegreen was brought back up to a high of 300 machines, but monthly strength averaged only about 200 and serviceability was usually at less than half. The Zerstortenegreen were as follows at the close of 1942: 1 and 1/26 1 (formerly SKG 210) 1, and 1/10 (26 28 13.(2)/.3/.6) 5.

A number of other units carrying the Zerstortenegreen question such as 1/26 and 2/30 2 were in fact equipped with Fw 190s or Me 210 fighter bombers. Stored for aircraft, the Zerstortenegreen fared poorly during 1942, playing its most important role in North Africa where 20 26 had been the first Luffuest dramatic formation to arrive in the theater. When the British launched their massive assault at El Alamian at the end of October 1942, a 1/26 28th was over 300 miles away at Derna while 7 and 9,0/26 7 were even further, being at Kasetti on Pareto. Used mainly to protect convoys by the Mediterranean, their first loss after the beginning of the El Alamian offensive was a machin that accidentally force handed a mine in cold 3 November, the crew being killed. With German ground forces falling back, 1/26 28 was also called upon to carry out protective patrios above the retract-choked roads.

On 8 November 1942, four days after Remmel had begun his retract, Anglo-American forces began landing in French North Africa and the Luffuest began switching units from all points to the Mediterranean area to meet this new threat. 1/12/26 28 was moved to Sicily where it was used almost exclusively to select both sea and air transport and only occasionally seen over North Africa. The step-up of Allied daylight bombings during the summer of 1943 finally caused this crack Zerstorter unit to return to Germany.

Once in the air, the rocket equipped machines would climb to just above the bomber formation. The rockets could be fitted from a range of just over 6,000 feet and still be grouped 50 percent in a circle of 97 feet, with the remainder in a circle of 200 feet. Operationally, the fuses were usually set to be fired at from 1800 to 3600 feet. Weighing 248 pounds with a timely 1.wahrend this weapon was initially very effective in breaking up the closely packed 8-17 formations. When the bomber formations broke up, the Zerstuber and single engine fighters could then attack the bombers singly. (Bundesearch)
