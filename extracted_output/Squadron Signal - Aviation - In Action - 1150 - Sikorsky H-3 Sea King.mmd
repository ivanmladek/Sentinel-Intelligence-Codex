## Introduction

With its development in the 1940s, the helicopter has taken on many roles previously reserved exclusively for fungi using aircraft and no other name has been more closely associated with the term helicopter than Sikorsky.

In 1919, Igor I. Sikorsky immigrated to the United States following the Russian revolution and by 1923 he had founded the Sikorsky Arc Engineering Corporation on Long Island, New York so each would be 8-29A all metal flying boat. Prior to coming to the United States Sikorsky had worked on helicopter as well as fixed wing designs in his native Russia. Sikorsky helped many successful designs during the Great War, the First World War, mostly the S-16, a two seven reconnaissance aircraft and the 8-20, a single seat could, but were bipphens and were powered by a Gonne rotary engine.

The Sikorsky S-20A, the A standing for America, was the first of many successful flying boat designs. Sikorsky went to build the 5-36, an eight seat amphibian and the S-40, a four engined amphibian that entered service during 1931 with Pan American World Airlines. Sikorsky also built some of the world's largest flying boat during the 1930s, the S-42 and 8-43, both of which were grown by Pan American World Airlines in regular commercial general service service on the Atlantic and Pacific routes.

In 1929, the Sikorsky Aviation Company, as it was now called, moved to Stratford, Connecticut, where it would soon merge with the United Aircraft and Transport Company. When United Aircraft purchased the Voughi Airplane Company, it was merged with Sikorsky to become the Voughi-Slicorsky Airplane Company.

**igor Sikorsky pilots the Voughi-Slicorsky VS-300, the first successful helicopter design. This was Sikorsky's third design, the first two were tested in his native Russia. (Slicorsky was Ken Short)**

In 1931, Sikorsky applied to the U.S. Patent Office for a patent on a helicopter design and in 1935 it was granted. Work progressed very slowly on a flying prototype due to severe budget restrictions imposed by the parent company, United Aircraft, brought on by the great depression. In 1939, the VS-300 was rolled out of the experimental design shop. The VS-300 went through one year of testing, tethered and un-refhered flights and current may design changes to improve flight performance. The tail root went through many changes to improve directional stability. On 13 May 1940, the first truly successful flight was made that employed all of the flight characteristics of a true helicopter. Igor Sikorsky made most of the test flights himself, wearing his characteristic bowler hat.

The success of the VS-300 led to the development of the Sikorsky VS-316A, the first single rotor helicopter designed for the U.S. Army Air Corps. The VS-316A was soon designed as the XR-4 and over 130 were produced for the U.S. Army, Navy and Coast Guard. The U.S. Armed Forces early on discoverment the versatility of the R-4 and the R-4 design grew into the R-5, called the H-5 by the U.S. Army and HOGS-120S. They opened by the U.S. Navy. This helicopter soon became the benchmark for future helicopter development and use.

A succession of helicopter designs rolled off the production line at the Sikorsky Stanford plant, the H-19, designated as HOGS in U.S. Navy service, and H-3-designed a BS-1 by the U.S. Navy. The U.S. Army used the both H-19 and H-3-4 for cargo and two movement, while the U.S. Navy used them for Search and Rescue (SASA) and Anti-submarine warfare (ASW). When it became clear the flight engine could not produce the helicopter for rise and weight that the turbine engine offered, the U.S. Navy put out a Request For Proposals (RFP) for a helicopter that would replace the HSS-1 Seabat and employ the new turbine engine.

**The U.S. Navy used the HSS-18 (H-34-3) Seabat in Hunter-Killer pairs in the anti-submarine role during the late 1950s. HS-4 Black Knights (all code TA) operated in the Pacific with MS-518 until they were replaced by HS-5-2 Sea Kings in 1963. (Navy via Jim Presley)**The HSS-1 Seabat was used by the U.S. Navy as hunter/silter pairs in the anti-submarine warfare (ASW) node during the 1950s. The Navy wanted to combine the two roles into one air-frame and also to employ a turbothar gas turbine engine for greater range and performance. On 24 December 1957, the Navy contracted with Sikorsky for the development of a helicopter that could not only locate an enemy submarine, but once located, destroy it.

Skiorsky's answer to the U.S. Navy's request was their S-61 design that employed a water- and right ball, turbine engines and a five bladder main and tail rotor system. The original conceptual code of a single prototype ARM spe-production aircraft, but this filter grew to ten. The XRISS-2 prototype (BuNo 147137) made its first flight on 11 March 1959 from the Sikorsky plant at Stanford, Connecticut. The XRISS-2 was a large, for its time, helicopter with a fushegele from fifty-five feet nine inches and an annual height of sixteen feet ten inches. The XRISS-2 was powered by a pair of General Electric 1,050 SHP T-8S-GE-6 turbulent engines throw a sixty-foot diameter, five bladed main rotor through a free wheeling transmission. The XRISS-2 featured strumted sponsons on each side that served two functions, floatting and rainfings for the retractable main landing gear. The sponsons also contained inflatable emergency float bags for further stabilization in water operations. For all weather operations, the prototype was fitted with Doppler radar, a feature that was carried over to all poliod aircraft. The aircraft was also fitted with a radar at a Hammett Alamot named auto stabilization system that provided automatic transition, hands off, so a lower. XRISS-2 had a more evenly weight of 9,763 pounds and a maximum gross weight of 26,500 pounds. In a clean configuration it had to speed of 166 mph and a normal cruise speed of 13 mph. Total total capacity was 642 gallos, except in two bladder tanks. This gave the XRISS-2 a range of 5400 line. The service ceiling was 14,700 feet and the XRISS-2 could have over over of ground effect at 8,500 feet.

The Sikorsky S-61/XRISS-2 design bore a strong family resemblance to the Sikorsky S-62. The S-62 was a single engine, turbine powered aircraft that used the dynamic rotor components of the IRS-17M-34. The S-62 flight test program provided valuable flight data for the S-The first flight of the XRISS-2 Sea King (BuNo 147137) took place on 11 March 1959 from the **Skiorsky Straford**, Connecticut plant. The **XRISS-2 was the first twin turbine enginel helicopter accepted by the Navy. (Way via Jim Pressley)

61/MSS-2 program, since the S-62 had its first flight some nine months earlier than the S-61. The S-62 would later go on to serve with the U.S. Coast Guard as the HH-2S akin with some 95 earnesting being built. For rescue operations the XRISS-2 was fitted with a rescue host above the starboard fuselse cargo door. The XRISS-2 could land in the water to effect a rescue, utilizing itâ€™s watertight ball but, but the preferred method of rescue was to use the rescue host and the horse-collar slag. The rescue host contained a 300 foot length of wire cable and could host to 600 pounds.

In February 1961, after two years of flight trials at Sikorsky, the XRISS-2 prototypes, now officially called Sea Kings were flown to NAS Pataucent River, Maryland to undergo the U.S. Navy Board of Inspection and Survey (HIS) trials. While undergoing BIS trials the Gloss Navy Base XRISS-2 were redesignated as XRISS-2. The BH trials were designed to test service acceptability and were flown by the Air Test and Evaluation personnel of the Rotary Wing Aircraft Test Directorate of the Naval Air Test Center.

blades with a rotor diameter of sixty-two feet. The tail rotor boom could be folded flat against the starboard side of the fuselge for carrier storage.

The SH-3A (HS2-3) set many speed records for helicopers. In December of 1961, just three months after joining the feet, the SH-3A broke the 100, 500, and 1,000 kilometer course records with stereo 1990,1 (1000), 1828, (500), and 1795, (1000) mph respectively. In February, the SH-3A became the first helicopter to exceed 200 mph over a nineteen kilometer (source 210.6 mph). Then on 6 March 1965 a SH-3A flew non-stop across the U.S., becoming the first helicopter to accomplish this flat. Taking off from the USS HORNET (CVS-12) in San Francisco Bay that landing on the USS FRANKLIN D. ROOSEVEL ("CVA42) fire-ben hours fly-two minutes and 2,116 miles later.

The U.S. Navy experiment with the Mid-Air Retrieval System (MARS) system (MARS) on a SH-3A (Buso 147904) at NAS Point Mogan, California. The system consisted of two poles that extended from the fuselge sides, being refracted on the ground and extended below the fuselge in flight. The poles were fitted with springing hooks to snag a parcture or balloon cable, which would then be reeled up to the fuselge. To prevent the parcture or balloon from becoming entangled in the sponsons, noting was placed over the forward sponon area to guide the cable. The MARS system would be used operationally to retrieve the SAMOS (Staelliptic and Missile Observation System) weather satellite camera capsules. The MARS system would later be used by the U.S. Air Force on CH-3C and CH/HH-3E to recover drones over Southeast Asia.

The basic H-3A was built in many different version for the U.S. Armed forces. Below are listed the various variants of H-3A:

### CH-3A

The CH-3A was an amphibian cargo/transport version built for the Navy and designated as the S-61A by Sikorsky. The CH-3A cabin could accommodate up to twenty-six troops, fifteen letters or up to 8,000 pounds of cargo. Three CH-3A's (Buso 149009,149011 and 149002) were built to the Air force and re-oriented as 62- 12571-12573. They were eventually designated as CH-3B's,

### HR3S-1

This designation was given to a never built proposal that Sikorsky made to the Marine Corps. Sikorsky designated their USMC privately funded proposal as the S-61R. The HR3S-1 would have been similar to the CH-3A, but would have featured a rear loading ramp for loading cargo, personnel and vehicles. The cabin would have accommodated up to twenty-seven troops or 8,000 pounds of cargo. The S-61R/HR3S-1 design would eventually be built for the Air Force as the CH-3C.

### NH-3A

A single NH-3A was built utilizing a SH-3A airframe (Buso 148033). The fuselge was modified with a fairing over the boat hull and a streamlined rear fuselge, the landing gear sponsons were deleted and a pair of 3,000 lost Pratt and Whitney J-60-P-2 turbojet engines replaced the tubroshaft engines. Thirty-two foot span wings were added to the fuselge sides, horizontal stabilizers were added to the tail rotor pylon and the main landing gear folded upward into the jet pylon supports. The NH-3A first flew as a compound helicopter on 21 May 1965. In July of 1965 the NH-3A achieved a top speed of 242 mph with a modified rotor system that had six blades with reduced torque twist. The NH-3A was a joint Navy/Army project aimed at developing the compound helicopter to its fullest.

CHNIK 69 was the call sign of this SH-3A (Buso 148902) at HS-2, from by Lieutenant Steve Millkin when he rescued a downed pilot from Haighong Harbor, North Vietnam under enemy fire. This mission earned Millkin the Silver Star. (Captain Steve Millkin, USN, Ret.)
This SH-3A of HS-2 Golden Falcons operated off US5 HASMAN (DLG-11) as a Search and Rescue (SAR) gatechannel. The See King was camoufaged in Dark Green, Tan and Gray and was armed with two GAU-23 Minogians in the port and strubard doors. (Capitha Steve Millikon, USst, Ret.)

RH-3A

During early 1964 a contract was issued to Sikorsky to modify a SH-3A to the Mine Counter-Measure (MCM) role. In the event, a total of nine SH-3As were modified with A SH-3A of HS-2 is sworted after landing. The aircraft had previously been assigned to HS-3 and the caveant are of the feelometers in painting out the former unit's markings. The See King is in overall Engine Gray with basic networking. The only color on the aircraft is the national Ingoing. (Capitha Steve Millikon, USst, Ret.)

WH-3A

Originally designated as the HS-3Z, the VH-3A is used as a VIP transport and was flown by a joint USMC/U. S. Army unit as the President Flight. Eight CH-3As were specially equipped with gallery, air conditioning, airtime type seats, and additional radios. Due to the increased detection demands of the added equipment, an Auxiliary Power Plant (ATP) was added to the strubard sponsion. In the early 1970s, the VH-3As were modified with a ice shield/foregion object deflector toward the air intakes. The presidential flight was originally equipped with the VH-3A, but has since been upgraded to the CH-3D. Navy Helicopter Combut Support Squadron Two (HC-2) Circuit Roters, operated the Navy executive flight on the East coast. President Richard Nixon presented President Anthwar Sadit of Egypt one of the VH-3As for its personal use.

## HH-3A

As the war in Southeast Asia heated up, increased onshore bombing missions were carried out by U.S. Naval air forces. A need arose for an armed and armored Search and Rescue (SAR) helicopter to handle rescue emissions under hostile fire. As a result, twelve SH-3A3s were converted at NAS Quoanet Point, Rhode Island to the Combat SAR role. The modifications included the removal of all ASW gear and the addition of armored titanium panels in the engine transmission areas, floor and armored seats for the flight crew. The avionics and materials areas were also amored. Because of all the additional weight the engines were changed to more powerful General Electric TS-6E-GF engines and the aircraft was given provisions for the installation of 175 gallo leaf tanks mounted to the open supports.

For self-protection in hostile areas, the HH-3A was fitted with a pair of 7.62km mini-guns, one on each each of the rear fuselage. The guns were controlled by gunswe provide well-ed with bubble windows, similar to the windows fitted to the HR-3A. The gun bunternes were placed on the air toped shockles and this was found to cause an art Center of Gravity (CG) problem and they were eventually replaced by GUA-21B-7.62km mini-guns on monuts behind armored doors in the port forward and armored cargo door areas. The hand held guns were provided with 6.000 random each in 1,500 round counters. The GUA-2B/A had a firing rate of 2.000 or 4.000 rounds per minute.

The HH-3A3 originally entered service with Helicopter Combat Support Squadron Seven (HC-7) Big Mothas. The HH-3A were operated well into the 1980s, when it was replaced by SAR SH-3 Armament

### M60 Door Gun Gun

Gau-2B/A Minigun Mount

The gun was carried on the SAR variant of the SH-3A. There were two guns carried, one in the main cargo door and another in the crew entry door on the port side. Each gun had a total ammunition supply of 6,000 rounds of 7.62km ammunition. This same mount was later added to HH-3A3 when the babette mounted weapons proved unsatisfactory. (Nicholas J. Waters III)
The original HR-3A prototype (BuIo 148969) on the ramp at Skovsky. The aircraft had additional armor, two bilingual particles and two 175 gallo external fuel tanks. In service the batteries proved to be unqualty and hard to aim and were later replaced by door mounted weapons. (Sloxesty)

A total of 245-M3A systems were produced by Skovsky at the Stanford, Connecticut plant. Over 150-M3A has everse updated to the SH-3G and SH-3H standards and two SH-3As were updated to SH-3D standards. The H-3A will continue to fly well into the 21st century as the VH-3A, since it is the only helicopter in the Navy inventory of sufficient size, operating range and cost per mile efficiency to operate in the executive flight role.

A pair of SH-3As of Helicopter Combet Support Squadron Two (HC-2) come in for a landing aboard USS CONSTELLATION (CVA-64) in the Gulf of Tonkin on 17 January 1970. HC-2 saved over fifty donated arm during the Vietnam War. (May)

## CH-3B

In 1962, the U.S Air Force found it needed a helicopter with enough range and payload capacity to be able to fly out and resupply the Texas Tower radar sites located out in the Atlantic Ocean of the New England coast, as well as be able to recover drones. As a result, three U.S. Navy CH-3A (Buso 149009, 140011 and 149012) were boiled to the USAF and used by the 4756h Drone Squadron, located at Tyrolla AFB, Florida. The new CH-3As were resetated as 62-1257 Indian (62-1573). The USAF was so impressed with the range, performance and utility of the CH-3A that they requested that Skinbody build the CH-3A for use by the 551st Base Flight at Otis AFB, Massachusetts for resupply of the Texas Tower radar sites.

The new production CH-3As were realized 62-12574 through 12576 and were designated CH-3B- and corresponding to that change the first three CH-3A-save are also redesignated CH-3B-she. The CH-3B-(5-61A) had an empty weight of 97.630 pounds and a maximum loaded weight of 20.000 pounds. The CH-3B weighed less than the SH-3A since it carried no ASW equipment. The CH-3B was powered by a pair of General Electric T-58-GE-10 shaft turbine rated at 1400, 300 SHP. This gave the CH-3B a top speed, at its maximum weight, of 159 mph.

Not long after acceptance by the USAF, the number four CH-3B (62-12574) dubbed the Gvis Falcon, flew from Otis AFB, Massachusetts to Paris, France. The flight began on 27 May and culminated on 5 June 1963. Total light time was 35.10s hours and included stops in Labrador, Canada, Greenland, and Scotland before landing in Paris. The flight broke the helicopter record for the Atlantic crossing in terms of speed and distance traveled.

The U.S. Navy balited three CH-3As to the Air Force for use in recovering drones at Tyrolla Air Force Base, Florida. The USAF changed the serial number from Bulo 149009 to 62-12571. The first of the three aircraft was finished in standard Navy colors. (USAF)The Danish Air Force (_Kongglee Danske Flyvenaben_) ordered eight CH-3bs and used the Sikorsky S-61A model number as their designator. Externally the Danish S-61A differs from the CH-3b in two major respects. The responses are much larger, since the Danes chose the sponsons need on the Sikorsky model 5-61N civil variant for added stability in rough water operations, and in the addition of five cabin windows for more observation stations.

The Danish S-61A has served with _Kalahide_ \(\mathbf{\dot{\mathbf{\dot{\mathbf{\dot{\mathbf{\dot{\mathbf{\dot{\mathbf{\mathbf{\dot{\mathbf{ \mathbf{\mathbf{\mathbf{\mathbf{\mathbf{\mathbf{\mathbf{\mathbf{\mathbf{  }}}}}}}}}}}}}} }\)22 or of Verades in the SAR five since their service introduction. The S-61A has been modified and upgraded with the addition of color weather research radar and an ic/FOD shield in front of the engine air intakes. Originally delivered in Natural Mental with Orange identification panels, the S-61As are now finished in a Medium and Dark Gray technical scene.

The Royal Malaysian Air Force (_Tenze Lotar Lotar Unique Malaysia_) ordered thirty-five CH-3b in 1967 under the designation S-61A-4 and renamed the Sea King, the Nutri. The Malaysian S-61A-4s are used in the tactical assault, SAR, and cargo roles. S-61A-4 Nuris are equipped with rescue hosts, auxiliary fuel tanks, and provisions for up to thirty-one seats.

Beginning in 1992, third-four of the Nuris were upgraded with a supplemental avionics package consisting of weather radar, a Doppler navigation system and a radar altimer. This avionics package increased the operational capability of the Malaysian S-61A-4s and will enable the TUDM to fly the S-61 well into the 21st Century.

One CH-38 (S-61A) was delivered to civilian users as a construction helicopter. The number 4 and 5 USAT CH-38, serial number 6-12574 and 21575, were hailed to the U.S. Navy and converted to SH-3H standards with full ASW capability. The converted CH-38 were used by Heliicover Anti-subamera Spaudeon (TB3-10) on the Pacific coast. HS-10 operates as the fleet replacement and mining squadron for the Pacific fleet out of North Island.

In late 1962 the USAF issued a request for proposals (RFPs) for a cargo helicopter that could lift 17,000 pounds and be able to load cargo as large as a standard jep. Sticoxyly responded to the power with a variant of the H-3 with the company design 5-61k. On 17 June 1963 the USAF placed an order for twenty-two Sticoxyly model 5-61k s under the designation CH-3C.

The CH-3C (5-61k) was a development of an earlier Skioxly design for the U.S. Marine Corps, the HRS3-1. The HRS3-1 had been in development of the USMC usage 1985 and had been the front runner in the competition to replace the HUS (UH3-4) utility helicopter, a competition that was eventually up by Boeing-Verot with their model 107M (CH-46).

The CH-3C was an extensively modified H-3, that featured a redesigned flashing with a hydraulically operated near leading cargo ramp at aicycle lending gear with fully retractable main and a partially retractable main gear gear. The main gear extracted into this possession that were filled flush to the fusque sides, unlike the spoons on the earlier H-3-A/3 had the sponsons from all to supports. An Auxiliary Power Unit (APU) was fitted for independent field operations. A 2.000 pound worth was van extired internally to assist in the loading of bulky

The CH-3C was also fitted with an external rescue host and provisions for external cargo slag loads. The rotor blades were pressurized for quick and easy inspection for flaws and damage. Unlike the USMC version and the earlier H3-A/B/, the rotor blades would not fold. The rotor system also have self-bridening main and tail rotor bearings.

The CH-3C was powered by a pair of General Electric T-58-1 shaft that produced 12.50 gps. The engines drove the five blade mid rotor and tail rotor through a free wheeling transmission. The transmission was equipped with a rotor brake to slow rotor rotation upon landing. The CH-3C had a maximum speed of 165 and a normal cruising speed of 154 mph. Service cooling was used at 11,000 feet and it had a range of 500 miles. Energy weight was 11,939 pounds and maximum take off weight was 22,000 pounds. The overall length, including rotor blades, was 73 feet and breakage length was 57 feet 3 inches. Overall height was 16 feet 1 inch. Total capacity was 840 gallos, carried in two bladder type fuselage tanks under the load force area.

The CH-3C could carry up to twenty-five troops or 7,567 pounds of cargo and was fully amphibious. An external cargo sling host was fitted that could accommodate up to 8,000 pounds and its way provided with an emergency jettis capability.

The first GH-3C flow on 17 June 1963, and received a FAAT type approval on 30 December 1963, the same day that it was accepted by the USAF at Tyndall AFB, Florida for drone recovery duties. A total of seventy CH-3C were built in six serial number blocks and were A CH-3C of the 37th Air Rescue Squadron on the ramp at Danning Air Base, South Vietnam. The 37th ARS was activated at Danning to operate in 1 and 1G Corps of South Vietnam as well in North Vietnam. The CH-3C had a top speed of 180 mph and could carry up to twenty-six troops. (USAP) Ohio, where the possibly sits on display.

Operations by the ARS showed a need for greater range, endurance, and armor protection. Out of this need was created the HH-3C, an armed and armed version of the CH-3C.

HH-3C

The HH-3C was a basic CH-3C model, modified to be more effective in the rescue and recovery role. The HH-3C was staffed with two external 200 gallon fuel tanks on the sponsons, additional full traize in the sponsons, armor protection for vital engine and transmission parts, plus armor protection for the crew. The flight crew were seated in armored seats and other varicous crew suction was also amored. The aircraft was named with 7.62AM M60 machine guns in fuselage side windows and 4.762AM M60 was mounted on the cargo ramp. A total of twelve CH-3C were brought to HH-3C standards and four of them were destroyed in Southeast Asia operations.

The JCH-3C was a development of the CH-3C and the fifth production CH-3C (serial 62-12581) was used in the program. The JCH-3C was used for service tests with the Aeronautical Systems Division (ASD) at Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio. The JCH-3C was used to test the sole shelf/foreign object detector in front on the engine air intakes and the new bifilar absorber assembly on the main rotor head, as well as many of the new features and upgrades used on the CHHH-3C models.

H-3E Jolly Green Giant

The H-3E was a development of the H-3C; Skioxsky model S-61R, with operated 1,500 abp General Electric T-58-5 engines. The H-3E was built in two different versions; the CH-3E, a cargo/transport version and the HH-3E, the armed and armored SAR aircraft. Both versions retained the rear cargo loading ramp and the large external sponsons of the CH-3C. The sponsons were for stabilization in water and to provide a fairing for the retractable main undercraig. The sponsons also acted as an attachment point for the 200 gallo external fuel tanks on the HH-3E models.

The higher horsepower engines on the H-3E allowed for a higher gross lucked weight, up to 22,500 pounds. The increased horsepower of the T-58-GE-5 engines came in very handy in the high, hot operating conditions of Suttwada Asia.

The CH-3E began operations in South Vietnam during 1966, living out of Dame Air Base and Nakhon Phonon (NXP), Thailand. The CH-3E were sorted to evenly various U.S. Army and Marine Corps outputs and were also called upon to perform at rescue duties.

The HH-3E were pure built for Aerospace Rescue and Recovery duties. The basic CH-3E are written as modified to include the addition of over 1,000 pounds of Titanium armor plate for the protection of the pilot, or pilot, and various mechanical components such as the engines, transmission, oil, coolers, and hydraulic systems. The canopy was shateeptoned and the gun were provided with minor plate. The HH-3E was used to rescue dowed air, whether or land or water and therefore the fuselve was made anteropered for water inding.

The HH-3E was armed with up to three 7,026 gallo and were also filled with a 30 callor fiber machine gun for added protection. The usual placement was a gun in the left forward fuselage window opening, one in the right cargo door and one on the cargo ramp.

Additionally, certain HH-3E models were modified to carry the TAT-102B 7.62 Mitigation target, one mounted on each nylon. The guns were aimed from stations in the forward feselape, usually utilized by the machine gumers. The Mitigus were provided with 8,000 rounds of ammunation and had a rate of five 4,000 \(\pm\) 1,300 rounds per minute.

There were three methods employed to rescue downed ammer using the HH-3E, although only two were used operationally in Southeast Asia. The first method was to land near the downed amt and simply have him climb onboard, the second method was by using the feet-est penterattracted to the high speed rescue bus which was equipped with 320 feet of **A** HC-130P out of Chu Lai, South Vietnam retrails a HH-3E (67-47070) of the 37th ARRS based of Danang Air Base, over Loos. The 37th ARRS began operations from Danang during 1956, covering the northern sections of South Vietnam and Loos, as well as areas of Cambodia and North Vietnam. (Major E.E., Hatch, USAE)from the Cambodia and Laos operating areas.

The HH-3Es were named Jolly Green Giants due to their color scheme of two tone Green and Tan campodia, and because they looked like the cartoon character of the same name that sold green named vegetables. The HH-3Es was the first production helicopter to be able to air-to-air retuel. The relighting probe was attached to the right side of the forward fuselage and the probe would extend out ten feet to provide adequate clearance for the drop and the retuel blades. The British-developed probe and drooge system was utilized because the USAF flying homo type system could not be utilized with a helicopter. The HH-3E were normally reflected by a HC-130 aircraft since the refueling pools were mounted on the outboard wing positions providing adequate clearance.

The HH-3E had a total feet capacity of 640 gallon in three under-floor self-sailing fuel tanks and 400 gallons in the two external fuel tanks, giving it an unrefueled range of over 800 miles.

The HH-3E was also fitted with the Hover In-flight and Refuel (HFR) system, this concept had been used with success by the earlier HH-3A Navy SAR helicopers in Southeast Asia.

With air-to-air refueling, arose was limited only to cover endurance.

The 4-271 mile light established helicopter world records for range, speed and endurance. Refueled in flight nine times, the flight was made to commence the New York to Paris flight of Charles Lindenberg some forty years earlier. Ironically, one of the two HH-3Es that participated in the record flight (serial. 65-12785) was the only HH-3E to be used in the Son Tay prison rail, some three years later. Further adding to the itory, the HH-3E had

In 1985, an operational test and evaluation was made using a HH-3E from the 71st SOS. Owing to the success and effectiveness of the Soviet M-3 gunship, the HH-3E was fitted with 2.75 inch folding for ricotel posts and firing tests were undertaken in the Goldwater North medical range, Gila Bead, Arizona. The firing tests were successful, but no value was seen by the VSAF for an attack/gunship since the US Army's AH-64 Apache would perform the same duties with a much more survivable airframe.

Beginning in 1991, CI/HH-3E has that were considered surplus to USAF, USAF reserve and Air National Guard units were being flow to Fort Baxter, Alabama to be stripped of all essential flight equipment, including the redieuing boxes on the HH-3E models and converted into drones. The conversions were to have taken place at Carims Army Airfield located just south of the main base for Fort Backer. Once the drone program locums fully operational, the QCH-3E were to be used to sharpen the aerial gamers skills of the OH-580 Kious Warrier and the AH-64 Apache pilots and ganners, but due to a lack of funds, the entire project was canceled.

In 1989, the USAF began the transfer of ten CI-3E to the U.S. Coast Guard for conversion to HH-3F standards and also to provide sparse for the existing HH-3F fleet. Five of the CH-3E were converted to HH-3F standards with the addition of an auxiliary fusage mounted fuel tank as carried by the HH-3E model, LORAN "C" navigation system, and an APN-215 radar system in the nose. The balance of the CH-3E were used for sparse and instructional purposes. The conversions took place at the Aircraft Repair and Supply Center (ARSC), Elizabeth City, North Carolina. Coast Guard Air Station Traverse City, Michigan operated three of the newly converted HH-3Fs and Elizabeth City, North Carolina operated two. The HH-3Fs will* [12] A CH-3E is directed in for landing aboard the ammunition ship, USB MOUNT MODO (AE-2) during 1981.

## HH-3F Pelican

In 1962, the U.S. Coast Guard ordered four of the Sikorsky HH-52A helicopters for the Search and Rescue (SAR) role. The HH-52A was Sikorsky's model S-62 and eventually the USCG precursor a total of nine-time HH-52A. The HH-52 was basically a mini S-61 (H-3), with a single nutwash engine and a slightly shorter leakage with reduced range.

During 1968, the USCG, recognizing the need for a longer range SAR helicopter, contracted with Sikorsky for the production time of 5-6H models under the designation HH-3F, the first production models were satisfied 1430 through 1438. Soon after production began, the USCG announced that their new HH-3F helicopter would be called the Pelican. The prototype HH-3F (1430) was sent to U.S. Coast Guard Air Station New Orleans on 20 January 1969 for operational tests, evaluation and training.

The HH-3F was the first twin engine helicopter for the USCG and the second one to be turbine powered, the HH-52A being the first. The HH-3F was essentially AH-3E with all the armor and referencing probe removed. The HH-3F was powered by a part of 1,500 ship General Electric TS-62-S engines.

Operation tests and USCG service proved the value of the HH-3F and in 1971 a further thirty-one mere were ordered (sertails 1467 through 1497). This brought the inventory up to a **first HR-3F (1430) makes a water landing demonstrating the water borne method of rescue using the cargo door ramp.

(USCG - Tom (Collesspi)) total of forty, the last HH-3F being delivered on 10 July 1973 from the Sikorsky factory in Stanford, Connecticut.

The HH-3F was the only H-3 U.S. armed forces model to be fitted with a nose mounted radar. The thimble nose radome was mounted on the port side nose section housing an APN-215 search and weather radar. The radar enables the HH-3F to operate in adverse weather conditions. Further enhancing operational capability is the LORAN "C" navig navigational system and the automatic flight control system that provides for automatic flight into a hover.

The HH-3F retained the fuselge length of the carrier HH-3F of 57 f 3 inches, but parage was reduced since the HH-3F did not retain the external fuel tanks. Internal tenalent at 642 gallos, unlike the HH-3F these tanks were not self-scaling since this feature was not required. The HH-3F had a maximum taskoff of height 22.050 pounds and can accommodate up to twenty-five passengers/vistors, fifteen litter patients or 5000 pounds of internal cargo. An external cargo sling load of up to 9,000 pounds can also be carried. Maximum speed is restricted to 165 mB.

Rescue by the HH-3F can be accomplished in many different ways. By using the 800 pound capacity basis that is located on the stardwheel fuselge upper side, a rescue basket, stokes litter of singe can be lowered to effect a rescue. Using the aircraft's amphibian capability, the HH-3F pilot can land on the water and fold out the rescue platform from the stardard emerge door so that a rescue can be made by the cabin crew.

The standard crew complement of a USCG HH-3F consists of the command pilot, co-pilot, flight mechanica, avionicsman, and a rescue swimmer, who is qualified as an emergency medical technician.

Agusta of Italy license produced a total of thirty-four aircraft under the designation AS-61R (HH-3F) for the Italian Air Force for use in the SAR role by the 15\({}^{\circ}\) Steromo. The Italians, like the USCG, have painted their AS-61Rs in an overall White scheme. The Italians though have used Yellow identification bands and Orange panels where the USCG have used International Orange bands and panels. The Italian AS-61R retains the nose mounted weather radar that is an identification feature of the HH-3F/AS-61R.

## SH-3G

In 1971, the U.S. Navy began the conversion of eleven SH-3A and SH-3D airframes into utility versions of the Sea King under the designation SH-3G. Eventually 105 of the earlier models were converted to SH-3G standards. The conversions and upgrades included the removal of all AWS year and provisions to install 175 gallon external fuel tanks on the lowerpson system. The SH-3G was also fitted with an improved freling system that would resemble to River In-Fight for In-Fight and Refel (HIRP). Using this system, the SH-3G could lower over a ship and, using the rescue basic cable, host the refetching base board and accomplish the fueling process.

A SH-3G to Teleoper Control Support Squadron One (HC-1) is cranded aboard ship. McC-1, known as the Fleet Angels. was established as HH-1 in 1948 and redesigned as RC-1 in 1965. HC-1 Detachment Three (Det 3) was stationed aboard USS TARMA during Operation DESET STOM. (Navy)

Further conversions and improvements included the strengthening and reinforcement of the load floor area to handle heavy capv. The reinforced floor could also be fitted with a gun mount for a M-60 7.62km machine gain. Six early SH-3G were fitted with the 7.62km Mitigation, similar to the HH-3A, but these were later deleted in favor of the M-60 mount. The SH-3G was powered by the same General Electric T-8-GE-10 engines that powered the SH-3D and all SH-3G were fitted with smaller non-AWS sponsons since they would not be used in the AWS role.

The first SH-3G was assigned to Helicopter Combot Support Squadron One (HC-1) Fleet Angels, Detachment One, stationed ADU USS RANG(XC-6). US RANG(XC-3), have detachments serving around USS RANG(XC-4), USS RANG(XC-4), USS CORAL. SEA (CVA-43) and USS HANCOCK (CVA-19). Twenty SH-3Gs were assigned to HC-2 Circuit Ridgers at NAS Lab Labstecht, New Jersey and detachments were stationed aboard USS JRONEI(XC-6), US FARANL1D. ROOSEVELT (CVA-42) and USS AMERICA (CVA-66). The SH-3Gs were used in the utility role performing ship to shore transport of personnel and equipment and plane guard duties.

In January of 1972, Helicopter-Anti-submarine Squadron Fifteen (HS-15) Red Lions was deployed aboard the USS GUAM (LPH-9) to evaluate the SH-3G in the Sea Control Ship concept. HS-15 had been formed in 1971 to evaluate and train supply detachments for Sea

## SH-3h

In 1971, Sikoraky announced an improved version of the SH-3G for the U.S. Navy. Eleven SH-3Gs were initially returned to Sikoraky's Stratford, Connecticut facility for conversion to SH-3H standards.

The conversion included the addition of an ASW equipment suite similar to that carried on the SH-3D, including a AQS-81 MAD towed body fitted to the starboard sponson and dipping Sonar. Upgrades included Electronic Surveillance Equipment (ESM) to detect incoming missiles might threat the fleet and Canadian-Marconi L85HHP radar, which was installed under the fuselage. Smoke marker launches were added to the port sponson and an external chafframe disease was fitted to the port at fuselage side for airborne self-protection against ground-to-air missiles.

With the success of the SH-3G to SH-3H conversion, the U.S. Navy began to convert earlier SH-3A and SH-3Ds the newer SH-3H standards. Two USAT CH-3Bs were also balied to the U.S. Navy and brought up to H20N standards, they would go on to severe with HS-10. The first thirty-five aircraft were compiled by 1976 and when the conversion program was finally terminated, a total of 163 H-3s bad been brought up to SH-3H standards. In 1976 the Canadian-Marconi sea search raar was eliminated that are near useed to install sononomy launches. The ESM equipment was also eliminated and replaced by an altitude heading reference system. A sonouay/data link system emanas was fitted on the lower fuselage spine centerline to receive information from the sonouays.

The SH-3H has an empty weight of 11,865 pounds and a maximum take off weight of 21,200 pounds. Maximum speed is rated at 136 mph and the aircraft has a service ceiling of 14,000 feet. Range is over 600 miles due to the addition of a third fuel cell in the fuselage, bringing total fuel capacity to 840 gallos. The SH-3H's that had been converted from the earlier SH-3G had the sponsons supports plumbted for external fuel tanks, but the SH-3A and SH-3D conversions did not have this capability. The SH-3H is powered by a pair of 1,400 ship General Electric T5S-62-10 watchfast engines. As a protection against ice build up on the engine intake area in the shell/Foreign Object Detector (FOD) was fitted in front of the engine air intakes. This device was also retrofitted to the earlier SH-3Gs all in service.

The SH-3H has provisions to carry up to four Mark 46 aerial torpedoes or a combination of torpedoes and mines on its four external sensors stations. Like the earlier versions, the SH-3H is capable of carrying the B-3T or B-61 nuclear weapons. For self-protection, up to two M-60 machine guns can be mounted to the load floor area, and the crew can be armed with versions of the M-61ffe.

The new SH-3H joined the fleet with Helicopter Antisubmarine Squadron Seven (HS-7) Shamuods aboard USS SARATOGA (CV-60) during 1973. As the SH-3H became available, in greater numbers all of the ASW squadars on the East and West coasts were eventually required the greatly openedly the greatly SH-3H. NAS Jacksonville, Florida became the home of Helicopter Antisubmarine Wone for the East Coast ASW squadars and NAS North Island, California the home of Helicopter Antisubmarine Warfare Wing for the Pacific coast. HS-1 Seahores were named as the Fleet Readiness Squadron (RAG) for the East coast and HS-10 Taksmasters serves as the Pacific RAG.

During 1985, HS-6 Indians sent a one aircraft detachment aboard the destroyer USS KIN-CAID (DD-965) for a one month test of the new sonar data computer. The new computer demonstrated the usefulness of the passive processing capability of the sonchuops in conduction with the computer. The test also proved the usefulness of a ASW helicopter being based aboard the small decks of frigates and destroys. The first basing of a Sea King on a destroyer's was in 1966 when HS-2 served in the SAR role in the Toolin Gulf of North Vietnam aboard USS MARIAN (DOLO-17).

## 7 Ush-3h

In 1987, the U.S. Navy began replacing the SH-3G and SH-3H with various navaliated versions of the Sikoreky H-60 Schwarzschild, the Sekanak offered improved performance in the ASW role and the ability to operate off smaller shipboard helpuls. One big drawback of the Sekanak lies in each volume, the H-60 has 385 cubic feet of cabin volume while the SH-3H has a volume of 1.050 cubic feet. The Sekanak, although of a newer design, does not offer the speed, range of load carrying capability of the older Sea King.

During 1992, the U.S. Navy began the conversion of a number of SH-3H aircraft by removing all ASW equipment and strengthening and reinforcing the flood floor area. The revised SH-3H was redesigned USH-3H, to show its true utility role. HC-2, out of NAS Norfolk began operating their USH-3H is in 1992, in support of Atlantic fleet operations.

Test and Civilian

Skioxly manufactured two different models for the civilian market, the S-61L and S-61N, both very similar to the military SCH-3/AB except for a longer fuselage.

The S-61L is the non-amphnian model and it incorporates a conventional non-retractable main landing gear configuration for land use. Other features common to the S-61L are a controllable horizontal stabilizer and non-folding rotor blades, as in the S-61R model. The S-61L was originally powered by a pair of General Electric Stress-62L-10.3 and turbine engines. These were later replaced by 1,500 phys CTS-1405 minutes. With the new engines installed the aircraft is designated as the 56-61ML. This T. S-61L has a top speed of 150 mph and a normal cruise speed of 140 mph. Fuselage length is 85 feet 11 inches compared to 54 feet 9 inches on the military version. The additional length is a plug just forward of the engine intakes. The S-61L represents a nominal crew of a pilot, copoint and one flight alarm. Up to twenty-eight passes can be accommodated or up to 8000 pounds of internal cargo can be carried when it is configured as a cargo/legighter.

The first flight the prototype S-61L was made on 6 December 1960 and it received a FAA type approval on 2 November 1961. Two S-61L's were assembled in Japan by Mitsubishi for **The first prototype S-72**, a joint NASA/Amy aircraft, makes a total flight at NASA's Ames-Dryglen Flight Research Facility located at Edwards AFB, California. The flight systems from a S-61 were used in the S-72. (NASA)

Nito Airways, Pan American and Los Angeles Airways each operated three S-61L's.

Carson Helicopters of Perkaise, Pennsylvania modified one of their S-61L's helicopters by shortening the fuselage by 50 inches making it the same length as the CH/SHAA military model. Carson also upgraded the external sling capability to 11,000 pounds over the previous 10,000 pounds.

On 6 October 1964, the S-61L and S-61N became the first transport helicopters to receive FAA approval for instrument flight operations, greatly expanding flight operations in adverse weather.

By far the most popular of the two civilian models was the S-61N, which was similar to the S-61L, but with a sealed fuselage for amphibitions operations. The S-61N also was equipped with large shidding flats mounted on the landing gear supports. The sponsons also acted as fairfires for pretextable manufacturing underactine. The first flight of the S-61N occurred on 7 August 1962. The S-61N has a empty weight of 12,225 pounds and a maximum takeoff weight of 19,000 pounds. As in the S-61L, a normal crew of three is carried. Passenger capacity is restricted to twenty-six due to increased weight of the associated landing gear and sponsons.

Over thirty airlines around the world still operate the S-61L and S-61N in regular passenger speeds per **5-72**, Rotor Systems Research Aircraft was fitted with wings and turboles to explore the dynamics of compound helicopter operations. The aircraft could be flown as a fixed wing aircraft or as a helicopter, or both. (NASA)

The most popular civilian model is the S-61N. The S-61N was amphibious and could carry up to twenty-five passengers or up to 7,000 pounds of cargo internally. Anset-Ana was one of the first customers for the S-61N. (Shorsty)

The Canadian Coast Guard uses the S-61N in the Search and Rescue (SAR) and utility roles on the Pacific coast. The aircraft is overall Red with a White fuselage stripe. It carries an air data probe on the rotor head. (Canadian Coast Guard via Rod Nelson)
