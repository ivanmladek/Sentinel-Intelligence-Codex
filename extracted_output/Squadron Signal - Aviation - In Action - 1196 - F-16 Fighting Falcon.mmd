## 6 Introduction

The United States went to war in Southeast Asia with airplanes which had been designed to accommodate a Cold War strategy that envisioned waves of _Swire_ nuclear bombers threatening the North American continent. The Century States of Baffers and all Wayy_ and asked flight-er aircraft were either engaged for point defense or delivery of nuclear weapons. Most were less than today 16 flight the air war which evolved in Vietnam, and it didn't take the services long to realize this.

Early in the Viet Sum war, USA's fairness proposed a new fighter, designed from the exterior to capable of long-range short-downs or for superiority inclose in-dog fighting. It would be a large, complex fighter with powerful radar, multiple emissions, and an internal gan. It was designated as the Fiber Experimental (FX) and would eventually emerge as the McDonald Douglas F-15 Eagle. On a parallel development track, USA's also proposed a new lightweight, advanced by fighter (ADPs).

In spite of the fact that the United States was in a shooting war in Southeast Asia, the real enemy remained the Soviet union, and most newspapers were planned around considering the Society, USA's guest pioneers may have vanished the lightweight (figure more than the FX, but the obvious works involved the McG 25, there was no question about which fighter would get funded first and recommend.

Despite a _Fighter_ Mini's of aerial helicities within the Beattest, by Taylor John Boyd and Peredington System Against Jersey, continued by changing the lightweight gabor, except their efforts were reward when it de la January 1991, a Request For Proposals (RFP) was issued to the industry, the RFD effort to a high throughput in a gross weight of less than 20,000 pounds, and high maneuverability. No attempt would be made to qualify the performance of the McG-15-Fobust, the emphasis being fixed on the most likely conditions of future air combat- athletes of 30,000-4,000 feet and speeds of which 0.6 to 13th.

The emphasis was on turn rate, acceleration, and range rather than on high speed. Heaking to use of the lessons of aircraft's combat in Vietnam, where the similarities arise of the adversary MRG, had given an adventy over the hager US. fighting, small size was specified for the new lighter. The RFP specified three main objectives. The aircraft should fully explore the advantages of emerging technologies, reduce the risk and uncertainties involved in full-scale development and production, and provide a variety of technological options to meet future military hardware needs.

Free manufacturers submitted proposals in respect to the RFP -- Boeing, Northrop, General Dynamics, Ling-Tenco-Vogrid, and Lockheed. In March of 1972, the Air Sufff co-cluded that the competing Boeing Model 908-909 was the first tosco, with the General **V5-10** number **by** **two** **the** **T5-10** number **by** **two** **the**
The SF-16

Wienthe Lightweight Filter competition was completed early in [197], both the YF-16 and the TF-17 showed great opening. On 13 January 1973 the Air Free announced that the YF-165 performance had made it the winner of its Air Combat Faberio (ACF) competition. General Dynamics YF-16 had generally shown superior performance over its rival from Northern. It was also delayed to have further on costs lower than expected, both for initial procurement and over the life of the place. The TF-16 had also proved the usefulness of fly-by-wire flight controls, and innovative reduced seat status and transparent head-up display (HUD) panels to facilitate high-G maneuvering, and the use of high percline, one-piece concepts to give pilots greater visibility.

The first of the two YF-16 prototypes, designed by a GD team under Harry Hilkaker, was rolled out on 13 December [973], only 21 months after award of the contract. Initial flight of the TF-16 was from Edwards Air Force Base (AFB) in California or 20 January 1974, flown

itor (the sc-called "big tail"), which provided better stability and more authority for departure recover situations. It also changed takeoff rotation speed and allowed stable flight at higher angles of attack.

Block I5 aircraft also have two digoethorat radar waning antennas parallel to each other on the bottom of the endcaps. The blade antenna bests the air intake was deleted.

The ANA/P.66-fold radar on the Block I5 F-16A/D was provided with an early version of a track-white-skin code for greater air defense capability. Also included were "Have Quick T" secure UHF viceor radios. Additional structural steepening was added to allow an extra 1000 pounds of endurance to be carried on the underlying hard points.

A program to upgrade systems and various of Block I5 F-16A/D8, code named Pacer Loft,1 was announced in 1992. A second Pacer Loft upgrade program was started in December of 1983.

There were 457 Block I5 F-16A/B8 built in the U.S., 410 As and 47 Bs. They were ordered over fiscal years 1990-83 and delivered between November 1981 and March 1985. Also included in the bank were 49 aircraft for Egypt, 40 for Pakistan, 42 for Venezuela, and 60 ad-no aircraft for the Netherlands. The Block I5 Operational Coughty Upgrade (OCU) refers to F-16A/B8 powered by the more reliable F100-P/B200 turbine. These aircraft also had structural strengthening and were provided with the enlarged HUD thus was first increased on the F-16C/D. The OCU included updates for radar and software, and upgrades for the fire control and stores management computers. A data transfer unit was added, and a radar altimeter was provided. Provision was made for the carrying of AN/ALQ-131 jamming rods, and installation of any large linear navigation system. F-16A/B8 manufactured since 1988 were built to OCU standards (starting with Block I5V), with either Block I5 aircraft later being brought up to OCU status. The OCU program makes the F-16A/B8 comparable in many respects to F-16C/D models. Block I500T F-16A/B8 were delivered as-dom for Belgium (44), Denmark (12), the Netherlands (51), and Norway (23). Also included were planes delivered in the late 1980 and early 1990s to Indonesia (12), Pakistan (11), Portugal (20), Singapore (8) and Thailand (18).

Production for the USAE traded 675 F-16A/B8 and 120 F-16B/B8, Of these, two F-16A/B8 (82-0966.88-0974) were held by Pickard and three F-16A/B8 were built by SAHC. The remainder were built by Fort Worth. Fort Worth toff 677-16A/B8 for Israel, 39 for Egypt, 28 for Pakistan, 18 for Venezuela, eight for Thailand, eight for Indonesia, 12 for Singapore, and 6 for Malaysia.

**APF operations of the A model are recognizable by the bulge at the base of the vertical fin. The bulges are caused by the relocation of the Benicke-King AN/ALQ-200 high frequency single-sideband radio to the leading edge of the fin, which necessetanted the flight control accumulators to be relocated to either side of the tail fin. The bulges provide sufficient room for these accumulators.

## F-16 Fighting Falcon

General Arrangement (cut away)

The Garrett hydroazine turbine emergency power unit (EPU) on the starboard side of the fuselage, just atl of the canopy. (Andre Jas)Early in 1983, the Thunderstparts consistently their traditional role of demonstrating the Air Force's frontline fighter capabilities by transitioning to the F-16A Fighting Falcon from the T-84 Talon. The F-16 has proven to be the most long-lived of any Thunderbird aircraft, 21 years and counting at this writing. Further testament to the ability of the F-16 altrame to keep up with technological change. (Shinichi Ortala)

Most F-16A rely on a pair of very effective apod brakes for decelerating during landing. They are also deployed on approach to maintain high engine RIII and responsiveness in the event a go-around is necessary. (John Gourley)One of the areas in which the F-16 advanced aircraft design dramatically was the ergonomics of how pilots deal with the sustained high-G environment common in modern registers. The F-16 cockpit seat is resilience at 30 degrees, and the pilot uses a side-site controller which has no mechanical linkages to the controls. The fly-by-wire control system serves pressure on the stick and provides control inputs that are appropriate....with the concurrence of the flight control computer which does not allow departure from controlled right. An adjustment arm rest behind the side-site controller helps to reduce fatigue in high-G maneuving. Traditional "stean gages" (analog instruments) assume a secondary position on the F-16 instrument panel. The head-only display (HUOI) provides all the information the pilot needs to fly and fight. Multi-function allows the pilot to control the various systems, including sophisticated weapons and navigations/regontiers controls. The photos on this page are of an F-160, circa 1994.

weather conditions and at night. The F-16 traded its analog flight controls for a digital system and new one arrives,

The landing gear of the Black 4042A was beefed up and extended to handle the LANTHEN pods and move extensive air-to-ground loads. The landing gear by doors burge slightly by design to handle the larger wheels and tires. The LANTHEN pods also forced the landing lights to move forward from the sustus of the main landing gear on the landing inside edge of the base landing gear. A larger head-up display occurred the LANTHEN system as well.

The precision sequences incorporated by the Black 4042 made the GUB-10, GBU-12, GUB-24 Puewamy family of laser-guided bombs as well as the GBU-15 light bomb.

Block 4042 also saw the addition of the AFG-80V radar, automatic terrain following (part of the LANTHEN system, global positioning system), are no routine-pressure breathing system to improve g tolerance for the pilot, full provisions for internal electronic counter measures, an enhanced envelope sign sign, and a capability for combining moving ground targets. Some configurations of the aircraft can carry the M4042 S-Puewamy missile.

Block 4042A production began in 1988 and 2nd through 1995. Twenty-one fiber Block 408s were built for EBU from 1996 to 2002. Babin is considering more Block 408s to equip a scene-of-spudot. The 744 Block 4042 aircraft produced to date can be distinguished externally from previous F-16 blocks by their landing lights and by the bolged landing gear doors. Any USAR-15 F-16 chips a LANTHEN pods is a block 4042A.

Some USA's Black 40 aircraft are now equipped and flying missions with night vision goggles and with a data link system called State Streh. This system receives highly accurate position information from a forward aircraft or the ground. The system then inputs the data into the system system computer and displays it as a way point of the head-up display. There exists several time steps we have assigned the F-16 is about two months of off-the-shelf equipment. The data is also used on the Apache helicopter. An upgrade program to Store Streh, called GUB-16 Striks, adding two-way imagery transmissions.

Block 5052F-16-as equipped with a Northerned GUB-172 radar and a General Electric F10-GUB-129 Increased Performance Engine, the aircraft also capable of using the Leactivated Martin low-altitude navigation and targeting for night (LANTHEN) system. Technology enhancements include output multiconfigs and programmable display generator, a new MiddleM Mission Computer, a Digital Ternian System, a new MiddleM Mission Computer, a Digital Ternian System, a new MiddleM system and an order and order multi-detox web controller in the pilots backup display vise, and an upgraded data transfer unit. By mid-1998 Block 5052 (last Block 505 Pish) F-16s will carry the RD-103/104/105 Wills-Oriented Muhrs Digener, the AGM-154 Joint Saard-Off Waveage, and the GUB-15/312 Worknet Attack Monitor.

Block 505/52D Wiall Wiesel F-16CJ variants include C-Model and D-Models. It is best recognized for its ability to carry the AGM-81BARM and the NAS/203-13ARM Targeting System (HITS) in the Suppression of Energy Air Defensive (SEAD) mission. The ITS allows HARM to be employed in the range-known mode providing longer range shots with greater specificity. This specialized version of the F-16, which can also carry the ALD-119 Electronic Jamming Pod forself protection, became the sole provider for Air Force SEAD missions when the F-46W Willeal was retired from the Air Force Inventory. The full SEAD mission now rests solely on the shoulders of the F-16 HARM Targeting System. Although F-18s and E-46A-68s are HARM capable, the F-16 provides the ability to use the HARM in its most effective mode. The original concept called for turning the F-15 Precision Precision Folding (POP) and the F-16S ITS. Because this scanning concept is no longer feasible, the current approach calls for the improvement of the HTS capability. The improvement will come from the Joint Ennerte Targeting System (JETS), which facilitates the use of HARMs most effective mode when launched from any JETS capable aircraft.

Advanced Block 50/52 aircraft have a common engine bay that allows customers a choice of engines in the 29,000-pound thrust class. The Block 50s are powered by the General Electric F110 GE-129 and have the Modular Common Intel (hpc) known as the large mouth interlo). Block 60 aircraft for the UAV are fitted with GE-110-GE-132 engine, a derivative of the F-110-GE-129 that is rated at 32,500 pounds of thrust. The Block 52s are powered by the Part R Whitney F100-PW-229 Improved Performance Engine (IPE) which also has 29,000 pounds of thrust. The engine is configured with the Normal Shock Intel (also known as the small mouth).

The advanced Block 50/52 fleet B60 production species represent the largest configuration change in the F-16 history, offering additional fuel (via coordinated fuel tanks) and payload capacity, new or improved avionics and sensors, color cockpit displays with enhanced pilot/vehicle interfaces. Nine countries have developed Advanced Block 50/5260 E-16-s, including the UAS, Greece, Israel, UAE, Chile and Poland. The lead customer for Block 52 was the Hellenic Air Force website with service all 50 new F-16s in 200. The Israeli Air Force repository is first 1-16s in 2003 and has list of the 102 aircraft is scheduled for delivery by 2008. The lead customer for 80 Block 60 aircraft was the Air Force of the United Arab Emitaries. Initial deliveries were in 2004.

Advanced versions of the Block 50/52 F-16s are difficult to tell from previous F-16s, as most changes are internal. However, the two-seat models of the Advanced Block 50/52 and Block 60 are equipped with a dorsalicos compartment that accommodates all of the systems of the single-seat model as well as some special mission equipment and additional daff/flare dispensics. Most aircraft are procured with Conformal Fuel Tanks (CFT) for extended range and mission endurance. The next cockpit can be configured for either a weapon system over or an instrument pilot and can be converted with a single switch in the cockpit.

The F-16 rule of its first flight on 23 December 2003, Israel's Peace Mobile Y foreign military sales program will supply the Israel Air Force (JAF) with 102 two-seat aircraft and is the largest Israeli F-16 acquisition yet. The F-16f is specially designed for Israel, and has been named "Sofa", or "Shoran" in Hebrew, by the Lar. Production deliveries are scheduled through 2008.

The F-16 incorporates the latest technology and capabilities in an air combat fighter, such as modern core avionics, color cockpits featuring moving mang, Conformal Fuel Tanks and advanced electronic warf displays.

(Above) On 25 June 2003, the U.S. Air Force exercised a contact option associated with Phase II of the 7-16-MHz Communication Implementation Program (COPI) by awarding Lockheed Martin 3858 million for retrofit kits to modify 22 Ricks 4042 aircraft. The F-16-CCP is designed to provide the latest capabilities to approximately 850 Rock 402/605/012 F-16-S operated by the native USAF and an National Gated. The resulting configuration provides high degree of communication by hardware and software, with attendant benefits in logistics support costs, training, operational flexibility and future upgrades. The upgrades also provide a high degree of communication with new production 7-16-MHz functional customers and the 7-16-MHz-wide testing performed on 400 F-16-MHz and operated by five European NATO partners. This F-16-C is armed with MISO- and AIM-120 missiles and 2,000 bound LBSs. (Lockheed Martin)

The ALL-031 ECM Pod is modular in design continuing various electronic receivers, antennas, and powerful transmitters designed to cater the flight path of an incoming energy missile. This modular pod-mounted system can be configured to cope with a range of threats, spread over one to frequency bands, by selecting individual modules for inclusion in the top. Both noise and deception-immune modes are available, and the pod can be reprogrammed to match the expected threat. The ALL-131 ECM pod is controlled from the cockhip by both automat

Pods, Pylons, and Weapons

While the basic aerodynamic shape of the F-16 has remained constant from prototype to the latest blocks, quantum leaps in technology have enhanced it's mission exponentially. This has resulted in the addition of offensive and defensive systems which are often manifested by the addition of various lumps, bumps, antennae, and pods.

The most visually significant addition to the F-16 is the LANTHIN pods. LANTHIN is a system consisting of two pods which allow activeory to fly their aircraft by day or night and in adverse meteorological conditions. It provides Terrain-Following Radar (TFR). Forward-Looking Infra-Red (FLIR), targeting information for the aircrafts on-board fire control system and target lineer illumination. Over 14,000 sec are currently in service with 10 countries.

The LANTHIN system comprises two pods: one ANA/AQ Navigation Pool ("To Fly"), and one ANA/AQ-14 Targeting Pod ("To Fight"). The pods were conceived in a way that allows them to operate autonomously, so either pod can be used without the other should the need varies.

The main sub-systems of the navigation pod are a Texas Instruments Ku-band terrain-following radar (AN/Arx/237A), a wide field-of-view (NFOV) forward-looking infra-red sensor, and the necessary computers and power supplies.

The TFR uses advanced signal processing to provide a wide azimuth coverage, which in turn allows more violent maneuvering of the carrier aircraft. The system can provide directional inputs to the pilot or the flight control computer, whereas older systems and provided pick-up commands.

The TFR significantly enhances the aircraft's chances to survive on the modern battlefield, since it met only allows the pilot to automatically avoid the terrain but also enables him to evade air defense systems by maneuvering horizontally. The radar can be linked directly to the F-16s autopilot to automatically maintain a precise altitude down to 100 feet while flying over virtually any half of terrain. Five modes are available: Normal, Weather, ECCN, Low Probability of Intercept (LPI), and Very Low Clearance (VLC).

The FLIR has a 28 degree field-of-view horvitally and 21 degrees vertically. The resulting images are superimposed on the outside sensor by projecting them on the HUD. The image is gravity, but the sense of depth is good enough to fly in total darkness or the smoke of a battlefield. Radio, ring or smoke shower, degrade the performance of the system, since infra-red is greatly absorbed by aerosols or water vapor. For an expanded perspective beyond normal HUD viewing limits, the pilot can hands-on-throide-and-stick (HOTS)-select snap looks for origin 11 degrees from the center. Another switch allows the pilot to select either a "negative" buffer "or a positive" black hot" image, both green and white rather than black and white.

Main sub-systems of the tragging pod are another forward-looking infrared (FLIR) and a laser designator/range finder. But are housed in the movable nose section of the AN/AAQ-14, and are stabilized by a stabilization system which compensates for aircraft movement and vibration. The FLIR that is installed in a two-axis turter operates in two modes: a wide field-of-view for target acquisition on a narrow one for zooming in. When LANTHIN is not in operation, the turter is rotated to protect the sensors from the elements.

The FLIR can be aimed independently for zooming in on the selected target. Data from the FLIR is fed into one of the multi-function head-down displays in the cockpit and is used to identify terrain features and/or targets at long range.

The post also houses Environmental Control Systems and a bore-tight correlator ("Book where I look") hands-off system which passes targeting data to the aircraft's Fire Control Computer (FCC) and the weapon systems.

The laser legislator can "timantic" targets for laser-guided bounds. It can also be used as automatically track moving targets on the ground as well as to designate them for ASM-6S.

Magnetic masks. It is even possible to designate targets for multiple Northwest shots as a single pass. Another use for the laser is determining the exact distance of a landmark to obtain the aircraft's inertial navigation system. This is critical to accurate delivery of both guided and unoriented confluence without visual references.

With the arrival of Block 50, the F-16 assumed to rule of Suppression of Energy Air Defense (SEAR) for the Air Force. The SEAR mission, which involves the following down or destroying energy surface-to-air missile sites, was formerly performed by the F-4G Phantom. The primary insists used in these missions to exhibit the High-Speed anti-radiation Maskie (HARM). The latest version of the F-16 carries a special Up to EART Imaging System, that makes this missile even more effectively F-18 with HARM and HTS were used in the August-September 1975 (Operation between Probe from which we have been used since then in Operations Northern Watch, Southern Watch, and Iraqi Freedom to destroy fast surface-to-air missile sites.

The ASM-8S HAARD (high-speed anti-radiation missile) is a supersonic air-to-surface ICI-cal missile designed to seek and destroy energy radar equipped at defense systems. The ASM-8S can detect, attack and destroy a target with minimum energy input, guidance is provided through reception of signals emitted from a ground-based linear radar. If the capability of discriminating a single filter from a number of entities in the environment, the participant guidance system that homes in an enemy radar emissions has a fixed antenna and seker head in the missile zone. As indicated, self-popping, dual-task network order probe inside,

Recently improved electronic jamming systems extend on the F-16 have increased survivibility. Thermal warning receivers and radar sensors that are stabilisation the type of enemy radar illuminating the aircraft give the pilot performance information.

Counter measures, such as chaff and fares, have been improved. Toward decays have been introduced into the F-16 meter. Degreesrees for these defensive systems are incorporated in some of the prison. Minimature air-launched above are being disconnected as well. Engine improvements have increased survivibility of the F-16 by giving pilots more thrust to evade thrust.

The Air Defense F-16 is a variant of the Block 15 occurred F-16 equipped with some additional systems for the air-to-air rule. It has an improved AF06-68 radar, and a PHY-109 identification from front of the interference, ABC-200 high-frequency radio, disturbed flight data correlator, and 150,000-end/exposure spatial Removal Removal and the leak of the former breakage. The Air Defence F-16 can fire the AM-7 Spurnurno air-to-air radar-enabled missile using continuous wave filamentous from the radar. Like fiber F-16 requires this _effective_ version as free the fire-16 is distinguished by its four-band "flat-sized" sources [first focused on the energy and under the engine inlet and the bibrated all next. The bistens were required to make recent the high-frequency radio equipments.

Two-band user security Block 15 airlines were converted to the air defense configures in the late 18th and early 1990s. All of the aircraft went to the Air National Guard. This first at defense warm was delivered in early 1989. An Air Defense F-16 unit from Fargo, North Dakota, proved the airplanes powers between it when the white 1989.

The F-16 was conceived as a lightweight, dry W/P, air-to-air point ordines fiber. It has prompted into a very capable al-weather fiber/computer. The original and most basic assessment consisted of the AM-9S. Sidewater and internal M-8S Umem common. Both are in contact contact centers of the F-16. They have been augmented by postural-sensing (BVD) misses and practically all of the thumb and smart inputs in the U-S. inventory.

The most versatile missile in the U-S, inventory in the AM-9S Sidewater: the AM-9S Sidewater is a supersonic, heat-seeking, air-to-air missile. It has a high-eigvative surgical and an active winderized system. The Sidewater was developed by the US Navy for fleet at defense and was adapted by the US. Air Force for finger aircraft in the Early versions of the missile were extensively used in the Southeast Asian conflict. In September 1988

TheChinese Nationalist F-86s fired the first Sidewinder air-to-air missiles to down 11 communist Chinese MG-17s over the Formosa Stratis.

The AIM-9M has a cylindrical body with a null-stabilizing rear wing/rolleron assembly. Also, it has extensive, double-delta control surfaces behind the nose that improve the missile's maneuverability. Both rollers and control surfaces are in a cross-like arrangement.

The Infrared guidance head engine the missile to home on target aircraft engine exhaust. An infrared unit cost less than other types of guidance systems, and can be used in day/night and electrico counter measures conditions. The infrared sealer also permits the pilot launch the missile, then leave the area of the outside sewage which the missile guides itself to the target.

The AIM-9M, added a more powerful solid-prepard textile rotor as well as tracking maneuvering ability. Improvements in heat sensor and control systems provided the AIM-9M, missile with an all-agent attack capability and improved guidance characteristics. The L model was the first Sidewinder with the ability to attack from all angles, including head-on. An improved active optical fuse increased the missiles' lethality and resistance to electronic counter measures. A conical scan seker increased scaler sensitivity and improved tracking stability. The AIM-9M, is configured with an annular blast fragmentation warhead. Production and delivery of the AIM-9M, began in 1996. The allseseot heat setting Limn made of the established AIM-9M, skewinder missile was one of the most significant effort around weapons of its time. The AIM-9M, did not require a tail chosen position to lock on to a ellipse, and could lock on from any angle including head-on. Some other deployment the AIM-9M, protect that existing air combat tickets were obsolete, since insureanous tuning performance became far more important than sustained turning performance. The ability to point the circulars nose at an opponent and quickly fire a missile became far more important than the ability to follow through multiple maneuvers to acquire a tail suspect fighter position.

The AIM-9M, currently the only operational variant, has the all-aspect capability of the L model, but provides all-around higher performance. The M model has improved defense against infrared counter measures, enhanced background discrimination capability, and a reduced smoke rocket motor. These modifications increase ability to locate and lock-on a target and decrease the missiles's change for detection. Deliveries of the M model begin in 1993.

The Sidewinder has a range of 10 to 18 miles, depending on altitude, and a nasal speed of Mich 2.5. It has a launch weight of 190 pounds and a per-unit cost of approximately $54,000.

While some ADAF-9F-86s have been modified to allow fire of the AIM-9M's priority mid-night missiles, the primary BKP radar missile in use by all F-16s in the AIM-120. The AIM-120 advanced medium-range air-to-air missile (AMRAM) is a new generation air-to-air missile. It has an all-member, beyond-signal-range capability. AMRRAM is a supervenic, air launched, aerial intercept, guided missile employing active radar target tracking, proportional navigation guidance, and active Radio Frequency (RF) target detection. It employs active, semi-active, and inertial navigational methods of guidance to provide an autonomous launch and have capability against single and multiple targets in all environments.

The AMRRAM weighs 340 pounds and uses an advanced solid-fuel racket motor to achieve a speed of Mich 4 and a range in excess of 300 miles. In long-range engregments AMRRAM heads for the target using inertial guidance and receives updated target information via data link from the launch aircraft. It truncates to a self-patiing terminal mode when the target is within range of its own morphing radar set. The AMR-120 also has a "heme-on-par" guid-arc mode to counter detection jamming. With its sophisticated axionics, high closing speed, and excellent end-game maneuverability, chances of escape from AMRRAM are minimal. Upon intercept an active-rador proximity fuse detonates the 40-round high-explosive warhead

completed in 2004. The rack is also compatible with 500-pound and 1,000-pound Joint Direct Attack Mutations (JDAMs). All these weapons are integrated with only a software change to the F-16.

The BRU-57 is a vertical ejection rack using the latest technology. Compared to the previously used TER-3 ripple generic rack, it has advantages of interfacing with smart weapons, higher reliability and maintainability, and greater safety with lower potential for collision of weapons during release.

The F-16 was the first aircraft to use the BRU-57. The BRU-57 contains two BRU-46 pieces of units already used in the U.S. Air Force inventory.

Defensive systems include shelf and flare disperses, the former to confuse radar-guided missiles. the letter to decay best-seakers, and electronic janners, most commonly carried in pools on the contrieting.

The AN/ALE-40 Counter Measure Dispensed System (CMDS) provides expendible counter measures stores. It allows the filter to release chief off or flare, depending on the insert type, to counter any homing of a missile to the plane. This is a very simple yet effective system. Cliff looks like millions of tiny strands of aluminium foil and each strip is cut to length to match the various wavelengths of the radar. Using shift to combat radar was used as early as WW III and still proves very effective against nearly all radar threads. Flares are white to magnesium that are designed to defeat a missiles infra-red (IR) tracking mechanisms.

The AN/ALE-47 Counter Measures Dispensed System provides an integrated, reprogrammable, computer controlled system to disperse open open/backoutscriptors to enhance aircraft survivability. It is designed to employ electronic and infrared counter measures according to a program developed and implemented by the achieve. ALE-47 provides the airvex with a "smart" computer measures dispensing system, allowing the airvex to optimize the counter measures employed against anti-aircraft threats. The ALE-47 system is an upgraded version of the ALE-40, which is more automatic and is programmable to better enhance its capabilities depending on aircraft mission.

The most commonly carried ECM pods are the AN/ALQ-119, AN/ALQ-131 and the AN/ALQ-184.

The Westinhouse AN/ALQ-119 jammer pod is currently carried on the F-16 and A-10, and previously carried on the F-4 prior to that aircraft's retirement. During the Vietnam War the "The "Pryon Integrated Dispensed System (PIDS)" this **chi-flat** flare disperses to the rear of the outboard stores prior on each night. PIDS is in service with a number of foreign user as well as the USAWG and USAW Reserve. Also shown is the latest aerodynamically efficient (triple pictor) rack (TER) and the AN/ALQ-9 launch ran on the outboard wing station. (John Goureley)

ALQ-119 was carried on the F-4, Phantom II frequently mounted on the ribosomal station, though subsequently it was frequently mounted on the Len Forward Alto-7 missile station.

This noise/deception jammer covered three frequency bands. Current AN/ALQ-119 maintenance activities include programming of new threats and techniques to the system, system performance laboratory testing, threat and weapon systems analysis and technique development, and field support for various range testing of the system.

The AN/ALQ-131 Electronic Counter Measures Pod provides electronic counter measures protection for Vistar, AAFAF, and FRS carry aircraft. The AN/ALQ-131 is certified on the F-16, F-11-1, A-10, F-4, F-15, F-5 and C-150 aircraft. The ALQ-131 EMC Pod is indomir in design containing various electronic receivers, antennas, and powerful transmitters designed to alter the flight path of an incoming enemy missile. This modular-pound-mounted system can be configured to cope with a range of threats, spread over one to five frequency bands.

By selecting individual modules for inclusion in the pod, the user can program the pod to defeat threats. Both noise and exception-jamming modes are available, and the pod can be programmed to match the expected threat. The pod is controlled from the cockpit by both automatic and manual means. The cockpit control indicator is used to turn the system on, erable threat response attains and display system status. EDM pods are pre-programmed on the ground for specific threats that may be encountered.

The AN/ALQ-184 Electronic Attack Pod provides self-protection for the F-16 combat aircraft and new is a complex radar gidded threat environment. Built by Rayfon E-Systems for the Air Force, the AN/ALQ-184 protects aircraft against radio frequency threats by selective-ly directing high power jamming against multiple emitter. In 1995 Rayfon's Goleta, California, electronic warfare operation, which builds the AN-ALQ-184, was combined with the company's E-Systems division.

In May 1998, a follow-on order was placed for 60 Block 40 F-16s, plus an option for 15 more. The first of these Peace Table III Fighting Fakeons arrived in Israel in August 1991. The first of 505 rabbits U.S. Air Force Block 10 F-16s was delivered on August 1, 1994, under the Peace Mudrle IV programme. Delivery was completed in late 1994.

In May 1999, Israel selected the F-16 water completing aircraft, which led to a commer for 50 F-160 Block 52a- signed in January 2000, and an option for up to 60 more aircraft to be exercised in 2001. The Peace Mudrle V aircraft will deliver during 2003 through 2006. The optional aircraft would be delivered in 2006 through 2006 through 2006.

Isani F-16s have extensive local modifications, with different airports fits and higher gross weights, which require changes in the leading gear and the use of new wheels. Israel F-16Cs have been fitted with a number of locally-produced serious items including EBs H.L./E-230 elechesion centre narrows equipment to replace the Leaf Export II, and AS/A/E-40 charflflare dispeters or an implositrones equivalent in place of the newer AN/AL-47 s found or C models used elsewhere. Israel F-16Cs can be equipped with a locally produced ACM debrefing system which is packaged into an inert AN/4-yr andresa as a differential GPS to record the exact tracks of aircraft for replay during post-risking. Some Israeli F-16Cs may use in diagnostics mark such as the E102B 2007 for 2032 line of the A/E-68. Israel Military Industries (MI) has produced a special 600 kg gallo underway drop tank to replace the standard 370 US undergoing drug masks, which extends the comma roils of the F-16 by 50 percent. The maximum air-up weight of an Israel F-16Cs is reportedly 43,000 pounds, as compared to 42,000 pounds for a USAF Blocks 40 F-16C.

Egypt signed a letter of agreement in June 1980 to acquire 42 Block 15 F-16 fibers under the Peace Vector Forcing Military Sales program.

Significant hallmarks of the program are the technology ramiser and the workbase between the two countries. As agreed, Japan is responsible for producing approximately 60 percent of the attract and the United States is responsible for producing approximately 40 percent.

**Rapublic of China (Tavian)**

Since the political improvement with The People's Republic of China (Mailand China) in 1972, supply of military hardware by the United States had been reobiliands, F-16, were weak outside for export, so the Taiwanes represent excited to develop their own version of the F-16, and since technology was one embraced, they were able to create a new lighter development program body based on the F-16.

The Taiwanes are Industry Development Center's (AIDC) "Ching Kuo", is essentially a new aircraft. The design was formalized in 1988, with major assistance from a team of General Dynamics engineering working agency at 850 million US power, namely 400 US power, namely 400 US power/s at a reserved staircase from other US aerospace firms, including Mensco, Guestre, Westinghouse, BendixKing, and LearA Networks.

Four prototypes were built, including three single-set machines and one tandem-set machine. The first prototype reformed its initial flight 2028 May 1999. The first prototype self-record an embarrassing landing accelerator on 9 October 1999, shows that it had some self-judessed in front of Taiwanes President Lee Tang Hui and the press. The damage was not critical and was quickly prepared.

The type received the demand name of "Ching Kuo" in honor of former Taiwanes president Chiang King King. The tandem-start version was intended for operational conversion and foreignly mining, but is output-spatio.

From the side, the Ching Kuo has a certain general resemblance to the Northing F-5, with minor minor for the F-5-second; then F-183 percent from the top, the resemblance to the F-16 is obvious and it could be easily mistaken for an F-16 from such an angle. The arrangement of flight surfaces is very similar, with a re-steps-wise featuring LERCs and some wig-body blending, a single element staffs, and all-nowing horizontal ulplanes.

Taiwan continued to seek F-16% while this program got under way, and was eventually s Experimental F-16s have been used in a variety of use rules, from proving various new control configurations, to sensing new various.

**F-16CCV** The first YF-16 (72-1567) was rebuilt in December 1975 to become the USAF Flight Dynamic Laboratory's Control Congressional Vehicle (CCV), CCV aircraft have independent or "deeoclip" flight control surfaces, which make it possible to maneuver in one plane without movement in another-for example, turning without having to bank.

The CCV YF-16 was tested with its vertical command side underneath and air intake, and flight controls were notified to permit one of using trailing pluggengers acting in combination with the all moving stabilize.

The YF-16CCV Tower for the first time on 16 March 1976, piloted by David J. T. Jigneron. On 24 June 1976, it was successfully damaged in a crash finding after being failed during a loading approach. The aircraft was repaired and its flight set began, was resumed. The YF-16CCV was carried on 31 June 1976 after 28 years and 125 hours.

Is February of 1977 President Jimmy Center announced a new arms transfer policy.

Aiveraging to reduce arm position throughout the world, except for American headquarters could no longer sell to foreign air forces any combat aircraft that was the equal of those in the US (investors). There were exogenously to this rule. The four XF-100 users of the F-16c and an, as special exception, the nation of Israel. Exceptions were also made for arms deliveries to fura on the Sanbout coalline to act as a bank bank against Soviet expansion in the Perisa Gulf region. At first, Soul Koresa request for F-16s was banned down to this new rule, but was later approved as a quid you are for pending US troops withdrawals from Koresa. However, unions such as Josulin, Taiwan, and Venezuela were opened access to the F-16c.

One of the side effects of this new policy was the training of General Dynamics with General Electric to promote a less-example expert over the Fighting Fiction Forward by the f79-GE-17x engine. This project was announced by General Dynamics in November of 1979. The 1979 engine had powered the F-104 Starfinder and the F-4 Platinum. Both of which were already in widespread service with large numbers of foreign air arms. As the 179-GE-119, this engine was installed in F-16h eight smart and 705725. Since the 179 engine required a lower airflow than did the F-16c which focal an application to F-16A/8s, the shape of the air intake was altered, with the intake extending further forward the standard shape and the spider flute being enlarged. Since the 179 engine was less lugged during the F100, the rear flushes had to be extended off the stabilize pivot point, the F-179 struggle ran a lot hotter than the F100 turboma, so a hotter shell weighing about 1st to had to be installed around most of the level of the new engine to provide protection from the rear. The aircraft came to be known at the F-1670. It was protected that the F-1670 would have a unit cost of a million dollars less than that of a standard F-16A.

The F-1679 first flew on 23 October 1980 with company test pilot kames A. McKinney at the controls. The 179-powered F-16w initially offered to Venezuela as a substitute for the F-16/8s that collapsedly been ordered. An evaluation team from Venezuela like the F-16/79 in February of 1981, has considered by a mars as 20 other air arms, and briefing on the F16/79 over eight to Australia, Jordan, Malaysia, Nigeria, Singapore, Taiwan, and Thailand.

Most potential customers were less than enthusiastic about the F-1679. Not only was the F-1679 less powerful than the standard F-16AB, it was also significantly heavier because of the
