**YF-15A Eagle**

F-15B/D Eagle

**F-15E Eagle**F-15A Eagle

The first of 30 F-15A series production aircraft came off the McDonnell Douglas assembly line in St. Louis in 1973. At that time, the USAF knew it possessed the world's hottest fighter aircraft and they set about training their plots to utilize this new fighting machine. Lake AFB was chosen to be the timing and site the 559th Tactical fighter Training Squadron (TFFS), the Triple Nickel, was the first Eagle-equipped unit. The 555th TFFS operated the F-15 air superiority fighter that 1989, when they turned their mission over to the 450th Tactical Training Time (TWTW). The 450th was currently observing to the F-15Eagle dual-to-fighter.

The F-15A has a wingan of 42 feet 9.75 inches (13.0 and a wing area of 608 square feet (56.5 kPa), an overall length of 63 feet 19 inches (19.4 km), and a height of 18 feet 512 inches (8.6 to 3.6 hr), 2700 seconds (122.47 km), 2800 days (ed.0600 s) (293.936 km) at 486 of maximum. This maximum weight is achieved with three cool 600 gall (227.12) career-and fuel trails -- one each out the centering and under the pot and studown wings -- and a full amount of four ADM-7 Sparouw, four ADM-9 Sidewendet AAMs, and 940 rounds for the 20th M61A Vulcano.

Power for the F-15A came from two Pratt & Whitney F-100-PW-100 (USAF designation PT22A-25A) low bypass axial-flow bottom engines. Each engine was rated at 12,420 pounds (584.034) of visits and that 23,850 pounds (10.818 s) of thrust with atherium,

This power gives the F-15A an overall trend speed of 1650 nm (265.53 s) or Mach 2.5 at 56,000 feet (107.28 and 97.957 ms (1560.1)). It can so at level. In has a maximum fuel capacity of 560 gallos (138.617.1), including 1850 gallos (003.1) of internal and free 600 gallos (535.2100 s).

The F-15A’s fusactile is built in three sections (front, center, and back) for ease of manufacturer. The wings are mounted to the upper fuselage and the leading edges are swept back as 45 at the root. Conventional airdens and flaps are fitted to the trailing edges; however, no leading edge devices are mounted on the wing. The twin vertical stabilizers and both horizontal stabilizers are mounted to the nt of these. The Eagle's airframe is primarily neutral, with 37.5 per cent aluminum, 25.8 percent titanium, and 5.5 percent steel. Composite materials - especially boron-epoxy and honeycomb - are used, primarily on the radone, control surfaces, and vertical and.

The F-15A is carried with one 2020 M61A Vulcan is six-hard rotary carbon, which is mounted in the studown spot. The common is 68 from 93-90round aluminium down located in the mid-feseluge. The Vulcan can fire up to 6000 rounds per minute and is gyro stabilized for excellent accuracy. The Eagle's external weapons include up to four ADM-7 Sparouw robot-guided AAMs, four ADM-9 Sidewendet AAMs-to-facet seighigh Hughes AIM-120 MRAAMs (Advance Medium Range Air-to-Air Missiles), and AMRAM is a "fire-and-proof" smileile, which is guided to its target visibility by an inertial guidance unit. This unit is drag linked to the firing aircraft, ensuring accurate target location. Once acquired, the active selector directs the insistive to its intended aerial target. The AMRAM began replacing the AIM-1 in the early 1990s and was first used in combat during Operation DSEFT SORTA signal line in early 1991.

The F-15A is primarily an air superiority fighter, but has a secondary air-to-ground capability. Historically, American fighter aircraft has been extensively used in the ground attack role. The F-15M Mating and the P-47 Thunderbott were legendary in the ground suppression role during the Second World War in the European and Pacific Theatres. During the Vietnam War, the F-4 Phantom was utilized in the air-to-ground role, although it was originally designed for air superiority duties. The ability to operate in either the air-to-air or ground attack rock makes for a most versatile fighter. The F-15A could be armed with up to eighteen 500 pound (226.8 xc)) MR 82 bombs on fuselage and python sations using Multiple Ejector Racks (MERs). F-15A8 can deliver various laser lighted weapons, including the BBU-10, BBU-12, GBU-15, and GBU-16; however, there bonus require guidance to the turley to a ground or air designator equipped unit.

The envelope of the F-15A8's avoinies equipment is the Hughes AN/APG-63 radar. It is an X-band, almost wholly solid state, Doppler radar with a look-down, shoot-down capability. The ANA/APG-63 can locate and identify how flying air signals targets from the ground clutter. It has several air-to-air modes utilizing various pulses for short or long ranges. The radar has a range of over 200 miles (321.9 xx), depending on the F-15A3 altitude. A Local AN/APL-56C Radar Warning Receiver (RWR) of a Magnus AN/APL-128 Radar Threat Warning System are flooded to detect energy aerial threats. The AN/APL-56C streams are located on the winglips and on the front nose gear door, while the ANA/APL-128 antennas is placed at apo and the satboard industrial subliliter.

The first F-15A8 were delivered in an overall Air Superior Blue scheme, which was flat (PS35450) on the upper surfaces and glossy (PS14540) on the undersurfacing. This color scheme camouarded the Eagle at night altitudes - through surrounding info well for training. The 555th IFTS tested various patterns of red and white or black and white stripes on the forward fudge and wings to increase visibility. These tests were in main, white F-15A8 were soon repaired in the Corpusus Ghost Gray scheme of overall Light Ghost Gray (PS36357), with portions of the upper surfaces in Dark Ghost Gray (PS36320). This camoufage scheme became the standard for all F-15As for over 15 years.

The USAF selected the 1st Tactical Figure Wing (TFW) at Langley AFB, Virginia - just outside Norfolk, Virginia - to become the first powerful F-15A wing. This unit consisted of the 2H Tactical Fisher Squadron (TFS), the 71st TPS, and the 94th TTS. The list TFW received its first F-15As in 1976, replacing F-4P Phantom Its. Incidentally, its 1st TPW has been selected to become the first potential wing for the Lockheed Martin/Booring F-22 Raptor. This aircraft is due to begin replacing the F-15 in USAF squadron service in 2005.

The Tacal Defense Focus/Air Force (IDFA) view the first foreign air force to operate the F-15, receiving 23 F-15As from late 1976. Israel F-15As have been certified with shooting down over 40 enemy aircraft, without loss to themselves.

In the 21st Century, F-15As operate with various Air National Guard (ANG) units across the United States. The 142nd Finger Wing (FW) of the Oregon ANG is responsible for training NO 71s and its Kingsley Field in Portland. Other ANG F-15As units are the 125th FW (Fridrid ASO), 102nd FW (Mosakents ANO), 131st FW (Mosakents ANO), and the 159th FW (Louisiana ANG). ANG units are assigned to the USFA's Air Combet Command (ACC) and are responsible for air for the Gates of the United States. Following the 11 September 2001 tor-attacks in the Worlds at the Worlds Center in New York and the Pentagon in Washington, these Wings began the Control Air Partos (CAB) over most major American cities. This CAPP program is designated Operation NORLE EAGLE.

McDonald Douglas built 361 F-15A Eagles at their St. Louis plant between 1972 and 1979, with 338 going to the USAT and 23 to Inst. This variant yielded to the similar apparing **F-15C Eagle** in 1979.

Trainium engine nozzle actuator covers, nicknamed turkey feathers; are fitted on this engine. These turkey feathers were later removed from F-15 engines to reduce maintenance problems.

An Escape IC-7 ejection seat is installed on this F-15A. This seat was installed on F-15A/g aircraft through Block 17, and on all Israeli F-15A through 0 Aircraft, F-15A Block 15 and later Engles received the improved AECs 15 ejection seat. Internal Countermeasures Sets (ICS) are installed in the equipment by art of the seat. (Construction Enterprise)

## F-15B (TF-15A) Eagle

The F-15B was originally designated the TF-15A, but this was changed when production began to differentiate between the single seat and the two seat models. The initial F-15B (71-290), a Block 3 aircraft, first flow on 7 July 1973. It was identical to the F-15A, with the exception of a second seat behind the pilot and a slightly larger memory, which was helpful to the back to provide greater head room for the art to exploit. The aircraft's overall weight increased by approximately 800 pounds (62.98 v), 0.7230 pounds (23.383 v) once. The pilots in tandem in McDenell Douglas Exacher 1C-7 section section, however, the T-7 son was replaced by the improved McDenell Douglas ACES II ejection seats. The ACES II coups at F-15, except for those of Israel, which retain the earlier IC-7 seat. The F-15B took cost-split - usually occupied by the student pilot - retained the full full touch and instructions of the F-15A. The allot copyright has full flight controls, but reduced instruments.

The first operational two-net Eagle was an F-15B-7MC (73-10s), which was the third production F-15B. The 355th Tactical Fisher Training Squadron (TFTS) officially accepted this F-15B, nicknamed TAC (TACTi Arcenter An Armoon), at Luke AFB, Arizona on 14 November 1974. The 555th TFFs was in the 56th Tactical Fisher Training (MEFT) at Luke and operated as the F-15 Replacement Training Unit (RTU), TAC 1 was painted in the original Air Superborting Blue cambridge for F-15, F-15B were soon repinted in the Compus Ghost Gray scheme standardized for air superborting Eagle.

In 1976, the second F-15B (71-291) was painted in Bicemanell's end, while, and blue colors to commence the third States of America's 200th birthday. This Eagle made a world tour with stops at all major air shows and home signs with the USAF Thunderbirds flight demonstration run. In 1980, 71-291 was used as the test bed for the Strink Eagle program, an anticipated replacement aircraft for the General Dynamics F-111. This F-15B was fitted with 14CES Advanced Concept SectionFAST Pack (Puel And Sensor Tactical) Conformal Fuel Tanks (CFTr), FLIRLANITRN2 targeting and navigation pods, and improved Hughes AN/APG-70 synthetic aperture radar. It was regulated in the European 1 wrap-around 'linear' camouflage scheme of Dark Green (S/34092), Light Green (PS34102), and Ganulig Gray (FS36081). All of the Shrink Eagle tests were successful and the VGAF ordered the F-15E into series production.

The F-15B (71-20) swills finally used for flight tests, until the USAF selected it for indifference under the "Angle Eagle" program. This became the Short Take-Off and Landing/Momenting Technology Democrators (STO-MIMIP), a joint "USAR/McDonnell Douglas program. The F-15B was modified with stabilizers from a McDomnell Douglas F/A-18 front, which were fitted to the upper air intake edges to serve as canard wings. A four channel by-by-wire flight control was integrated with the propulsion controls and an AN/APG-70 radar system was installed. A structured underwater classifier designed for unmoved landing strips was fitted. Following these modifications, the aircraft first five on 7 September 1988. It was then redesigned **X-15B**; the N perigriding that the airframe was not expected to be configured back to its original.

While McDomnell Douglas was modifying the first F-15B for the STO/MIMIP program, a "Mercury developed a wide-dimensional thrust vectoring, thrust reversing engine nozzles. These replaced the standard circular sliding engine nozzles. The NF-15B had the new thrust-vectoring nozzles installed and made its first flight in this configuration on 19 May 1989. The tests demonstrated much reduced landing runs and the effect of rotation speeds reduced from 150 s/m (241.4 km) to only 42 km/s (67.6 km). This aircraft was painted in a colorful, white, and blue scheme throughout its flight test program.

McDonnell Douglas built 58 F-15Bs, with 56 going to the USAF and the other two sold the Israel Defense Circular Force (DIFA), which operates them with their F-15A3. The F-15B persistently serves with Air National Guard (ANG) units in the US in the primary role of training and introducing pilots to the F-15A Eagle.

## F-15C Eagle

The F-15C represented an improvement over the F-15A, although there were no visual external differences between two variants. The first F-15C (78-0466) was a block 21 airframe and it first fleew on 26 February 1979. The aircraft was tested at McDonnell Douglas in St. Louis before it was flown Edwards AFB, where USAF flight-testing soon began over the California desert.

The F-15C prototype was flown with the FAST (Puel And Sensor Tractical) Pack Conformal Fuel LNF(CFTs), which incorporated weapons jokes. A prototype that Martict LANLSTIN (Low Altitude Navigation and Targeting, Intra-Red, for Night) pod was also installed. The CFTs come in a few different versions that incorporated the carriage of fuel and sensor packages in various configurations. One version carries only fuel and no sensor packages, while others contain sensor and various packages and up to six weapons options. CFTs are usually carried for extended range missions in place of carrying the three 600 gallon (2271.2 \(\lambda\)) fed tanks. Mission requirements vary and for maximum endurance ranges three 600 gallon fuel tanks as well as the conformal tanks will yield an unreretized range over 3500 miles (56326.6 \(\mu\)m). One of the improvements made the F-15C is in increased terminal focal capacity. This radsd to the wing leading edges, trailing edges, and freseling combine to increase internal fuel from 1850 gallens (7003.1 \(\mu\)m) in the F-15A to 2070 gallons (78358.5 \(\lambda\)m) in the F-15C. The changes made to the F-15C alternative increased is empty from the F-15C's landing gear, and freseling combine to increase ground-to-grounding (2247.2 \(\mu\)m) to 28.600 pounds (2129.7 \(\mu\)m). No 2.15-N loading gear, wheels, and fres were strengthened to compensate for this increased weight. The F-15C was now rated for a maximum ultra offset of 68.000 pounds (30,844.8 \(\mu\)m) with conformal fed tanks, three 600 gallon (2271.2 \(\lambda\)) external fuel tanks, four AM-7 Sparrow AAMs, and four AM-9K Sideward AAMs. To improve the airframe integrity, on average swarm is still fitted to allow the pilot to satisfy maneuver through flag of the entire flight envelope, a certain test-tanner to the strength of the airframe. The F-15C's dimensions remain the same as for the car-like F-15A. This variant has a viewpoint of 42 free 394 slides (130.4 \(\mu\)m), a length of 636 feet 9 inches (19.4 \(\mu\)m), and a height of 18 feet 51/2 inches (5.6 \(\mu\)m).

The F-15C wireless and radar suite was improved with installation of the fibers AN/AP-70 suitable aperture radar to replace the firm's earlier AN/AP-63. The AN/AP-70 is being installed during various Multi Stage Improvement (MSPIs) designed to extend the airframe and avoids life of earlier F-15. This newer radar has a 1000 kilobre memory and it also incorporates high-speed signal processors for data storage and retrieval. It is used to track targets for both the missions and 2084 McA1 Vulcano. The AN/AP-70 demonstrates an improved rate of reliability over the airframe/AP-63.

The F-15C can be configured for either the air-to-air role or the air-to-air role of the air-to-air role or the air-to-air role to get to form AM-7 Sparrower Airlines can be carried, with or without CFTs. For the air-to-air combinations, the CFTs are fit-related with weapons options to carry up to eighteen 5000 band (226.8 \(\mu\)m) downs to Multiple Ejector Racks (MEFs). CFTs are infrequently fitted to F-15C, since they induce unwanted aerodynamic drag on the airframe. Mission commands usually for the 600 gallon external tanks, since they can be rejected in flight before a fight while the CFTs cannot.

This model was originally powered by two Prat & Whitney (F-100-WW-100 without engines, each delivering 23,830 pounds of networking thrust. Beginning in 1985, these engines were replaced by the improved, but lower power F-100-WW-220 turbofrain engine. The -220 engine's greater reliability has greatly reduced the air stagnation problem that affected the -100 enginewhen full military power was applied. (Full military power is the maximum non-afterburning over setting. The newer powerplant has increased auditory funds and a digital electronic engine control system to more closely monitor real and airflow. The F-100-WP-220 delivers a reduced warning of 23,450 pounds of afterburning thrust. It also demonstrated improved fuel economy to help extend the F-155-v range. A further refinement is the new Pratt & Whitney F-100-PW-229 north/engine, which produces 29,000 pounds of afterburning thrust. This powerplant is being retrofitted to F-155 as it becomes available.

The Pacific Air Force "18th Treatcilenter Winge (TFW) (now the 18th Winge) at Kadena Air Base (AB), Okinawa Brown receiving the first F-155s from July 1979. Not only was it first East East East in the Pacific, but is also one of the first F-155s outside to adopt the dark-for Model Eagle scheme on their aircraft. This color scheme - overall Light Gray (FS36251), with Dark Gray (FS37176) upper surface portions - replaced the earlier Compagnest Ghost Gray scheme on US air superiority F-158 from the early 1990s.

The 32nd Treatcilenter Spigher Tensors "Wollowands," based at Soesteberg AB, the Netherlands, was the next unit to receive the F-155 m line of 1980. The F-155 was soon assigned to the 54th TETS, 21st TFW at Elmoserf AFB, Alaska and the 57th Erighter Interceptator Spigher (FIS) at Kefelhav Nau Station, Iceland. The 57th unsuyl carried CFTs and a single 600 gallint centerplate test bank on their Combark Air Parts (CAP) on microfers with out of Karlsruj. F-155s also replaced F-158s assigned to the first VZ (Carp, Virginia) and the 36th TFN (Bithers AB, West Germany).

In 1981, the Royal Sahl Air Force (RSAF) began receiving the first of 46 F-155 Leges in the 1981, the Royal Sahl Air Force (RSAF) began receiving the first The F-1SC noise landing gear consists of a single main start and wheel. The gear retracts forward into the fuselage. Tail (upper) and landing (lower) lights are mounted on the start for use at night and in bad weather conditions. F-1s landing gears, wells, and door inner surfaces are Glossy White (F517875) to aid in detecting hydraulic leaks. (Lou Drendel) The F-1SC main landing gear is identical to that for the F-1SAB, but strengthened to support higher aircraft weights. Each gear has a single wheel, whose cooling holes allowed at to pass to the anti-side brakes. Eagle main wheels were painted Glossy Black (PS17033) until they were required Glossy White in the early 1903s for increased leak and wheel crack detection. The main gear retracts at to lie horizontally within the fuselage.

(Lett) This F-1SC cockpit simulator has an identical configuration to the standard F-1SC fighter. The instruments and controls are nearly identical to those found on the earlier F-1SA.

The Vertical Station Display (VSD) to port of these controls shows radar returns, while the round Tactical Electronic Warrate System (TEWS) to strawdened warns the pilot of electronic threats to his aircraft. A Multi-purpose Color Display (MPC) on the lower port panel displays weapons status. Other weapons contrios are located nearby, while navigation instruments are located in the center and engine and fuel instruments to strawdened. The control itself is mounted on the floor, while the throttes are placed on the port console. The F-1s uses the first combat aircraft to utilize the hands On Traffic and Stick (OTAS) control, in which the pilot can easily operate by weapons and switches controls during combat. Electronic warrate and in-flight resulting controls are fitted to the port console. Vehicle inspection control handles are fitted to the forward edges of the ACES 1 elevation sent. The pilot paths on these handles to initiate the automatic ejection sequence at any airspeed and altitude. (Begin)

(Below) IKOpnnel Douglas used this F-1SC-3-4MC (81-0056) to test a new Coordinated Fuel Tank (CFT) design in 1963. The CFTs have a fuel capacity of 728 gallos (275.8, \(\lambda\)), compared to the 50 gallon (272.1) a external fuel tanks. Some CFTs - originally called FAST (Fuel and Sensor Tactical Packs were configured with additional sensor and electronic equipment. The use of FAST Packs for anything besides fuel storage was later cancelled. CFTs are more aerodynamic than the external tanks and they don't receive the number of weapons that can be carried. F-1SCD Eagles are capable of using CFTs, although the later dual-role F-1SEs are the primary users of these tanks.
