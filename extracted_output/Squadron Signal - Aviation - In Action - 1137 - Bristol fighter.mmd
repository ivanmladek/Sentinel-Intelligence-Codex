This Bristol F.2B (C-4011) was the tenth of a batch of 300 F.288 built by the British & Colonial Aircraft Company (Bristos) with Rolts-Royce Falcon engines. C4728, an identical aircraft from the same production batch was sent to the British Aviation Mission, in Washington D.C. for the United States Air Service (USAS).

Introduction

In 1916 it became clear that a replacement for the BE2 series of reconnaissance aircraft was urgently needed. As a result, two designs were produced, the REB by the Royal Aircraft Factory and the R.2A by Bristols. The latter design was unusual in that it had the wooden box-type fuselage mounted in between the upper and lower wings (known as a mid-gap mounting) to minimize the restricted view over the upper wing which was a problem faced by the plot in a more conventional layout. A second, revised variant which was power by a 150 bp Hispano-Suzia engine with unequal-spin wings was designated for R.2B. This, in turn, gave way to a variant with the new Rolls-Royde FalconI temple.

This new aircraft was later redesignated as the E.2A, since the new design was now considered a fighter/recomnaissance type and an order for two prototypes (serials A303-A3304) and fifty production variants (A3303 to A335) was placed by the War Office. The chief feature of this variant was a straight upper loergone coupled with two ul/slic-mounted "car" radiators, and in this form the aircraft made its first flight on 9 September 1916. This was closely followed by the first flight of the second prototype, which was powered by a 150 bp Hispano-Suzia engine with a circular one mounted around and was equipped with a tail skid built into the base of the rudder. Within a short time it was determined that the slide mounted radiators obscured the pilots forward view and A3303 was rebuilt with a rose mounted circular radiator and a deeper nose cowling. The armament at this time consisted of a single Vickers.303 machine gun synchronized to fire through the propeller. It was intended to fit the observers' cockpit with a single Lewis gun, however, the mounting had yet to be decided. The first prototype underwent official tests between 16 and 18 October 1916, and was tested with both a four and two blade propeller.

The fifty production FalconI 1 powered F.2A was delivered to No 48 Squadron RFC during December of 1916. These aircraft were fitted with a Scarf ring in the rear cockpit for a.303 Lewis machine gun and had the armer plated pilotlets set used on the prototypes deleted. No 48 Squadron deployed to France in March of 1917 after a period of training at Redenborne. The Squadron did not see action until the Battle of Arms in April of 1917, in order to achieve maximum surprise. These aircraft, however,sated standard two seat fighter tactics which favored the gunner and, as a result, the squadron's first patrol of six aircraft which crossed the front lines on 5 April, was was wasayed mainly by the Albuross Dills flown by Manfred von Richthofen and four other pilots of _Jagdifield 11_, and only two of the Bristols survived.

Even with this over showing, a further two handed F.2A were ordered. The aircraft were modified with longer spin ulplanes and a distinct isotope to the upper loergone in the region of the cockpit. The first 150 aircraft were powered by the Falcon I and the next fifty (serials A725-1700) being powered by the 220 bp FalconI engine which were fitted with radiator shattners to help coototot the temperature of the engine. These machines were designated as the Bristol F.2B and this became the main production variant of the aircraft that became known to the pilots of the Royal Flying Corps as the Bristol Fisher.

A3303 on the grass at Upvonen after it was modified with the round radiator and deeper south. At this time the aircraft had no gun mounting in the observer's cockpit. It has also been filled with a two blade propeller in place of the earlier four blade propeller.

Bristol F.2B

As production of the F.2B increased in tempo during the mid-Summer of 1917, additional Royal Flying Corps expansions were formed or re-equipped with the new Bristol fighter, including Nos 48, 62, 88, 11, 20 and 22. The production F.2B featured a reduced chordlet tailplane with longer given elevators. These were later changed to use the elevators of the F.2A with the ultimate of the F.2B and this arrangement was retained for all wartime F.2B.

The F.2B benefited from the lessons learned from the first combat use of the F.2A variants. When introduced in combat they were flown in action using single seat fighter tactics, which immediately proved successful.

The aircraft was aimed with a single synchronised.303 Vickers machine gun with 963 rounds of ammunition in the nose for the pilot and a.303 Lewis machine gun for the observer with seven 97ound ammunition forms. Some aircraft were presumed in the field with an additional Lewis gun mounted over the wing to augment the forward firepower and twin Lewis guns in the rear couldn mounted on a Santiff.

The increased production rate at Bristolfs for the F.2B resulted in a shortage of engines since Rolls-Royce was unable to keep pace with the demand for Falcon engines. As a result, alternative engines were examined and tested, including the Sidberg-Wilson, Arison-Silia 200 H, Higbinson-Souza 200 H, Higbinson-Souza 200 and 200 DuSpo Namph. The Suburban Arab being finally chosen, although others continued to be tested since the Arab equipped variants proved to be somewhat under-powered. The installation of the Arab engine altered the nose contours and exhaust stack arrangement.

Before the end of the First World War, the Bristol fighter was to see service in various cheaters of war, including with No 139 in Italy and No 67 (Australian) Spudrone, in the

**This F.2B (A710) was powered by a 100 bp Rolls Royce Falcon 1 engine and was part of the first production batch. This contract was for two hundred F.2B8, 150 with Falcon 1 engines and fifty with the 220 bp Falcon 1 engine.**Middle East. Nos 33, 36, 39, 76 and 141 Squadrons used Bristol Fighters for home defense duties. F.2Bs used by home defense units as nightgighters were modified in a number of ways. Some were fitted with navigation lights on the lower wing tips and radders, Holt flare brackets beneath each lower wing tip and illuminated gun splits. Other nightgillters were fitted with additional forward fling machine guns, one aircraft of No 39 Home Defense Squadron had two Lewis guns fitted over the wing in addition to its normal single Vickers gun and twin kevis guns for the observer. By November of 1918 over 5,500 Bristol fighters, mainly F.2Bs, had been ordered and, of these, 3,101 had been taken into the RFC and AF. Although the Armusice led to cancellation of some orders, the "Bif" as it was known to wartime aimen, continued to be manufactured until September of 1919, with a total of 4,747 being produced. **(Left)** The 230 hp Sunbeam Arab engine differed from the Falcon in a number of ways including the use of front, side mounted raulator shutters and a revised exhaust system with a long down sloping exhaust stack. **This Falcon I powered F.2B (A7105) was built by the British and is known to have been at No 8 Aircraft Acceptance Park, at Lynpone during 1917. At one it had been assigned to No 48 Squadron, Royal Flying Corps (PFC) in France.**This F-2B (C8837) was the second of a batch manufactured by the Gloucestershire Aircraft Company. It came to this untilmey end at Sarrewhen, while assigned to No 12 Squadron and flown by LT Hughes. The aircraft had previously been assigned to another Squadron where it had been coded C-4.

To solve the engine shortage problem, an number of F.288 were tested during the war years with different engines. This F.28 (B1200) at the experimental establishment at Maristham Beath in September of 1918 was powered by a 200 by Wolsey Viper liquid cooled engine.

F.2B Mk II

With the end of the "near to end all war", as the First World War was commonly called and believed to be, the Bristol F.2B underwent a change of role. No longer capable of the fristhe fighter mission, the Royal Air Force began using the aircraft in its many oversenses as an Army Cooperation two-setzer commissionance and close support aircraft. To meet the requirements of this new mission, a number of modifications were incorporated into the F.2B.

In a five year long rebuilding program, some 415 aircraft were reconditioned by Bristol and used to RAF until its such locations as Iraq, the northwest frontier of India and Balubistan. These areas were provided by F.2B and to make the aircraft fit for desert use an enlarged tradition with an increased number of radiator shutters, improved coating systems and "fare" tries to cope with the harsh conditions at desert landing fields (latter turbo understages) were installed.As with other F.2A, the M. II had the capability of carrying up to twelve 200 Cooper fragmentation bombs on cracks installed under the lower wings.

Other M.3 Its reserved with four house based Army Co-operation squadrons which were termed with "Brisifts", as the type was now popularly known. A number of these aircraft were usually fitted with message retrieval books mounted under the fuselage. These books could be lowered to using messages string between two poles by ground units that were not equipped with radio equipment.

U.S. Bristols

On the personal recommendation of GEN Persishing, plans were proposed for the construction of the Bristol F.2B in the United States. These aircraft were intended to be powered by the 200 hp Hispano-Suzia engine and a pattern aircraft (serial A7207) arrived at the Smithsonian Institute, Washington D.C. on 1 August 1991. Unfortunately for the program, COI, V.E. Clark, redesigned the aircraft so that the job helped meiguel code led installed. This engine turned out to be totally unsuitable and led to a great many problems with early U.S. built F.2B.

At this same time, a contract for 1,000 aircraft had been placed with the Fisher Body Corporation, but this was soon realized to the Curtis Aeropae de Motor Company and the number of aircraft on order doubled to some 2,000 aircraft. The first aircraft, designated the 0-1, was delivered on 25 January 1918, although it did not fly until 5 March. In all, twenty-five forgotten O-1s were delivered,with an additional two prototypes, before the contract was cancelled. The cancellation came after two crashes that were found to be due to faulty workmanship and another law was blamed on pilot error. These crashes had unjustly given the F.2B a bad reputation in the United States.

While these events were taking place, the original pattern aircraft (A7207) had been re-fitted with the only existing American-built 300 hp Hispano-Suzia engine (being redesign and the 3-9) which was second British-built pattern aircraft had arrived being designated of the 3-9) which was first shifted with a 280 hp Library's engine for comparison with a similar number of aircraft powered by Hispano-Suzia engines to (be known as B-2 and B-1s respectively).

Unfortunately, before the tests could be completed, the original model was damaged in a storm necessitating a complete rebuilding program during which Browning machine guns were fitted in place of the Martin gas and the new designation XB-1a adopted. Following tests at McCock Field in early July of 1919 a small production program was started.

This XB-1a, No 151, carries its serial number A.S. 94108 on the fuselage side and had an enlarged fuel tank over the upper wing center section. The XB-1a was to be armed with twin forward firing Browning machine guns in the fuselage upper decoding.

Foreign Service

Following the Armistic a number of surplus Bristol F.2Bs were sold abroad. During 1922, five reconditioned airframes were sold to Norway while eight Polish Rooye Falcon powered aircraft were purchased by the Irish Free State. These were followed by an additional six new production aircraft during 1925.

A country in urgent need of military aircraft during this period, was Poland, which was emerging as an independent state and engaged in a war with neighboring Russia. To meet Poland's immediate requirements over one hundred Bristol F.2Bs were ordered for delivery.

every during 1920. The first machines of the type going into action 01 August. Eventually three Polish squadows were equipped with F.2B-and mainly used in the reconnaissance role.

Two years later Greece bought six standard Bristol F.2Bs in 1923 Belgium bought fifteen machines powered by 300 Hghemo-Suzia engines. These were purchased from the Aircraft Disposal company and were followed by sixteen new production machines bought directly from Bristols. These had the same power plants but were configured with ferric type asileros and close undercharges. A license was also obtained to construct the F.2B in Belgium and forty were produced during 1925. These were modified with horn-balanced radders but were otherwise similar to the earlier aircraft and some were used for the training role.

Other F.2Bs in the post-war years went to Canada and New Zealand. Small number also were used by China (for service with Sun Yat Sen's rekid air fores). Mexico obtained a number of aircraft (reportedly ten) while the pair originally obtained by Spain (6510 and 6512) were later augmented by no additional aircraft, all being fitted with deep type undercharges. Friee airlocess and 300 Hghemo-Suzia engines.

The majority of Bristol Fighters which were purchased by foreign air fores were standard F.2Bs. The longest lived of these were the two examples that continued to serve with the Royal New Zealand Air Force until one year before the outbreak of the Second World War!Post-War Service

With the establishment of the Royal Air Force on a peacetime basis, the Bristol F.28 was adopted to be the services standard Army Co-operation machine. First tested in December of 1919, the F.28 MB II was modified to carry a wide range of desert equipment and had a cooling system suitable for tropical climates. A total of over four hundred similar aircraft were subsequently issued to overseas RAF squadtors, operating in such areas as Palestine, Egypt, India and Turkey.

At home four units were equipped with F.28-B for work in collaboration with the Army. One unit was talked with communication duties and was the only F.28 unit based in the British files that was equipped for the spectacular role of picking up messages suspended between two poles on the ground for collection by aircraft.

Although the envisaged use of the Bristol F.28 as a carrier based aircraft was abandoned, tests were carried out aboard HMS EAGLE and one aircraft (F4453) made a number of deck landing aboard the carrier.

Production continued until 1920, with all subsequent F.28 variants (MR III and IV) being conversions from earlier production machines. The Royal Air Force finally retired its last F.28 during 1932.

This F.2B has used in experimental work with the Caltchorp A-1 parachute. The parachutes were stored in externally mounted bins on the fuselage underside and static line operated.

The external storage of the Caltchorp A-1 parachute was necessary due to its static line operation. The two bins each held a single parachute, one for the pilot and one for the observer. The rope running from the parachute to the cockpit was attached to the crew-man's harness.

This F.2B at Waddon, Croydon during September of 1921 has been converted to a three set routing aircraft (on1611). The aircraft carries a Spanish civil registration and represents one of several unusual conversations of surplus F.2B that were common on the civil market during the immediate post First World War period. The aircraft carries the Bristol copy logo on the vertical file in White. The registration is believed to have been Black against a White background.

E.2581 was powered by a Rolly Ryove Falcon III liquid cooled engine. The small hole in the middle of the upper nose is the gun port for the pilot's 303 Vickers machine gun. This preserved aircraft is unusual in that it has a small spiner on the propeller hub which carries a copper star design.

For many years it flow in the color scheme carried by F.2Bds during the late 19th30s, overall Silver Dope with Gray coupling. The serial was carried on the rear trusting in Black and across the rudder stripes in Black outlined in White. There is a tight restriction on the aircraft, it can not be shown single seat without putting baliest in the rear occupied to make up for the weight of the second crewman.This display was put on at Bedfordshire, England during the 1970s.

D0808 was restored to flying condition by Bristol during 1950. The aircraft had previously been owned by CAPT C. P. Boglive who bought it during 1933/34. The F.28 originally entered service during June of 1918 and went through several rebuilds seeing service as both a kit and kit. Itoday the aircraft is flying in its original warting PC 10 finish.

## RAF Museum F.2B Display

Another F.2B is on permanent displays in the Royal Air Force Museum at Hendon, just outside London as part of the Museum's First World War collection. This aircraft was rebuilt from the parts of six aircraft that were found near a barn at RAF Weston-on-the-Green, Oxfordshire. One of the affirms was acquired by the RAF Museum and formed the basis for restoration. During 1979, the airframe was moved to the museum's restoration facility at Carlanton and a collection of F.2B components was started. It was decided that the aircraft would be restored to represent E2466, an F.2B Brown by CAPT W.F. J. Harvey of No 22 Squadron, who provided detailed notes on his aircraft.

Copies of the original Bristol drawings were used to assist in the restoration. The amount that acquisition of an original Rolf-Royce Falcon engine was impossible. Using a 275 h Falcon III on loan from the Shuttleworth Collection as a pattern, a replica was made in metal. Along with the engine, a new radiator, cowling, and oil tank were manufactured in the restoration facility.

The museum was able to locate original sets of wings and these were found to be in very good condition with little of the wood needing to be replaced. The wings were completely disassembled and checked to ensure that all joints were sound. The ultimate was original as was the fin and made.

One departure from the original F.2B was the tires, since actual tries proved to be impossible to obtain and larger size tires had to be used for the display aircraft. The aircraft is finished in the colves and markings of CAPT Harvey's aircraft as well as his kill markings which include the destruction of three observation halloons.

For display, part of the fuselage fabric was left off to reveal the after/s interior. E2466 had a armmer modification and carried an additional 303 inch Lewis machine gun installed on the upper wing center section. This gun was added for use in balloon hosting missions. The rest of the armament is identical to early F.2Bs with a single forward fringe Vickers machine gun in the cowling and a single Lewis gun in the rear cockpit.
