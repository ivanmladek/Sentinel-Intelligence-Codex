{"text": "### The dynamics of archaic meetings and its imprint in stone Meetings and involvement with neighboring groups, or between clans with longer distances apart, created social networks and contact lines throughout the landscape.A thought experiment may bring life into what such contact lines might represent. If the Scandinavian peninsula is imagined as a scene of past social traffic, we may envisage a single person and his or her life track (cf. Damm 2010). Thus, within a specific milieu of technologies, materialities and meanings, a person is born and incorporates their knowledge within various social settings. The settings of the ongoing situations of a life course would also follow a geographical route. The dwelling places or 'localities' of local landscapes would be basic, and form the background for excursions beyond this immediate social and geographical sphere. Furthermore, this person, in line with anthropological terminology described as _Ego_**,** will be born into some kind of social universe of kinship categories. Throughout the Mesolithic and Early Neolithic, kinship systems would have varied greatly. Depending on this variation, Ego's position in such a system is decisive for his or her life course. Some systems carry quite well-defined rules of rights and obligations towards other kin members, whereas others may be more open. Any system will, to a certain extent, however, contain norms and recommendations about who one may marry, and this factor is involved in Stone Age social dynamics. Marrying is part of the sharing of goods and giving of gifts to persons and groups dwelling in other landscapes than the one of Ego. The micro level of a society's social traffic and dynamics of gift exchange could be imagined through Ego's movement in space throughout his or her life course. The Ego of the period under study together formed a network of lines of contact and travel. An imagined mapping of contacts across Mesolithic and Early Neolithic peninsular Scandinavia would create a complex palimpsest of overlapping and intercrossing lines. Furthermore, an imagined digital animation of lines of movements and contacts would show the dynamics of change throughout the period. The complex web of \"moving\" and changing networks would be made up of lines representing one Ego's movement. Probably most of these Ego would spend their lives in the natal social and physical context, or among the geographically closest group. However, some persons and groups would have travelled further distances to seek out other groups.  Such traveling may have taken place on very differing schedules. For some groups and persons, long-distance traveling was perhaps an annual occasion; to others, it may have been a once-in-a-lifetime event. Longer and shorter travels and meetings have involved gift exchange and situations of more or less constant debt; these have strengthened the rationale of getting together. There would potentially be an enduring desire and motivation for traveling to, or receiving visits from other groups, or the seeking of a common venue shared by several groups. This urge to come together, its realization and results, are a basic assumption of this work, as it is seen to have formed the basis of much of the dynamics of Late Mesolithic history. The logic of meetings is simultaneously to be regarded as inscribed within the cycles of temporal rhythms, i.e. the change of seasons and the meanings and belief systems related to them, as they are preserved in the rock art panels at the great meeting venues. Here, groups were sharing and exchanging goods and people. Moreover, meetings created settings in which unity, as well as differences, between the present groups was confronted. Thus, 'culture' was exchanged as knowledge in the broadest sense was invented, introduced and remade. A meticulous enquiry into the styles and (de)signs of Scandinavian hunters' rock art reveal how currents of ideology-laden local symbols in some cases appear outside of their context, i.e. at faraway sites. Thus, the crossings of a great number of Stone Age Egos would seem literally to be written in stone and lines of archaic contact are materially available for archeological investigation. This way, the awareness of meetings creates a framework for understanding the shared, yet local expressions of the prehistoric mind."}
{"text": "### Sketching the approaches Stone Age Scandinavia was inhabited by hunting societies whose minds incorporated a specific conceptual world.A fragment of this world is expressed in artifacts referred to as _hunters' rock art_. The research object of this book is the hunters' rock art of the Scandinavian peninsula during the Mesolithic and into the Early Neolithic. One general objective is to study the totality of available source material, with the aim of investigating whether such a holistic approach may reveal until now unknown connections and relationships between sites and regions. Certainly, the present work has the \"meaning of rock art\" at its core. More specifically, however, the theoretical approaches and analytical devices applied originates in a constellation of a number of parallel strands of interests. Some of these interests provide the  _specific approaches_ to this body of rock art, whereas others are  the precondition and _implications_ of results from the empirical study using this approach. I will shortly comment on these two aspects and how they unite in a collection of related topics and approaches. Current anthropological discourse suggests two main, but internally different, conceptual schemata of perception to be attributed to hunters-fishers-gatherers, namely that of _animism_ and _totemism_. This book pursues an understanding of Nordic rock art through animic and totemic ontologies, including potential dynamics between the two schemas of perception. Recently, the concepts of animism and totemism have undergone revision and reappraisal (e.g. Bird-David 1999; Descola 2013; Harvey 2006; Ingold 2000). One basic outset of the work presented here is the recognition that the animic-totemic divide may serve as a device to explain some cardinal differences within the total record of Mesolithic rock art. However, and as will become apparent, this occasions a _special focus on the Late Mesolithic segment_ of the total material. The great difference in question is connected to animal figures decorated with diverse types of line and square patterns inside of their bodies in contrast to the animals drawn in outline only. The concepts of animism and totemism, as they were initially applied to the material (see Fuglestvedt 2008a; 2010; 2011), seemed to me to be a promising explanatory device. Thus it forms the outset for further analysis of the realmof Mesolithic rock art. However, while endeavoring to understand totemism, I was led to reconsider the concept as it was expounded by Levi-Strauss (1962a; 1966). My renewed interest in his works entailed an appropriation of the concept of the bricoleur, in turn leading to a reappraisal of the concept of _mind_. The 'human mind' thus forms the basic tenet for my understanding of the nature of Mesolithic rock art in Scandinavia. Claiming this is certainly not denying the fact that rock art is rooted in rituals or trance, or that its compositions are connected to landscape conceptions, cosmology or mythology. Not at all; my point is rather that these approaches, despite their indisputable value, still do not explain what rock art really is on the very basic level. The mentioned approaches produce knowledge about the context and background of rock art, but do not seek their basic origins, that is, in humanness. My application of 'the human mind' pursues such an origin as it is expressed through the context of the Nordic Mesolithic. Obviously, the mind-concept is totally at odds with current discourse in archaeology and anthropology; still, my conviction is that Scandinavian archaeology abandoned this inspiration before its potential had been sufficiently investigated. It seems that the concept of mind became unfortunately inextricably linked with Levi-Strauss's language metaphor, which, in turn, had got too closely aligned with the theories of Ferdinand Saussure. Among other twentieth-century philosophers, the latter served as inspiration for the archaeological interest in \"reading material culture\" as text (Tilley 1990a). For Scandinavian rock art in particular, the scholarly endeavor of applying concepts from the syntax structure of a text was intellectually demanding - also to the reader - and while certainly producing interesting results (Hesjedal 1990; Tilley 1991), I am not convinced that the concept of text really captured the nature of visual expressions. It is surprising though, that what came to be Levi-Strauss's second, and even more important analogical figure, namely the _music_ metaphor, was never embraced by archaeologists. This work will pursue an understanding of rock art through the analogy of music. Rock art as part of the workings of the human mind will form the outset of my approach for understanding the nature of this type of Mesolithic artifact. This approach may appear to be an all too general principle, however, and as hopefully will become clear throughout the chapters of Part I, the concepts of mind cannot be understood detached from a context, which in this case is the northern European Mesolithic. The investigation of the Mesolithic mind in rock art, I claim, is fully compatible with studying animism and totemism. In fact, the \"products\" of the mind in rock art may be derived from both animic and totemic approaches to the environment. Thus, in Part II animism and totemism will be elaborated on and discussed with a special regard to how they may serve as heuristic devices for understanding the rock art of this particular context. This investigation aims at understanding which of the Mesolithic landscapes are imprinted by a totemic palimpsest, and which \"remain\" animic. Evidence from rock art alone suggests that in this phase of prehistory, \"social entities\", and presumably normative groups, were established and dispersed in different areas and regions. Results and conclusions in Parts I and II imply that for the Late Mesolithic, meetings and contact between groups living at various distances apart have taken place. Certainly, the presumed existence of meetings is a precondition for this work, but is also an assumption that turned out to be supported by the archaeological record, when investigated. The present book addresses the possibility that some inter-group meetings involved very long journeys. Such a scenario leads straight to issues of alliance making and gift-exchange, and for addressing the epitome of 'woman-as-gift'. These topics will be addressed in Part III. In other words, this approach allows us to reach an understanding of the Late Mesolithic as a period in which the creation of inter-group bonds were created. This in turn provides us with some new devices to understand the historical conjunctures of the Mesolithic; it achieves my goal to go \"beyond rock art\" and draw it into the context of social history of the Mesolithic."}
{"text": "### The meeting of minds Addressing the Stone Age mind does not involve a disregard of bodies.An effective way of explaining this could be to give an example taken from a famous discussion of shamanic curing provided by Levi-Strauss in _Structural Anthropology I_ , which tells of a woman in labor. The woman experiences terrible pain and is assisted by a shaman, who succeeds in chasing away the terror of fear and ache. In treating the woman, he portrays her body as a landscape of which some parts are invaded by malevolent powers. By playing upon a collectively shared mythic language, the shaman performs an incantation that places the woman and her pains within the world myth and to powers belonging to cosmic reality. The curing process creates a transition from \"the most prosaic reality to myth, from the physical universe to the physiological universe, from the external world to the internal body\" (Levi-Strauss 1963: 193). Thus, the woman's body is narrated - and perceived - as the battleground for a struggle between named and personified malicious and good spirits, and the final rescue from the former. The end of the story is the end of her pain and reinstates the woman and her body within a sensible world. It is important to note the fact that she, similar to the shaman, does not doubt the veracity of the mythic reality that is being staged. At first glance, the people involved may seem somewhat innocent or ingenuous. However, as this example just represents a variety of what we know to be psychological manipulation, it should be acknowledged that a psychiatric curing process in our modern world is principally the same. Here, the successful curing process likewise bases itself on myths, with the difference that the stories are not part of the collectively shared material, but are instead created on the personal level. The preceding incidence of shamanic healing is derived from a longer discussion (Levi-Strauss 1963: 167-205), also including the named Kwakiutl shaman Quesalid. Citing this example, I want to bring attention back to symbols,for _symbols_ in their primeval context, _are effective_.  Certainly a \"metaphor can change the world\" (Levi-Strauss 1963: 186-205, 202). In a prehistoric setting, they work within the realm of a collectively shared reality. This is also a sensuous reality. Thus, symbols really matter. They create somatic experiences, and somatic experiences create symbols realized in rock art. Rock art is not a mere representation of an already existing cosmography. Rather, this expressive and intellectual activity contributes to the making and remaking of the world as a meaningful whole; it involves the invention of new symbols based on what is at hand already in the symbolic environments of the Mesolithic. Regarding styles and ways of depicting figures, Scandinavian hunters' rock art is both homogeneous and heterogeneous at the same time. Thus, somehow, the \"environments\" in question are linked together in some kind of symbolic unity. Ultimately, the total body of Mesolithic rock art is the manifestations of incorporated and interconnected meeting minds. Certainly, \"Mesolithic minds\" were embodied persons of flesh and blood, but the totality of their expression points to a super-individual level of meaning belonging to the collectively and historically inherited world. This is what I call the _Mesolithic mind_.  The mind concept implies that areas of the intellectuality expressed in Mesolithic art belong to unconscious areas of the minds of its creators. According to Levi-Strauss, the unconscious areas of the distant mind constitutes its objective reality, and as such, aspects of its meaning are accessible to the anthropologist - if not on an immediate level, but through analytical enquiry. I chose an analytical application of 'the mind' because it turned out to bring my understanding of rock art to new realms of meaning."}
{"text": "### Location in time This work examines rock art dated to the Mesolithic period.It also covers the transition into the Neolithic period, tentatively the first 300-500 calendar years. This implies that the study addresses rock art from the time of the earliest post-glacial settlers and slightly into the period of the Comb ware and Funnel beaker cultures. The very last phase also covers the earliest traces of slate-using groups on the Scandinavian peninsula. This corresponds to the time span dating from the beginning of the Early Mesolithic, throughout all of the Mesolithic phases as well as the _earliest_ Early Neolithic. This corresponds to the period from about 9500 bc to about 3700 bc. As will become apparent, by far the majority of rock art figures and panels were created within the Late Mesolithic and Early Neolithic. Despite the reluctance to use terms like Mesolithic and Neolithic in the northernmost part of Scandinavia, they will be the terms applied in this work. This choice also reflects one significant aim of the present work, which is to regard the rock art sites and areas on the entire peninsula as more or less integrated in a common history. Rock art, like prehistoric material culture, is usually arranged in local or regional chronologies. However, in order to fulfill the aim of this study, which is to regard the various rock art places as partly integrated in a common historical development, a neutral and non-local/ regional timetable is compulsory. This timetable must still capture the general northern European course of development. Hein Bjerck (1986; 2008a; 2008b: Tab. 3:3) has created a timetable following the Early-Middle-Late Mesolithic structure, however further divided into smaller and more \"handy\" units. The system is inspired by the natural sciences, and is comprised of 'chronozones'. For example, the Early Mesolithic is divided into EM1, EM2 and EM3, all sub phases of 500 calendric years each. Likewise, the Middle Mesolithic (MM) is divided in three, whereas the Late Mesolithic (LM) is divided into five units. Bjerck's time scale will work well as a common time reference for the rock art under examination."}
{"text": "The main reason is still its position at 25 m above sea level, which indicates it belongs to the Mesolithic. Its relative geographical closeness, \"more\" to the eastern Norwegian group than to Finland and western Russia, should also be taken into consideration. Other examples could be offered with regard to my grounds for suggesting absolute ages. Endeavors to create concrete connections between sites, in effect allowing for extrapolation of datings based on a commonality of very specific pictorial phenomena and elements, will be addressed in Chapter 10. The results coming out of this may be regarded as additions and a nuancing of the chronology presented in Figure 2.6. For the sake of accuracy, it should also be defined that the period represented in the 'common chronology' covers all of the EN, that is, until 3300 bc. This sub phase exceeds the strictly defined time frame of the present study, which more or less only has the ambition of covering the transition between the Mesolithic and the Neolithic, i.e until 3700 bc. Sites whose datings cover all of the EN are still listed in .1, if only to show that several of the sites and areas studied continued to be in use throughout the Early Neolithic. Lastly a word on my claim to study the \"total\" rock art material of the Mesolithic and earliest Early Neolithic. This totality certainly refers to what I defined to be the 'total available' sites. In recent years, an increasingly growing number of painted sites have been found. This increase especially applies to northern Sweden (e.g. Klang et al. 2002a; Viklund 2002; 2004), even if the number of painted sites is also growing in the southern part of the country. A few radiological datings from Hogberget in Vasternorrland, northern Sweden, indicates that the creating of painted sites have their point of gravity in the Neolithic, however with some indication of activity in the Late Mesolithic (Lindgren 2004). The painted site Fangsjon, and my pointing out of its relationship to Late Mesolithic imagery, may confirm this. Furthermore, it points to the possibility that the majority of this group in fact belongs to the period studied in this book. With the knowledge currently at hand, however, this group, with a few exceptions, is excluded from the present work."}
{"text": "## Introduction Based on the introductory remarks of this book, it should be no surprise that this chapter pursues a Levi-Straussian thread.The title of this chapter might as well have been \"A Levi-Straussian reappraisal\", for in the wake of post-structuralism, time has passed and given way to a new regard for this body of theory. I do not intend to present an _in toto_ assessment of the life and work of Levi-Strauss, but will instead try to address the possibilities that such an approach presents for the study of hunters' rock art in the context in question. Comprehensive accounts of Levi-Strauss have been published in great numbers already. Among these, the more recently presented material accentuates the potency of a theory, which I would claim is somehow forgotten among prehistorians, or alternatively, has vanished into the jungle of mainstream thinking in archaeology. An initial point to be made is thus that the universe of Levi-Strauss has more to offer. This version of'structuralism' is currently under penetrating scrutiny, also on an interdisciplinary level. From reading some of these accounts (Henaff 1998; Schmidt 2008; Wilcken 2010; Wiseman 2007; 2009a), it appears that Levi-Strauss's thought systems provide \"openings\" - new and productive heuristic devices - to areas within the humanities that earlier did not seem to gel with the field of structural anthropology. To my mind, this also holds true for prehistoric archaeology in general, and Stone Age rock art in particular. The focus in this book will be to explain my conviction, which is that Mesolithic hunters' rock art are displays of mythical thinking. The reader may argue that there is no great news in this statement, rather, rock art as an expression of mythic topics is widely addressed in recent literature on Nordic rock art. This is, of course, all true in some respects; in othersit is categorically false. For up until now these works have attempted to trace definite mythic narratives, or elements thereof, in the compositions. Put another way, recent studies tend to pursue the \"meaning\" of rock art. Unlike these quests for meaning, this study will be more focused upon how the symbols of rock art _operated_ in the society in which they were produced. It will thus have its point of departure in the employment of a methodology cultivating the position that hunters' rock art imagery is the product of the mythical mind, but will _not_ present the \"illustrated versions\" of myths prevailing in Mesolithic societies. Certainly, the mythical mind produces myths that are narrated and kept alive in society, and rock art is indeed also the result of such a mind. But this does not imply that rock art compositions should be studied as cartoon versions of finalized myths of the time. They do not, I would claim, include signs that are linked to definite meanings, but _are symbols in their production._ In this respect rock art, albeit a type of sign system, should be comprehended as more similar to music than to a spoken language. These introductory statements will be elaborated further down. This attempt will be mainly inspired by the not so well-known implications of the works of Levi-Strauss."}
{"text": "incest) in opposition to \"too-distant\". As such, and without knowing any context, we can achieve a rudimentary comprehension of the myth. It is a thematization of family relations, or in other words, it _concerns_ bonds of blood. The other two bundles that are set up against each other are the killing of monsters and the connotations of walking disabilities. In our modern context, this does not make any immediate sense. It does makes sense, however, if we are informed that royal families in ancient Greece were seen to be of chthonic origin, i.e. born directly out of the earth. The myths tell of kings being born of the soil and they share a common feature in the beginning of their life on earth: the inability to walk properly! Thus, what the myth takes up is the enigma of the opposition between the biological and cosmological. Here, the reference to a swollen foot representing a chthonic or cosmological origin stands in opposition to the defeating of monsters that by nature are also cosmological in origin. Oedipus, representing a walking disability and therefore godly origins, \"defeats\" this origin in himself by cracking the monster's riddle and killing the Sphinx. This example, although only roughly reproduced here, demonstrates that no specific interpretation, in terms of a privileged message, should be favored. But Levi-Strauss (see 1963: 13-16) provides us with the sense that, by knowing only some of the context, more substance is added to the binary structures and to the unsolvable \"problem\" that the myth addresses. We may go back to the previous quotation that myths may represent \"a sociology, a cosmology, a logic, an ethic, an art of living and a free play of thought\" and see how Levi-Strauss's analysis of the Oedipus myth, despite the lack of knowledge of the original context, still reveals the potential of containing several such codes. For instance it may concern the ethics of how family members should be at \"temperate\" positions towards each other (see also Wiseman 2001; 2009d) - not too far and not too close. Moreover and as already touched upon, it may concern sociology and cosmology, by its thematization of the tension between biological origin and ascribed origin: both sides represent truths that are oppositional and unsolvable. Thus, the myth is a mediating device of reflection over oppositional truths. According to Levi-Strauss, Freud indeed captured one out of a number of essential topic of the Oedipus myth, namely that of consanguine bonds. Through his structural analysis, Levi-Strauss created a foundation for claiming that it also represents the unresolvable and timeless enigma of being one person, but born out of two. The myth does not provide a final solution to any of the problems but is more a way of dealing with enigmatic facts through the play of thinking. As is obvious, there are at least two levels of meaning connected to the study of myths. The one level involves meanings related to specific codes. On this level the myth is told as a _chronological story_ liable to carry a hidden message, or secret. In the beginning of this chapter, I placed the word \"meaning\" within quotation marks when referring to this type to differentiate it from the type of meaning connected to the true analytical method, the one discerning meaning out of structure. Concerning the latter, it has become clear that the meaning-through-order-of-structure must be supported by meaning of the context. One may ask how meaning connected to these two levels can be separated; will they not intertwine? At this point it should be admitted that this is tricky; for as we have seen, the structural analysis of the Oedipus myth somehow ended up bearing the message that, so to speak, \"exceeds\"the structure. Wendy Doniger expresses this experience in the following way: \"The formula that Levi-Strauss often provides at the end often bleeds the myth of all its meanings. But before he gets to that end  reveals to us more complex levels of meaning\" (Doniger 2009: 200). Doniger, moreover, rightly claims that the cosmological level often is present in Levi-Straussian myth analysis. Nonetheless, it should not be forgotten that whatever code used, \"in the end\" by Levi-Strauss himself, does not replace the toil of structural analysis. Neither does it rule out his principal position that all codes belong to the myth. Yet, Henaff (1998: 170), similar to Doniger, implies that Levi-Strauss favours a sociological code. Wiseman seems to resolve this problem in his discussion of a body of Amerindian myths about the _Canoe Journey_**,** appearing in the fourth volume of _Mythologiques_ (Levi-Strauss 1981: 450-454). He maintains that the structure and structural analysis, or, as I understand him, rather the unconscious existence of a structure in myth, is exactly what makes all the codes relevant; structure makes a translation and _mediation between_ all the different codes _possible_. Mediation between the codes mutually strengthens the different versions of the story. In this way, sociological matters are empowered by cosmological matters and so on (Wiseman 2007: 174-175, 178; 2001; 2009d). With this in mind, it should be acknowledged that a marked split between \"meaning-provided-by-structure\" and \"meaning-provided-by-context\" cannot fully be used in our analysis. Whatever the outcome of discussing this aspect of Levi-Strauss's myth analysis, it will not really affect the purpose of the present study of rock art. My point will be to bring about one level of rock art analysis that is _not_ involved in quests for a narrative, diachronically narrated and carrying a specific message. In other words, I believe rock art motifs may be studied on the background of context, but not on codes. This implies that meaning related to code, and meanings related to context, both reside in the same space. As will be demonstrated further on, the two \"versions\" of meaning may be analytically separated by means of the true myth analysis. On the formal level, this involves discerning the structure of the mythical expression, the order of correlations and oppositions and their meaning, i.e. meaning provided by structure. Another important point to be made would be that the analytical level does not take into account the diachronic version of the myth, i.e. its chronology and existence as incidents taking place in time, in which the one episode naturally follows from a preceding one. Levi-Strauss's myth analysis is concerned with the synchronic perspective. The discerning of the mythemes, and bundles thereof, annuls time, and provides a synchronic perspective of the myth. The diachronic myth is the realization of the myth either in oral or written form. Thus the synchronic and the diachronic levels of the myth correlate to the division of, and the dialectic relation between, _langue_ and _parole_. Moreover, this synchronic level, revealing the structure and contents of the binary logic, represents _the unconscious_ levels of the human mind. An important point to be made involves a key aspect of Levi-Straussian thinking,which is that this level is possible to study, or access. For, these unconscious levels of the human mind are shared: the mind of the scientist is biologically the same as the mind represented in the anonymous _langue_ of the distant Other. The human mind is \"of the world\", as is nature. However, getting \"to\" the structure of a myth demands a methodical distance and analytical terseness. This is where Levi-Strauss is seen as a strong advocate of objectivism, scientism and ice-cold distance to the subjects. As discussed earlier in this work, the humanistic parallel line in his authorship is as strong as the scientific. Be that as it may, the points of relevance for the present study are that mythical logic, now defined to be a logic operating at the unconscious level and therefore accessible to us as scientists, does not produce finalized meanings, i.e. meanings connected to codes, finalized myths told through words or in illustrated versions of stories."}
{"text": "Henceforth, as archaeologists studying rock art, we should be more concerned _with what topics and oppositions are thematized_, and in some sense, be less involved in detecting a full narrative unfolded on the rock panel. Such stories, at least not in a cartooned version of a given myth, probably do not even exist in the panels. Similar to the Oedipus case, we only have fragmented access to the context. Thus we should not look for meaning in rock art, but rather focus on what it _concerns_. As will be clear, these concerns cannot come to the surface without initially addressing the empirical material, i.e. the depictions in rock combined with context. From what has been discussed so far, however, it can be concluded that the Oedipus myth concerns oppositional truths, truths about bonds of origin that were experienced to be mutually exclusive. From this, we may ask, what oppositional truths do northern hunters' rock art _concern_? Alternatively, what topics are taken up in the motifs? This is where I approach a preliminary definition of the _moteme_. Before embarking on an initial elaboration of this concept, we need to revisit the issue of interpretation and meaning. Going back several decennia in our disciplinary history, important steps were made concerning hunters' rock art and meaning."}
{"text": "Another important point, not specifically addressed so far, is how mythemes and myths _transform_ (cf. the river metaphor in an earlier section); this forms an essential feature in Levi-Strauss's myth analysis. However, it should be pointed out that mythical production partly originates in the unconscious layers of the human mind (cf. Levi-Strauss 1987). In the present study, it is exactly this layer of meaning that will be addressed. It will be focused on because I believe it exists as objective fact, and therefore possible to unveil. This is the potential _anonymous_ meaning in local products of the human mind. As such it resides in \"objects\", that is rock art, of a given Stone Age life world. This conclusion demands a last comment linked to the fact that post-structuralist rock art analysis in fact addressed this anonymous level in its methodological and formal stage of analysis. So, why object to the idea of figural compositions being imbued with a specific grammar, a cultural grammar detached from the strict text metaphor? Could we not follow the formal stage of a grammar analysis, just for the sake of the results they produce? The discerning of a grammar in rock art is indeed productive, and somehow I do believe this approach has brought to light interesting features of the empirical material, albeit only within restricted geographical areas. Hesjedal, Tilley and Leroi-Gourhan convincingly managed to reveal a specific regularity in the compositions of the panels - that is the frequency of a motif type, which motifs occur together and which do not.  Why then, could not the grammar approach be relevant as a way of discerning such features in the present study? While being open to such a pragmatic methodological attitude, my objection to this is paradoxically enough, rather practical. For the answer as to why a grammar analysis would not be adequate is partly based on my conviction that such a grammar cannot possibly be unveiled when addressing the large scale. Another way of putting this is to say that the body of Mesolithic hunters' rock art on the Scandinavian peninsula is all too complex.  So, what is my alternative? Will not the application of the wild-mind perspective involve some version of binary oppositions, regularities or repetitions?"}
{"text": "### A preliminary definition of the _moteme_ When observing depicted species in Late Mesolithic rock art, the overall impression, or rather fact, would be its strong focus on terrestrial big game, or in other words, it contains a minimum of species belonging to the sea.In his popular book on the Alta material, Helskog reports altogether ten fish figures, of which eight are halibut and five whales. Birds are similarly seldom depicted (Helskog 2012b: 88).  If the percentage of figures of non-terrestrial species to terrestrial species were calculated, it would be virtually zero.  To correctly state that the most frequently depicted category in hunters' rock art on the Scandinavian peninsula is big terrestrial mammals sounds almost like an understatement. Thus, to reiterate, Mesolithic people must somehow, and regardless of the contents of their everyday diet, have had an extraordinary focus on big game. A thread running throughout my earlier works (e.g. Fuglestvedt 2009; 2012) will be pursued further, as it could be said to be the point of departure for this discussion. This concerns what could be called a Mesolithic human ontology and involves the genuinely Mesolithic issues, raised by Mesolithic people, concerning the nature of humanity. One thesis of this work will be that human reflection about their own nature did not take place without reference to the kingdoms of big game. The human and big game relationship form the great and durable enigma throughout the Mesolithic. Based on this, I hereby define the _moteme to be the smallest motif unit of significance_ in Nordic hunters' rock art.  The moteme represent a _hematization of this great enigma_ of humans and big game. Here,'meaning' refers to the mere thematization of this enigma, or binary opposition. If I am to define a grammar, or rather a _partial grammar_ at work, it would be this significant and enigmatic relationship between human and game. One could thus say that this opposition creates _langue_, while its realization in motemes represents _parole_. This relationship will be explored in the next chapter, as will the full contents of the moteme concept. Here, the more formal aspects will be explained. As touched upon in an earlier section, Levi-Strauss (1963: 206-231) compared the smallest analytical units of myth analysis, the mythemes, with the phonemes of structural linguistics. In a similar manner I will set up the moteme on a par with the mytheme. However, as Levi-Strauss apparently made this comparison with great reluctance, so too will this reluctance be carried over to my mytheme-moteme parallel. The common feature with the phoneme and mytheme is that they make up the basic elements of their respective communicative systems. This parallel implies that the mytheme, similar to the phoneme, is bereft of meaning; its opposing status to other phonemes/mythemes provides the meaning. In other words, meaning is provided by structure. There is, however, a certain ambiguity in Levi-Strauss on this point. One way of explaining this would be with reference to what was addressed in the foregoing section concerning the internal difference between different communicative systems. For instance, the elements building up language proper, myths and pieces of plastic art cannot always be compared. More concretely, the mytheme cannot be totally void of meaning as long as it makes up part of the plot, and thereby contains sentences that necessarily _must_ carry some level of meaning. Levi-Strauss's position is rather that the meaning when unveiled within its structure and context, is increased. The mytheme carries meaning, however \"less meaning\" when regarded in isolation (e.g. Pateman 1984). So, the mytheme is not void of meaning, and neither is the moteme. Thus, the mytheme and moteme are on a par. However, the oppositions and correlations are built up of mythemes, or bundles thereof. At this point the mytheme and moteme disconnect as the nature of the moteme is that _it imbues this opposition already_. As defined earlier, the moteme is a motif element that concerns a vital Mesolithic human enigma. Thus, the moteme contains the essential structural opposition and could be said to have parallels in the full myth, and not only the mytheme. Therefore, a question to be posed is why the moteme could not be seen as, in fact, having its parallel in the myth, and not the mytheme? To my mind, such an argument cannot be totally denied, but neither can it be affirmed. The reason is simple: again we are confronting the idea that mythical thinking expressed in myths and the one expressed in rock art do represent different communicative systems. Consequently, any parallels should only be used on a rudimentary level and with caution. Nonetheless, my openness to a kind of parallelism between mytheme and moteme reflects that I see the possibility that motemes do, in fact, represent elements of a larger structure36 that includes the entire panel or section of a rock art site. This structure would not be \"the whole story\" but literally, _the full picture_. In the following I will use this term 'full picture' to denote a panel that, in its totality, and including all, or most motifs, is seen to be part of one integrated composition. Footnote 36: The _mytheme_ is a _mytheme_. So far, the works influenced by structuralist thinking involve such a full-picture-understanding of the panel. To Leroi-Gourhan, compositions in the caves of Palaeolithic art started with depictions of numerous principal animals in the center of the panel, from which other figures were added in a multi-directional manner, along an imaginary \"curve of a bell\", yet also structured by the topography of the panel (Leroi-Gourhan 1982: 72-73). Hesjedal's and Tilley's works on hunters' rock art also take the entire panels into account,in that the panel is seen to create a balance of symmetry in terms of number of species and their topographical position. How could the concept of moteme be understood in relation to the idea of a 'full picture'? To answer this, let us look at more recent approaches to this. In this book, the motemes that concern the human-big game relationship is the one that will be cultivated.  In principle, however, there is no reason why one could not investigate another class of motemes, for instance the enigma between bears and humans. Neither is there any reason why one cannot regard the full picture as built up of motemes. Helskog's (2012a) article on the bear motif in the Kafjord upper panel in Alta could serve as example. Here, bears and bear-associated depictions are involved in a large section of the panel; long lines of bear footprints connect figures of walking bears. As referred earlier in this chapter, Helskog suggests that this is a display of the bear wandering throughout the cycle of the year. Some circle motifs in this section are suggested to represent the sun and the moon, and a connection to these figures is made to support his argument that the panel could be understood as a display of the cycle of time and of Stone Age conceptions about the role of the bear in the maintaining of the coming and going of the seasons. The suggested connectedness of bear, den and footprints works convincingly as a way of understanding the integration of larger parts of the panel. Therefore, I believe the connectedness between bears, footprints and dens cannot be denied. Helskog's _interpretation_, however, is built upon this basic structure that derives from a fuller story, and thus also the fuller picture. The consequence is that other motifs, not immediately relating to the bear, are included and given a referential status that matches the narrative. The interpretation could thus be seen as a narrative of a cosmological code. Within this code, the abstract circles are suggested to represent sun and moon; the circle of dancing people is interpreted as being related to the sun, moon and bear wandering and showing a ritual taking place at a certain season, which taken together, are an integral part of the story of the bear."}
{"text": "Similar to the myths, they do not reflect anything \"finished\" and agreed upon; both media are more to be understood as intellectual reflections, or exercises _in the making_. These are processes taking place in an environment allowing wild thinking. Rock art thus represents a visual version of mytho-logics. The hunters' rock art on the Scandinavian peninsula is the product of human knowledge in the moment of its making. Rock art is the figural outcome of subjects' literally playing out their intellectual capacities, their thinking through significant representations in their milieu, about the oppositions in nature and in the social world, how they possibly could be united, how they could be inverted and how they never can unite. 'Meaning', in terms of Levi-Strauss's _codes_, i.e. of a hidden message diachronically arranged, seems after all to have less significance in this context. For mythic material provides no solution but serves more like a device for reflection and meditation as well as for _mediation_. So, to summarize the comparisons to myth terminology, similar to myths, motemes mirror each other. Similar to mythemes, motemes may transform from metaphoric to metonymic status. Similar to myths, motemes are devices for reflection, but unlike the mytheme, the moteme bears the original opposition, or enigma. And finally, similar to the myth _and_ the mytheme, the moteme is highly transformable. A rock art panel is thus seen to be the unfolding of motemes at the moments of its realization. Therefore, Mesolithic hunters' rock art is seen to be a product of the wild mind _in action_. For, the wild mind is dynamic. Critique against Levi-Strauss, or structuralism, sometimes subtly refers to the method as revealing a _closed system_ of signification. This is apparently a bad word, bearing a message that prehistoric people were limited. Well, in a way they were, and what else could they be? The use and reuse of the same signifiers was the condition available to people in the prehistoric world. Still, it is high time that the _transformative logic_ of analogical thinking is highlighted as a way of understanding the wild mind, and in particular, the Mesolithic world of communication. I would argue that this aspect of Levi-Strauss's thinking has been under-communicated. Transformative logic, when experienced empirically, certainly gives no reason to think that'structuralism' creates people that are limited; rather, the dynamics of the wild mind will come to the surface. In the next chapter we will follow the transformation of the key moteme throughout the Scandinavian peninsula. Against the background of what is concluded thus far, a new foundation has been created to answer a central issue of this chapter: Why cannot rock art be regarded as the cartoon version of spoken myths?  And what is rock art's relationship to myths? Like myths, figural art _derives_ from mythical thinking, and originates in the same context of totalizing issues. Moreover, they are also meditations, as well as mediations, over unsolvable paradoxes of this thought universe. However, I think it is important to emphasize the idea that hunters' rock art of the north are not myths but derivations of mythical thinking. Hereby I provide a broader myth concept. There might be a need for this, simply because I think that it is right to say that not only does rock art, in this context, have a relationship to the myth area, but it also explains why the panels never, or seldom, seem to present the \"whole story\". This is because they are not the \"whole story\"; they represent a different medium of the mythical mind, namely a figural and visual one. They consist of elements, but they are _not_ unfolding diachronically. _How could they_, given that their _unfolding is in space_ and not in time? The stage of their origin is a rock panel, and the rhythm of its making is different from the one existing in an oral situation around the campfire."}
{"text": "### Metaphoric and metonymic animals Let me start this section by telling an anecdote.In my childhood there was a dog, apparently with no owner, that roamed around in our local community. This dog, a mix of different shepherd breeds, was nice and gentle, but quite odd. This oddity was enhanced by its vague origin as belonging to an unidentified owner. The dog was called George, a name that everybody immediately reacted to with laughter and comments. George was certainly not a proper name for a dog! In retrospect one may speculate on the origin of this anonymous agreement on a dog's name. Why did everybody think the same? And, would the reaction be the same if George was the name of a parrot? I think not, and this vivid encounter with a \"wrong\" name of a dog draws attention to some essential features in our perception of animals. Dogs are part of the human community, as they have been since the early Stone Age in Scandinavia. Their status as \"persons\" and family members is underscored, for example, by the mix of human and dog burials in Late Mesolithic Scania (e.g. Larsson 1989; 1990; 1993). Dogs have names that demarcate them from human names because they are small family members, \"next-to-humans\" or wannabe-humans. Following the line of reasoning in _The Savage Mind_ (Levi-Strauss 1966) dogs' relationship to human society is by this _metonymic_ - they stand for something more than what they are themselves; they are small representatives of a larger unity (cf. Willerslev 2007: 75-76). As mini-versions of human persons - and as closely attached to the human world, but simultaneously different - it is experienced as wrong if they are given proper human names. As small humans, but still dogs, they are to be given names that demarcate them from humanity. Perhaps the dog George was given this name precisely because his family origin was blurry; his relationship as part of humanity was ambiguous. On the other hand, rorts called Jacob and George do not seem to provoke similar reactions - in fact, such names are preferred. So, strong opinions on the correct naming of animals reveal some general and unconscious structures. Certainly there is cultural variation. However, with reference to what we know about the dog-human relationship since the Stone Age, \"dogs as metonymic humans\" may seem to be valid in our context of study. The naming of our animal friends concerns the nature of our relationship with the species, that is, whether the relationship is metaphoric or metonymic in character. Generally speaking, it is metaphoric when the animal species - their group or their \"society\" - is conceived as being external to the human world, but simultaneously forming a _parallel_ to it, yet through this parallelism, also bearing a kind of similarity. This is the case with birds. Their life is definitively external to human society as they live in a community of their own, and are communicating in a language analogous to that of humans. Humans unconsciously conceive of birds as being in a metaphoric relationship. Conversely, the relationship will be metonymic when animals are part of human society, and as such \"stand for\" the human world, as is the case with dogs. Unlike other domestic animals, dogs are not eaten. This places domestic animals, like cattle and sheep, in yet another relationship with humans. These animals are, therefore, in a non-human relationship; they live in human custody, but are not personalities in the sense of mini-humans. While dogs are metonymic humans, cattle and sheep are metonymic non-humans. This Levi-Straussian system of thinking about human relationships to different animal species, and classes of names is a field of its own. Much more could be said (see Levi-Strauss 1966: 203-208 for elaboration of the system in more detail). Here, the point is merely to create a background for investigating the human conceptions of animals during the Mesolithic. We do not know of any other domesticated or semi-domesticated animals, even if taming of wild reindeer, to some extent, would not be unthinkable. The domestication of animals in the Neolithic, and the industrial period combined, covers a raft of different human-animal associations, ready to invite reflections over combinations of metonymic and metaphoric human and non-human relationships. Immediately it would seem that the Mesolithic offers a less complicated situation. Dogs have already been defined as met-onymic Mesolithic people. Apart from dogs, all wild species would seem to be living in a parallel world of their own. Thus, at the outset all other species than dogs may, in principle, have had a metaphoric relationship from the view of human (unconscious) perception. Be this as it may, the point here is not to go into further classifications of affiliation to the totality of animal species, but rather to define the one that appears to be of most significance. Judging from what is most frequently depicted in hunters' rock art, this would be big game, that is, the larger species of Cervidae: elk (_Alces alces_), reindeer (_Rangifer tarandus_) and red deer (_Cervus elaphus_). In the Alta Phase 1 rock art, Helskog (2012b: 88) reports that the number of depicted fish and sea mammals amounts to only 15 figures altogether. As pointed out in the preceding chapter, a calculation of the percentage of sea species within the total material of rock art figures of the earliest phase in Alta would come down to nothing. This supports the trivial and well-known fact that hunting societies worldwide attribute special significance to big mammals, in particular the terrestrial ones. The role of the eland in South African spirituality, the bison in North America and elk and reindeer in the Northern Hemisphere are but a few examples of this phenomenon. Thus, the significant position of big game in the Mesolithic Nordic context is supported by the empirical facts of rock art. My preliminary definition of the moteme implies that it imbues the structure of an enigmatic human-animal relationship. For the context in question, this could principally also include human-bear, human-whale or other presumably metaphoric relationships. In this work, however, the Cervidae species is the category that will be focused upon. For reasons implied already, this is partly due to their frequency as depicted animals. Nevertheless, the mere testimony of such frequency is sufficient reason as to why the metaphoric relationship to big game is seen to make up a _key homology_ in Mesolithic people's reflection upon the nature of their being and their role in this world. Central in this reflection was the reference to the society of big game. Thus, the basic thesis in this work is expressed in the following statement: _human reflection on their being could not take place without reference to the world of big game_. Put differently, Late Mesolithic ontology is intimately tied to thinking about large terrestrial mammals. This focus has, by its nature, one particular weakness, that is how other significant animals, albeit much less frequently depicted, fly \"under the radar\" of the investigation. This concerns the other large mammals, particularly the bear and whale, as well as seals and fish species like salmon and halibut. Halibut sometimes grow very large, and could in some cases be regarded as large game. In all probability, these other species are indeed a part of the Mesolithic webs of analogical reasoning as they ultimately may connect to the human-big game analogy. One way of regarding this would be to claim that the non-big-game species are indirectly present in this study, however not always captured through the method in operation. Alternatively, they belong to analogical webs of their own. Yet in the world of bricoleur thinking - where everything is connected in a totality - such webs would somehow still be connected. In the Bergbukten 1 panel in Hjemmeluft, Alta, a \"confrontation\" between a mixed elk-bear figure and a halibut is depicted. This is but one example of a probable connection, in the sense of being present in the same analogical web, between elk, bear and this fish species."}
{"text": " Still, due to lower figure frequencies of these other significant animals, the possibilities of following eventual connections through visual transformation are poor. In contrast, the focus on big game and big game-related topics is overwhelming. As a result of their frequency in numbers, it will also be possible to follow their motemic repetitions and transformations. So, judging from the frequency of depictions, big game seems to have been \"on the top\" of the Mesolithic mind. Hence, the empirical material, in fact, demands a place at the forefront of the author's mind as well."}
{"text": "### Defining motemes through the agency of hunting The bulk of motifs in our empirical material thematizes concrete life situations.As addressed in the preceding section, the notion of sacred landscapes and the hunting of big game involves a life that is an inseparable imprecation of spirituality and technology in the broadest sense. A schematic representation of this is suggested by way of the hunting cycle (Figure 4.8). This thought figure is meant to visualize what could be called an 'agency of hunting' connected to a cyclic co-life with big game. The agency and beliefs Figure 4.8: The hunting cycle (illustration IF, tracing HV). connected to hunting are manifest in hunters' rock art. Some of the stages of the hunting cycle can be found thematized in motifs in northern hunters' rock art. These form the basis for explaining, as well as categorizing the motemes of Mesolithic and the earliest Early Neolithic rock art on the Scandinavian peninsula. In a certain sense, all actions taking place within the hunting cycle concern _communication_ with the animal master or animal society. This communication is seen to be of essential value in the sustainment of a good human-animal relationship. A beneficial cooperation makes the world go round and secures the life-sustaining forces of hunting societies. The bulk of this communication occurs through _mediation_. Rock art making in itself may generally be seen as an act of mediation between the two parallel worlds, but so are several of the communicative acts involved in the hunting cycle. Mediation is about minimalizing the distance and difference between the two worlds. Such a minimalizing practice can be regarded at the level of tool and artifact making. Thus, the manufacture and not least the _use_ of all kinds of gear and equipment made from parts of the animal body - or imitations or replicas made of other material than animal body elements - are acts of mediation. This includes the use of bone and antler tools from the animal, the wearing of clothes made of hide and tooth pendants and headdresses (antlers). It may even involve the dwelling in house structures made of raw materials from the animals. Part of rock art imagery is, however, the _elk-boats_, boats that were probably made of elk hides and adorned with an elk head on its stem. The elk-boat _as a concept_, and probably as a real object in the Late Mesolithic world (Era-Esko 1958), probably originates in the image of a swimming elk. The elk is an excellent swimmer, known to be able to swim up to 50 km.  Seen at a distance, swimming, it might be hard to tell whether it is a boat or an elk. There are several clues documented in rock art that indicate Stone Age people considered this association significant. The sacred geography represented in several panels of the Alta rock art shows a pattern in which a considerable number of elk figures are depicted in the lower part of the panel, linking this animal to the lower cosmic zone, or close to it (Helskog 2012b: 83; Gjerde 2010a: 280). This supports the idea that Mesolithic people - as is the case in historical circumpolar traditions - regarded elks to belong to the underworld. An elk-boat, however, does not only mediate between the two worlds. Following Lahelma's  examination of this motif and taking into account that its medium is water, the boat could be seen to be _on its way_ to this other world, or for that matter returning from it. By its \"breaking\" of the water crust, the boat is placed right at the entrance to the other world. In fact, living a co-life with animals involves mediation on a daily basis. Mediation, however, is primarily associated with rock art depictions of non-fixed, or 'hybrid' identities. In turn, these images immediately bring to mind situations of \"pure\" ritual. In particular this concerns hunting scenes and related motifs. Our study material depicts the use of regular hunting tools (bow and arrow, spear) as well as of artifacts related to hybrid identity in hunting scenes. A hunting scene is defined as a confrontation between a human being carrying a weapon and an animal. Not disregarding the fact that native hunters conceive the act of hunting as a ritual, other types of confrontations are displayed in rock art (cf. Lodoen, 2009). These confrontations relate to the hunting scene, but may involve an array of combinations of identities of the involved parties, like for instance confrontation between elk head poles and deer, or two human beings approaching each other and holding elk head poles. The latter scenes thus relate even more to \"pure\" ritual situations. The border between hunting scenes and scenes associated with such confrontations is blurry, and so are the depicted weapons involved. A type of mediating instrument is the one represented in compositions of carriers of _elk head poles_. This figure category exists in all rock art areas of Mesolithic Scandinavia except for eastern Norway. Elk head poles are found as concrete artifacts in Baltic Late Mesolithic grave finds, and measure up to 50 cm in length (e.g. Zagorskis, 2004; Fig. V; Kashina & Zhulnikov, 2011). In rock art it is depicted in scenes showing a variety of types of motifs showing confrontation, like elk pole holders approaching each other, or converging elk head holder and elk-boat - the latter sometimes even staffed with humans holding elk poles - or, a hunter confronting a herd of big game and so forth. In a motif from Bergbukten 4B, Alta (Figure 4.9) it may seem as though it Figure 4.9: Section from Bergbukten 4B, Hjemmeluft, Alta, Finnmark, showing a scene of confrontation involving a human holding up an elk head pole in front of an elk (photo IF). was also part of hunting technology, as it may have been used to club the elk on its forehead. Before continuing, some comments on elk head poles and their associated artifacts could be relevant. At the outset, I would like to state that this mediating instrument depicted in rock art, in addition to being a device of mediation, also could be seen to represent a hybrid status. In a similar way as the 'elk-humans', these artifacts could represent a fluid position between big game and human. Similar to the human use of an elk's headdress, we may consider it as an instrument of seduction, to make the elk offer itself to the hunter. However, given that the finds of this artifact category are quite non-realistic representations of elk heads, they are most likely part of ritual confrontations. Yet again, this assumption can be challenged. The Mesolithic find category of decorated star-shaped hatchets of soapstone is likely to have had a similar or parallel function to the big game head poles of organic material. As such it also forms a parallel to similar weapons made of real antler, as represented in a find of deer antlers and one antler weapon from the bog near Viul, Buskerud, in eastern Norway (Figure 4.10). This artifact has an unfinished hole, implying that it was meant to be mounted on a pole or stick. It is probably akin to the elk head poles, and probably represents a side category to the aforementioned hatchets of soapstone known from the Middle and Late Mesolithic in Norway and Sweden. Interestingly, Glorstad (2010: 185-197) has suggested that these pick axes could be considered representations, in stone, of parts of the elk's antler (Figure 4.11). Similar to the idiom of elk pole holders, this artifact category is an interregional artifact, and no doubt a status weapon. Thus, apparently there existed a number of artifact types bearing similar connotations, and of which some might have served a purely ritual role beside the ones that were useful in a combination of situations.  The rather lightweight elk head poles found in Mesolithic graves probably represent the more ritual situations. Whichever is the case, as mere depictions in rock art they never represent actual reality, and their making, i.e. as rock art figures, is most probably a ritual situation in itself. The point here is still that they represent _meditations_ between the human world and the parallel one of the big game animals."}
{"text": "### Defining motemes through visual transformations Mesolithic ontology centers around the relationship with, and reflection on, \"us\" and \"them\", or, what are the humans as a group - in contrast and similarity to - the animals as a group.The human mind thus perceived human society as some version of the animal society and vice versa. In the Mesolithic context this applies to the \"society\" of big game. This homological relationship, in fact a _key homology_, makes the animal person a metaphorical human and animal society a metaphor of the human society. At the outset, the metaphoric relationship with big game involves a human condition marked by animic conceptions and perceptions. This involves a kind of unity with the animals, concretized by the 'hunting cycle', involving a kind of living in which the humans are induced into the animal society and its rhythm. The key moteme depicts herds, or smaller groups pulling in the same direction. They make a group, simply spoken; they are together - integrated. Earlier I pointed out the somewhat paradoxical trait of the _Late_ Mesolithic mind, which is the \"obsession\" with herds, a phenomenon that while somewhat contradictory would be a thought structure more associated with the Late Palaeolithic and Early Mesolithic reality. A major thesis of this work has grown from this peculiarity, a claim which forms a starting point for the study of motemic variations: _that the focus on herds, an obsession with the sociality of animals, is related to a new and emerging focus on human society_. Ultimately this focuses attention on a related matter - later to be recorded archaeologically - of human society as a matrix of _categories_. This is totemism. By this, we confront one among several examples of the mutual relationship and \"dependency\" between two main categories of hunter-gatherer perception, that of animism versus totemism. It would seem that a typical animic trait is the outset for developing totemic conceptions. This issue will be given greater attention in Chapter 7 of this book. The key moteme of all Late Mesolithic rock art on the Scandinavian peninsula is the herd of big game. I am tempted to claim that from this, all begins. This marks a genuine reflection on the society of big game - in relation to the society of humans; a meditation over the difference and similarities of society of animals versus society of humans. From this key homology emerge the visual analogical transformations that will be addressed in this section. The visual richness of many panels is immense; what is extracted from it in this work, follows the path of analysis derived from the modeling of a visual logic through which transformations and inversions are created."}
{"text": "### Examples of visual transformation of the key moteme The study of visual transformations of the herd of big game is based on the key homology.This implies the assumption that there must be a congruence, or approximation between the depiction of the human society and that of the animals. Not least, such _correspondences_ must necessarily be expressed on the visual level. In the preceding chapter, rock art in our context was defined as the actions of the wild mind, or more precisely, aesthetically expressed reflections over the Mesolithic leitmotif, also defined as the human - big game enigma. These reflections take place along routes of an analogical logic on the _visual_ or figurative plane. To reiterate, the analogical difference is a difference based on similarities between the differing \"parties\". As we shall see, the transformation of figures - and the paths of analogical transformations - is possible partly due to the ambiguity of figural representations. #### Vingen: example of visual transformation of the herd moteme The elk head pole holder, or in the Vingen context, the holders of deer heads, has one characteristic feature in this rock art area: the holders are not present. What is depicted is solely the head pole. Thus in Vingen this motif could be understood as having a metonymic function: the depiction of the pole \"stands for\" a depiction of a human holding it. As is the case for the herd of big game moteme, the deer pole comes in several stylistic versions. As touched upon earlier, such a quaint way of reproducing this moteme in the Vingen version make us question - even more so than is the case in other areas - whether it represents a human or a deer; yet, this question is perhaps precisely the rationale behind the depiction. This ambiguity comes to the surface several places in Vingen, of which one is already mentioned (cf. Figures 4.12-4.13). The panel _Naedste Laegda_ (Figure 4.18) consists of a few single deer and several deer head poles; in fact the panel displays a variation of the herd of big game moteme, as it contains _bends of bead poles_. The head pole in itself represents a strong ambiguity - is it a human, a deer, or both? As such, however, it would be a tremendously effective device for expressing the analogy between the two \"societies\" - the one of big game, and that of humans. It is also to be seen as a mediating device. The panel could be regarded as a statement of the analogy between head pole holders, or herd of people - with the herd of deer. This analogy is even underpinned by way of style; for, at closer look, it becomes obvious that there is a figural similarity between the torsos of the deer and the heads of the poles. Turning the reproduction of the panel upside down to the end of the bed, the head pole is a good example of the head pole. Figure 4.18: Section from panel Nedste Laegda, Vingen, Sogn og Fjordane (after Lodoen & Mandt 2012; Fig. 9.13.1). and adding sticks to the elk torsos (Figure 4.19), the depicted appearance of the deer become identical with the head poles. Thus, the deer poles, or the absent humans who carry them, _are_ like deer; alternatively, the deer (poles) are both poles and humans. With this example we are provided with a concrete manifestation of the key homology at work in the Late Mesolithic mind. As argued for in the foregoing, this congruence between the \"two societies\" is a pan-Nordic phenomenon. We will go further in investigating this visual homology, taking a vantage point in the Alta rock art. #### From key homology to circles and graphic designs: starting at Kafjord Upper A key to the understanding of transformations of the herd-of-big-game moteme is found in a section from Kafjord Upper, Alta (Figure 4.20). In this panel, the key homology is expressed in a strikingly obvious and concrete Figure 4.19: Nedste Laegda section rotated 180\\({}^{\\circ}\\) and with poles added to the torsos of the deer. way, which helps us understand yet other - and not immediately similarly obvious - transformations in the other figurative material. Let us focus on the part of the section including the great corral (Figure 4.21). This corral represent an encirclement and as such it encircles a herd of big game. If our focus shifts towards the left and slightly upwards, we see a group of humans, of which most are standing in a circle. The Kafjord panel also seems to offer testimony of a relationship between the two motifs, as they seem to be tied together by a row of human figures depicted extending from the corral to the area of the human circle. The composition might also offer other pictorial ties between the two areas, like the line of footprints from within the corral, leading to a smaller corral of one single animal depicted close to the area of the human figures. The circle of humans, I suggest, should be taken at face value, namely as a depiction of human society. In this way, the section displays its own _visual version of the original homology_ between the society of the humans and the society of big game. These unique figural elements in the Kafjord panel could be a point of departure to reflect on the dynamics of figure making. In fact, I believe this panel offers us essential keys to the understanding of some core connections and transformations in Mesolithic rock art imagery as such. Thus, it is an obvious place to start, given its concrete intelligibility. A homology requisite is that the relationship exists through a metaphorical analogy - the community of humans is seen to be a \"kind of\" community of big game and vice versa. So, let us focus on my proposition that the society of humans is expressed by depicted human bodies arranged as a row of people in a circle. The encirclement drawn around the herd of big game adds a visual element to the homology \"society of humans and society of Figure 4.20: The rock art site of Kfjord, Alta, Finnmark (photo IF). big game\", thus manifesting this metaphoric relationship on a visual level as well; the _circle_ of people and the _encirclement_ of a herd of big game. The circle could be seen to stand for \"society\", either human or animal. Tentatively, I will suggest here that the circle motif primarily represents human society. One reason to favour this \"side\" of the homology is the reference to the encirclement as a human-made construction, and one made through human cooperation. The circle may thus communicate that the world of the humans is a world of integrity, in other words of bonds and of cooperation. By using this example I want to point out how rock art making in this context seems to create its own logic, a kind of _visual reflection_; the initial abstract homology between society of game and society of humans has, in this way, gained figural expression: this is the homology between circle and encirclement. As we shall see, this visual homology can be \"played with\" through an infinite number of variations. Thus, in another section of the Kafjord panel this motif is repeated, or if you like, _varied_; here a group of humans is arranged in a circle, creating an encirclement, around a small herd of big game. In this version of the circle-encirclement homology, the encirclement is not _made by_ humans, but _made up of_ humans. So far, the initially described circle of people, and this circle of human figures, as well as the corral, are all to be seen as expressive variants with some common origin, or ideas revolving around interconnected phenomena (Figure 4.22). The depictions in Figure 4.22a form a circle of people, and as such, it is related to the circle of people in Figure 4.22b. It is also to be seen as a circle encircling a small herd of big game, and in this way, it relates to the corral in Figure 4.22c. Through the visual homology of the circle the three motifs are related. At a preliminary stage, it may seem that Figure 4.22a would form the \"intermediary\" connection between the two others. Consider, however, the following: in Figure 4.22c the animals are encircled by a fence _made by_ people, while the encirclement in Figure 4.22a is _made up of_ people."}
{"text": "### Conclusion on graphic designs in Alta By way of examples from Alta, a number of visual abbreviations were demonstrated, in turn leading to transformations to specific graphic designs.This represents only one type of visual analogical and transformative logic. As we saw, the developments of designs out of contraction and simplification demand a row or chain of human figures. In this way, the transformative process into four principal types of design could be followed: the diamond, the zigzag, the vertical lines and the half hexagons. It could be noted, however, that the zigzag and diamond are closely related, as both could be traced back to chains of human heads adorned with elk antlers. The diamond relates to a contracted version of the repetitions of this row, whereas the zigzag is related to a simplification of the non-contracted version. Moreover, it was stated that the zigzag could be regarded as a \"cutoff\" version of two rows of diamonds on top of each other or, as expressed earlier as 'half diamonds'. In line with this, a full hexagon design could be seen as easily evolving from the 'half hexagon' that was traced back from the chain of dancing human figures. Additionally, the simple cross could be seen as a second variety of the half diamond. In sum, the four principal designs, when regarded with their probable area of variation, expand to six to eight types of graphic designs (cf. Figure 4.46). The Alta rock art contains more types of graphic designs. The final designs decided upon here are the ones that are recognized to have a creation story to be explained in the manner of Leroi-Gourhan, or alternatively as \"contraction and simplification of repeated and accumulated figures\". In the case of Vingen, we shall recognize the aptness of the term \"accumulation\"."}
{"text": "### A Late Mesolithic'motemic geography' In the Scandinavian Late Mesolithic regions, areas or even sites of rock art display a style of its own.The concept of the moteme does not take these kinds of differences into account, but produces its results from what I have recognized to be a general Mesolithic leitmotif. The invention and enquiry into every panel's contents of motemes (.1 and see full list of motemes in catalogue at www.hf.uio.no/iakh/personer/vit/ingrifu/motemes-in-mesolithic-rock-art.pdf) provides a device for description of _a motemic geography_ (Figure 4.52), that is, the features of geographic distribution of motemes in Late Mesolithic rock art on the Scandinavian peninsula. The regional features appearing call for some comments of which the most obvious, if not surprising, fact is how the Alta Phase 1 rock art includes the entire motemic variability. This fact may be considered as some kind of tautology, since the very idea of motemic variation originates in the Alta Phase 1 rock art. Certainly, the invention of motemes and the concept of motemic variation would not be possible without knowledge of this material. No doubt this rock art area represents something very special. The question addressing why Alta Phase 1 contains \"it all\" is intriguing and encourages consideration of this area's role as a meeting place and crossing point generating a genuine ritual creativity. Moreover, it challenges an unconscious assumption among us, namely the idea that inventions must originate in the south from where it spreads to the north. Whatever the case might be, the Alta rock art Phase 1 can be considered as the point from which descriptions of the other two great rock art areas will follow. Thus comparing Namforsen to Alta Phase 1, \"presences and absences\" in comparison to the latter appear; the primary group of motemes that were defined is richly represented in Namforsen. These are the ones thematizing the hunting cycle, and more specifically big game, their parallel world, their return and human mediation of, and confrontation with, this other world and its beings. There is however one exception: hunting scenes are totally lacking in Namforsen. There is one elk figure with an arrow depicted on its torso, but this composition most probably does not belong to the Late Mesolithic. Thus, the Alta rock art is the only area containing hunting scenes. Still Namforsen and Alta are similar with respect to the first group of motemes (cf. motemic classes 1-4). The strong presence of elk-boats, and imagery connected to elk ambiguity in general, underscores the similarity between the two rock art areas. Moreover,Figure 4.52: A motemic geography including the eastern Norwegian group of rock art and the three large rock art areas Alta, Vingen (with Ausevik) and Namforsen (illustration by the author, tracing AJN). Figure 4.52: (Continued) the two great rock art areas both contain the complex types of confrontation motemes. However, a most striking \"absence\" in Namforsen in relation to Alta phase 1 is the almost total _lack of motemeshematizing human society_. The possible exception to this overwhelming impression should still be mentioned; in panel D10-11 (Larsson & Brostrom 2011: 20), a row or chain of three or four human beings \"liable\" to transform to a pattern is depicted. Close to this composition is a circle-like motif that possibly could be taken to represent a small corral. Otherwise, there are one or perhaps two elks with body fill in Namforsen, but again, this composition is not part of the period examined here (see comment on this by Hallstrom 1960: 332). One could argue that human society is present in the rows of people staffing the many elk-boats in Namforsen. This is the type of moteme in which rows of stick people depictions actually occur at this site. On the other hand, human figures are otherwise always depicted as operating on their own. Mainly two types of human figures can be singled out: ambiguous people and \"plain\" people. Concerning the last category, an interesting feature appears when regarding the panels containing the great herds of elks. Thus in the Noton panel (Figure 4.53) as well as in the panel depicted in Figure 4.5, a number of human figures are depicted among the elks. These people are not grouped together, but _mixed in with the elks_; they do not carry any weapon or object, and neither do they seem to be engaged in any kind of activity. Rather they stand still with their hands stretched out. This passive posture gives the impression that the humans are surrendering to the animal forces. Moreover, the mix of single human figures \"here and there\" among the animals expresses a total human immersion with the elk herd. This kind of human immersion with the elk could be said to be repeated in the elk-boat moteme, in cases where this swimming elk's belly is staffed with people and elk-people as well as \"plain\" elks. Whether this represents a Namforsen style of representing human society could certainly be a point of discussion. However, the general impression of \"immersion\", or imbrication, with the animal world - either within a herd or an elk boat - really does not suggest the same focus on human sociality as is the case in Alta Phase 1. Once again it should be mentioned that Namforsen otherwise is poor, or totally bereft, of circle imagery and of graphic designs. Comparing Namforsen to Alta Phase 1 and Vingen, it appears that the former also lacks a central element of the two others; Alta phase 1 and Vingen both contain motifs expressing the _control_ of animal herds. In Alta this is first and foremost communicated through corrals, while in Vingen it is expressed through the arrangement of deer head poles. One example of this can be given with reference to Figure 4.18, in which a few red deer are surrounded by a herd of head poles. This can be seen as a variant of the principle of encirclement of animals and expresses control. Another example could be where a herd of head poles is confronting one deer only. In this panel, the one deer certainly meets a stronger party, and would practically be overwhelmed and powerless. Still, it should be admitted that a version of the same confrontation moteme is present in Namforsen (Figure 4.54 upper section), in the elk-boat - staffed with people, elk-poles and elks - confronting one elk. Both motifs contain a single big game animal on the one hand confronting a number of ambiguous persons on the other. Perhaps the control element of the second Vingen example should not be taken too far. In any case, the comparing of the two motemes reproduced in Figure 4.54 illustrates the fact that the _difference between seduction of game and controlling it_ is blurry. This is not to say that lines of demarcation between moteme types are to be torn down. I still contend that corrals and other expressions of encirclement do communicate control, more than in cases of seduction. Yet this example demonstrates an area of transition, both with respect to hunting practice, as well as to visual practice. For as stated earlier, there is a blurry line of demarcation between taking control of solitary game, or a herd, and the techniques used to lure the animal. Simultaneously there is a blurry dividing line between confrontations between big game and ambiguous human persons on the one hand, and strictly taking control on the other. For even if promoting the circle as an idiom of full (encircled) control - and of humanity and human society - it should be remembered that the design in the corral fences in Alta partly are transformations of elk-people in a circle/row! In this way we confront the fact that visual transformations are possible due to visual ambiguities. Thus, blurry lines between figure categories, even if sometimes disturbing, should not be a problem but be conceived of as the very _raison d'etre_ of analogical reasoning. Without blurriness and ambiguities a visual analogical logic would not be possible as a modus operandi of the Mesolithic people, and neither would it be possible to make it an object of study thousands of years later."}
{"text": "To make my point clear, I believe there might be a structure above the motemic level, however, not in the shape of illustrated versions of myths. Gjerde's approach to a landscape structure, however, works agreeably on a structural level \"over\" the motemic base. I believe this method of micro-landscape works, first because it truly revealed a real structure underlying rock art making, and second, because it does not make any claim that rock art compositions are visual narratives. Whichever way this may be, my main point here is that the concept of moteme and motemic variation is an approach that works methodically on its own. It reveals the many variations in space. So, even if the motemic concept implies a structural level above, this level will not be pursued in this work. The fuller reason for this was discussed in the preceding chapter. Expounding the motemic concept provides us with an understanding of rock art that, if accepted, in some respect is exhaustive. Recognizing that my approach does not capture the entire analogical web of the Mesolithic mind, I have earlier expressed that this concept is _not_ to be seen as exhaustive. So, when at this point claiming that it may be so, in _some sense_, this is with reference to the fact that the motemic concept captures a basic structure underlying the large bulk of rock art products on the Scandinavian peninsula. Certainly the leitmotif underlying the motemes would form the leitmotif in Mesolithic mythic narratives as well. Thus, if we had access to real Mesolithic myths, and were to analyze their _mythemic_ structures, we would probably find that a large part of them related to the Mesolithic leitmotif, as it is defined here. From the same leitmotif at least two strands of mythical logic would have originated: mythic narratives and rock art (motemes). I consider this origin in a common leitmotif to form the basic relationship between rock art and myths. Again we are talking about two modes of mythical thinking - 'visual thinking' and thinking through stories. At this stage, rock art and'meaning' should once again be addressed. Rock art in this context may, as always, have multiple meanings, but underneath is a level of meaning residing within the leitmotif. Hence the meaning of rock art is the contents of the leitmotif, which is the never-to-be-resolved relationship to big game and their parallel world. Hunters' rock art of this context thematizes the leitmotif through motemes, and motemes are basically repetitive realizations of this structure. To repeat my suggestion from the last chapter: _Rock art is like music; it is the aesthetic experience of a theme that is repeated, varied, twisted, turned and inversed_. Not disregarding the ritual situations of rock art making, it may be defined as the Mesolithic mind's free play of visual thought. The basic level of meaning is created by the order of the leitmotif (human-animal enigma, structure or opposition), a meaning realized in motemes. Thus, an approach to the meaning of rock art in this context underlies the study of motemic variation. Meaning is order (structure of leitmotif) and meaning is its (motemic) variation. The idea of understanding rock art by way of an analogy to music is inspired by Levi-Strauss's use of this as the main analogon for myths and mythic variation. Now, my use of this analogon does not come from a wish to indiscriminately transfer this theoretical system for its own sake. The music analogy is chosen because it works as a device for an extended understanding of the \"state of the art\" achieved here. Apart from that, it is not my intention to stretch this analogy beyond the point where it is no longer productive. To Levi-Strauss, however, the relationship between myths and music is more than an analogical relationship. This rather involves a position that myths and music are in some sense really the same, through their structural similarities. The _Mythologiques_, Levi-Strauss claimed, could by a competent composer be transferred to a musical work (cf. references in Chapter 3). For me, the rock art-music relation is an analogy - perhaps it could be more, but at this point that issue lies beyond my intellectual capacity. Music as an analogy suffices for now. Nevertheless, the consequence of this Levi-Straussian inspiration is the creation of an analogical link between myths, motemes and music. This, however, would be at odds with Levi-Strauss's suggestion to understand the relationship between visual art and music. As taken up at the end of the last chapter, these two art forms make oppositions of a chiasm structure. Recalling this, his contention would be that painting is a movement from nature to culture, whereas music is a movement from culture to nature. More concretely, to make visual figures, colours are imposed on a canvas so that natural material is transformed to a cultural product. Making music, on the other hand, requires cultural products like a tonal system and instruments, but comes out as a product of nature - that is, pure sound \"ready\" for direct perception. Immediately one would be apt to liken rock art with painting. This is where I object, on the basis of my claim at the end of the last chapter; if Levi-Strauss had had knowledge of northern hunters' rock art, his systems concerning wild thinking would probably have been rearranged - or, exceptions would have been made for the case of rock art. Such an exception was made for the phenomenon of so-called concrete music, as the basic chiasm structure does not work for this class of music, which is \"music\" not relying on a specific tonal system, but made of sounds directly from nature. Thus Levi-Strauss admitted that the case of concrete music is more on a par with painting. So, at this point, I would claim, that the chiasm system could be attributed with one more exception, in which the motemes of hunters' rock art is placed beside myths and music. How far, then, is the paralleling of music and rock art interesting? Explanations and interpretations of meaning of a musical piece may take place through the words of language, but such assessments are almost totally divorced from experiencing it. Music is invested with a type of meaning that cannot be satisfactorily explained, let alone experienced through any other communicative system than itself. Its meaning in the end can only be experienced. Thus, by way of aesthetic means, music targets our emotional experience of deeply felt existential issues, in other words, topics that are _intellectual_ in the way this concept is used here. Moreover, the meaning of music is unfolded through the musical theme's many variations. In this chapter, I have tried to demonstrate how the motemes of rock art may be regarded as variations of a theme. In this way, it shares some essential features with music. Motemes are expressions of existential issues being \"thought of\" and experienced through the means of an aesthetic medium. This also concerns music. Still I think we must admit that motemes are much easier to explain through language than is the case with music. There might be some of the same structural similarities between music and rock art variations as there are between music and myths. More importantly, music and visual analogical logic share a strong aesthetic value implying that their understanding is imbricated in our experiencing of them. This complicated material, implying a further theoretical discussion of the relationship between rock art and music, will not be pursued further. One aspect, referring to a discussion in the last chapter, will however be brought forward as justification for comparing music and motemes. I would like to point out that the \"original\" chiasm structure of Levi-Strauss makes sense, if one exclusively discusses traditional paintings: a motif in a frame. According to Schmidt's (2008: 166, 168) understanding of Levi-Strauss's original contention, his point would be that myths, like music, need the temporal dimension to unfold, and that the timely experience is needed to understand the entirety. In other words, to know pieces of this kind of art, time is a prerequisite."}
{"text": "This is illustrated by a traditional painting, which is a motif that can be captured in the perception of just one gaze. According to the original chiasm system, painting therefore lacks the temporal dimension. However, the scientific understanding of rock art also, in some sense, needs this temporal dimension to be experienced and understood. It needs time insofar as it is spread out in space. Thus, myths and music are variations unfolded through time, whereas motemes are variations unfolded through _space_. Concluding this chapter, it is important to offer a final statement concerning rock art as art. Certainly, rock art is _also_ art. Thus, similar to 'rock art as text', a negation of 'art for art's sake' has turned our thinking away from focusing on rock art as an aesthetic experience for its makers and users. The application of music as an analogon for understanding hunters' rock art opens the gateway to this essential aspect. For, as pieces of art, they bring together intellectual excursions with aesthetic experience; in other words, rock art like music unites the senses with the rational (Levi-Strauss 1969b: 399; Wiseman 2007, especially 58-79). \"rt lies half-way between scientific knowledge and mythical or magical thought\", says Levi-Strauss (1966: 22). This is the core of wild thinking as expressed through visual media. Rock art in our context does not only represent a mediation between the human and the animal world, but rock art - as art in general - may be viewed as a mediation between mind and nature."}
{"text": "Addressing this, however, I have already implied that there probably is _some_ connection between representations of nature and those of culture. How can the example of the Askollen elk contribute to a deeper understanding of this transition? Or, rather, could such a transition be found in this elk? The elements above referred to as \"chops\" are testimony to the fact that this elk's body contains what could be called _lines added upon nature_. These are lines that definitely have no reference in a natural element. Another example of this phenomenon could be noted in the representation of the heart, by the two vertical lines having been added within its outline. These two lines cannot be traced back to natural reality. Such an addition is also evident in what Mikkelsen (1977; 175) described as representing the outline of the elk by a \"double back line\". Such a double line, indeed sometimes represented as a triple line, is also found along the belly of the animal, a fact emphasizing the extra line as a cultural artifact. Within these horizontal double lines, short perpendicular lines are added in between; in this way the \"chops\" are created. Thus, so far, we may conclude that the _Askollen elk contains ambiguous natural elements with lines of culture added_. Before a more clear conclusion on this depiction is achieved, we shall dwell a little more on the phenomenon of ambiguity. In this figure, the most intriguing example of ambiguity is represented in the earlier discussed antlers (cf. Chapter 4). The identification of the elk's antlers as such was never addressed in the discussion with the zoology professor. In retrospect it can be stated that it was not taken up due to the fact that it is certain, and therefore totally implicit. In other words, there cannot be any doubt that this part of the figure represents antlers. Still, it should be remarked upon that these antlers have little in common with their natural model - there is no main beam with its characteristic points. As pointed out earlier, this antler might as well be a representation of a boat staffed with people. Alternatively, it _is_ a boat; the antlers therefore are _both_ antlers and a boat at the same time. This specific representation of a boat could, however, not come about if the natural antler had not provided the outset. It is a boat, and also an antler and we may ask - are the vertical lines of the boat the natural points of an elk's antler, or is it a representation of humans-in-a-row? These same \"fringes\" were suggested to be represented in the half-circle on the antler of an elk figure at Mollerstufossen (cf. Figure 4.56 and compare Figure 4.4). The Askollen elk is perhaps primarily an outstanding example of ambiguity; it does not give clear answers as to the transition between depicting natural elements and design patterns proper. To the extent that the latter is present, there is rather a gap, or a _discontinuous_ relationship, between the two. Natural elements indeed exist, even if ambiguous in nature. Upon these, cultural lines are added. The latter do not seem to have \"originated in\" any of the natural parts. The noted connection between the antler points and the crew in the boat may make an exception. This contention is still made with some caution, for the transformation of these fringes into the vertical line pattern proper is absent in the elk - unless one regards the \"chops\" as a representation of this design. I will not give definite answers to these last questions, the material at hand does not provide enough evidence; the elements of the Askollen elk are simply too ambiguous. Thus, this elk figure expresses, in its entirety, a vague relationship between nature and culture, or alternatively, nature _culturalized_, and culture _naturalized_ (compare Glorstad et al. 2004: 106). The latter variety is best exemplified in the antler-boat. We might say that the antler has transformed into a boat, by way of a visual analogical logic. What should also be pointed out is that the Askollen antler is a brilliant example of how the wild mind has visualized, and represented, \"nature' and 'culture' as mirroring each other. They are areas in which _the one is the other's continuation_. Another way of expressing this is to say that _nature and culture impose on each other's visual representations_. Once more, it can be stated that art mediates between nature and mind. The Askollen elk is thus an imprint in stone, on how nature creates a basis for thinking and categorization through which it becomes part of an exclusively human symbolic world (Levi-Strauss 1966). On a preliminary level, it can be concluded that the investigation of the Askollen elk confirms that there is a relationship between the depiction of natural organs and the existence of body fill, albeit not exactly in the way we had expected. For so far, there are no observations allowing us to state there is a direct connection between the depiction of natural organs and the development of _design patterns proper_. Based on the \"Askollen boat\", which contains stick people, or \"fringes\", one could have argued that the vertical line pattern in eastern Norway, similar to what was concluded concerning the Alta rock art, originates in the humans-in-a-row - in this case made possible by its specific realization through an antler depiction. As will be obvious further on, there are more relevant ways of understanding the origin of this pattern within the eastern group of rock art. The further implication of the conclusion coming out of this investigation would be that the Askollen elk is ambiguous about the relationship between natural organs and graphic designs. The only confident conclusion to be made is that its body fill contains two main element categories: ambiguous natural elements and added cultural lines. The last activity is, however, not only about adding, but also of \"filling in of spaces\". As we shall see, this filling in and adding of lines is even more typical of the nearby site at Skogerveien. We will see if the examination of this site brings us closer to a more concrete transition between the depiction of natural organs and the reproducing of graphic design in animal bodies."}
{"text": "### Skogerveien The site _Skogerveien_ in Drammen, Buskerud (Petersen 1917; Engelstad 1934: 35-52; Hallstrom 1938: 513-529; Mikkelsen 1977: 149) (59 m a.s.l.), is similar to Askollen in that it is situated along the shore area of the Mesolithic version of the Drammen fjord. At this site, body fill has the appearance of a graphic design proper. Engelstad (1934: 83-84) described the Askollen body fill as a \"chaos of lines\", while the whale figure at Skogerveien was described as an \"irregular net\". We have already touched upon what could be the technical origin of _parts_ of this design, through the examination of the Askollen elk. Apparently small vertical lines have been filled in between the horizontal double lines running parallel with the back and belly. As is obvious from Figure 5.3, such adding of extra lines along the top and bottom of the animal's torso seems to characterize the majority of the animal depictions at Skogerveien. In several of these, the shorter vertical lines have been added between the double horizontal lines. This element is also present in the largest whale figure. Thus so far, we have identified only one element among many, of the structure which makes up the Skogerveien design. The body fill of the swimming bird depicted in panel B seems to be created exclusively by way of this system. In all other cases this structural element appears along the margins of the torsos only, and does not explain the process by which the main parts of animals are filled with this multifarious pattern. Another point to be addressed is the role played by what, during the examination of the Askollen elk, were defined as depictions of ambiguous natural elements. To approach the origin of this design a first step could be to compare the three elk figures reproduced in Figure 5.4. The elk to the left is the least adorned of the three. Following from the examination of the Askollen elk, it is however obvious that the few inner elements depict natural organs, i.e. trachea and heart ('lifeline') and midriff muscle. Otherwise this figure must be regarded as empty. Moving on to the elk figure in the middle, we see how it is reproduced with several elements already identified, like the three horizontal lines running along the back, and whose space is partly filled with vertical lines that create the typical design along the torso's margin. Furthermore, in the left compartment of the torso are two rounded elements that bring to mind figural elements in the elk to the left, but primarily in the elk from Askollen. The two elements may represent heart and abdomen, in other words, ambiguous natural elements. Yet, being non-geometrical, and rounded in form, they may be seen to bear a resemblance to the typical irregular outline of some of the squares of the filled-in graphic net design, as they appear in the elk to the right and also in the whale figures. I would contend that, in this way, natural organs have _partly_ provided the visual idea of the smallest unit of this Figure 5.4: Compilation of three elk figures from Skogerveien (see reference of Figure 5.3). net design. Another characteristic feature of the elk in the middle are some principal lines. Two of them are vertical lines and their visual origin could be the midriff muscle. Obviously, the earlier identified extra lines along the back can be classified under this type of principal lines. In addition to these, other principal lines run more or less perpendicular to the ones just mentioned. One of them is a prolongation of the front leg. Apart from that, the figure is characterized by some indefinite units, similar to the natural ambiguous elements just mentioned. From this we may infer that the ingredients of this elk's body fill are _ambiguous natural elements and a number of principal lines_. This realization, however, does not bring us very much closer to an explanation of the seemingly more complete design reproduced as body fill in the elk to the right. _Intuitively this elk's pattern stands out as a refined version of the Skogerveien graphic design_. Whether this proves to be the case or not, the compilation of the three elk figures does not yield an answer to the origin of the more standardized impression given by the body fill in the elk to the right. The origin of an eventual Skogerveien design par excellence could be approached by studying the development of body fill of two whales in panel A and B, respectively (cf. Figure 5.3). A closer visual study of these figures reveals a process, which could be described as an adding of principal lines, creating spaces that in turn are filled with more lines. It appears as if this process, at every stage, \"allows for\" or \"invites\" the filling in of new lines so that increasingly smaller spaces becomes the result. This system of building up the body fill in the whale at Skogerveien (section A) has also been observed by Bakka: On the large whale there is one line from the snout to the bulb inside the body, and another, median line from head to tail. The latter line starts at a transverse line which sets off the head from the rest of the body. The three lines mentioned here must be earlier than the large majority of other lines inside the whale, as they belong to a system which fills out the space between the primary lines and the body contour. (Bakka 1975: 32) This process is very much in line with the one already described for the elk figures. Bakka defines the process of drawing as structured by the filling in of the spaces formed by a few initially sketched principal lines. To a large extent we could be confident with this description as an explanation for the origin of this body fill. However, studying the body fills in Skogerveien reveals that this cannot be the whole story. If this really was the full explanation of the origin of this design, we would have ended up with a pattern of squares that, even if \"distorted\" and oblique in their execution, would still be more or less quadratic. Looking even closer at the patterns, however, reveals that this is not quite the case. The smallest units are represented in a wide variety of shapes - from the most regular quadrant to features that are impossible to describe by any geometrical term. The investigation that this book is founded on involves the close study of all existing design patterns within our study area. Part of the work has been to try to standardize every type of graphic and to represent them as the refined version, or version par excellence of the site, area or region in question. It is interesting to note how all my early attempts of \"defining\" the Skogerveien type failed. To address this problem, an attempt to \"tear apart\" the fill in the two whale figures has been made. The immediate impression of the whales' body fill would be that they appear as having \"departed\" even more from nature, at least when compared to what was the case at Askollen. This might be a correct judgment. Even so, we shall see that natural organic elements, even if ambiguous in fashion, are embedded in the pattern. One of the principal lines of the whale in Section B runs from the back fin and _almost_ all the way to its nose, and might be a representation of the spinal column.  The whale in Section A has a clear 'lifeline', to which a fully scooped-out representation of the heart is attached. In addition there is another natural element drawn in bas-relief in the whale's head area, but external to the outline of the animal. But there are more natural elements. Figure 5.5 delineates entities of the whales' body fill pattern that cannot have come about as a result of filling up empty spaces. On the contrary, they seem to have been involved in the beginning phase of decorating this mammal's body fill. By their featuring some versions of soft tissue, they are figural elements in \"their own right\". Hence, we may single out an area containing ambiguous natural elements. My further proposition as to the development of the stages of filling the whale figures in Skogerveien Section A and B, respectively, is shown in Figure 5.6."}

{"text": "Finally, it may seem that the vertical line pattern of the inland and the square pattern at Ekeberg are developments from the ASG phases of drawing. The inland sites may represent a standardization of Phase IV, whereas the Ekeberg design may be a straightforward example of the making of the principal lines of Phases I-III, or alternatively the Skogerveien design proper \"made even\" (Phase IV-V). The scenario suggested has implications for how we regard social integration within the eastern Norwegian area during the Late Mesolithic. On the immediate level, however, it has implications for the relative chronology of the sites of the eastern group. A discussion of chronology is found in the Appendix to Chapter 5."}
{"text": "### The structure and origin of graphic design in eastern Norway The emerging result from this chapter's investigation is that body fill in eastern Norwegian rock art, if spoken of in terms of patterns proper, contains three types of design (Figure 5.10).Peculiarly enough, however, all three designs seem to have a common origin in a specific _schema operatoire_ of drawing body fill initially practiced in the region of the ASG complex.  The Skogerveien design could be described as cultivating the very last phase of Figure 5.10: Idealized representations of the refined Skogerveien design and designs in Hedmark-Oppland and Ekeberg-Utenga (illustration IF, tracing HV). drawing (Phase V, cf. Figure 5.6 and .1), however, reproduced with uneven squares and with possibilities of detecting a residual double back line. The Ekeberg-Utenga design is a cultivation of Phases II/III or V. In this case - and unlike Skogerveien - the lines involved are reproduced with straight angles, creating a proper square pattern in which lines stand perpendicular to it. The Hedmark-Oppland design could be seen as a cultivation of Phase IV. A fuller compilation of rock art designs of Mesolithic Scandinavia will be continued in the coming chapter. The question to be addressed here is the origin of design patterns, of which the most flammable issue is their eventual relation to an imaginary early stage of drawing only natural organs, from which design patterns have developed. In the last chapter we saw that design patterns in other parts of the Scandinavian peninsula do not originate in natural organs. Yet, as stated several times in the beginning of this chapter, there might be other paths to developing of body fill designs. Given the fact that the eastern Norwegian group clearly shows some relationship to inner natural organs, and given that earlier scholars have posed the question as to the origin of this relationship, this question will now be given attention and discussed on the basis of the results achieved in this chapter. I will discuss this on the basis of the list of suggestions on the origin of patterns proper, as these are extracted from the texts of earlier scholars and listed in an earlier section. The two first statements will, however, make up the most central part of this discussion. The very first contention is that body fill, as graphic designs, has developed from a practice of depicting soft and hard inner organs. The second is a similar statement, but places a special weight on the ribs. Nonetheless, the conception is that these natural elements have developed into design patterns due to a process in which elements are schematized. This involves that the elements in question would have been simplified and in turn reproduced in a repetitive manner. The first commentary to this has already been implied; it presupposes an original phase of drawing of exclusively natural elements that are unambiguously reproduced. It seems that scholars of rock art implicitly have taken such an imaginative original state of body fill into their consideration, without ever really addressing the question of whether these types of figures actually exist. As we know, such a phase is not found in the rock art record we have at hand. We have many reasons to assume that the rock art makers were familiar with the inside of the animals and, furthermore, that they would have had the artistic ability to reproduce them \"correctly\" if this was the intention. Yet, from the conclusions to be drawn after this chapter's study of body fill, this seems not to have been the intention. Even the Askollen elk - on the immediate level the figure \"closest to nature\" in this group of rock art - is characterized by what I called 'ambiguous natural organs' and 'lines added upon nature'. At Skogerveien we documented a continuation of these two strands of filling the animal bodies. Moreover, at this site and at most of the remaining sites of eastern Norway we witness a cultivation of parts of the drawing process, assuming that the whale in Section A at Skogerveien includes the entire drawing scheme connected to the symbolic context in question. An important digression to be made here is how the whale in Section B seems to include these phases as well, even if appearing more ambiguous in this matter. However, what makes the B-whale an intriguing example is exactly its ambiguity, that is, the \"extended\" blurring between (ambiguous) natural organs and principal lines. Thus, as it appears, the intention of the rock art makers was this: ambiguity. I would contend that this \"ambiguous intention\" concerns nature and culture. Therefore, we cannot conclude that the practice of filling animals' torsos with design patterns proper emerges out of depicting natural organs. Rather, it can be said that in eastern Norway _it originates in a play between ambiguity and a visual logic thematizing the continuation of nature in culture and culture in nature_. Even if some of the natural elements can be identified, and even if others are ambiguous to us but not necessarily to native Mesolithic people, the degree of ambiguity is strong enough to represent this intention - and this intention is that the spectators should not be able to tell nature from culture. This conclusion is especially relevant for the ASG complex, and at Skogerveien, \"ambiguous nature\" is successfully intertwined, more and more, within a complex net pattern that to the immediate gaze stands out as \"pure culture\". As was attempted to be demonstrated, Skogerveien thus represents the best example of including nature in culture, or alternatively, of \"obscuring\" nature within cultural lines. In the next phase of rock art making in eastern Norway however - the one of design patterns proper (cf. Figure 5.10) - designs no longer bear links to nature. It seems like the relation to nature is detached, even if a very last residue of nature is present in the uneven squares of the Skogerveien design proper. Natural organs do exist in conjunction with patterns proper, however, mostly as lifelines \"tacked onto\" the standardized design. At this stage of development, life lines clearly break with the design patterns. Another way of putting this is to say that they are not integrated in the design. Contrary to the early phase in which (ambiguous) nature seems to be continued within cultural lines, this phase express a discontinuity, in other words, a clear demarcation between depictions of ambiguous natural elements and what is clearly a cultural pattern. Not to be forgotten, the ambiguous natural elements are not always present. This _non-presence_ of lifelines \"stuck onto\" design patterns proper is the rule in the rest of Scandinavia. If present at other places, it probably reflects contact with the eastern Norwegian region. The conclusions to be made concerning the origin of graphic designs exclusively concern the eastern Norwegian group of rock art. This could be summarized in the following way: the drawing development of graphic designs originates in a practice of depicting compositions that express a continuous relationship between nature and culture. The cultivation of some elements of this process has led to the development of designs that have no apparent link to depictions of natural elements. The claims of earlier scholars, that graphic designs have their origin in a practice of depicting natural organs is in some sense correct, with the additional caveat that the original practice in question is the drawing of _ambiguities and continuities between nature and culture_. At this point it is relevant to bring forward a contrary contention found in the list of earlier scholars, namely that graphic designs have no references or connection whatsoever to depictions of natural organs. This conclusion is also correct in the sense that the refined patterns really cannot be said to have any visual links to nature. For, as we have seen, the refining process takes its point of departure in standardization of what was acknowledged as 'lines added upon nature' - that is, principal lines, perpendicular lines and the final drawing of squares (cf."}
{"text": "Figure 5.6 and .1). Yet - and this cannot be emphasized enough - the added lines have a relation to nature by the fact that they exist in a context where they are exactly this - _added_, and as such are (ambiguous) nature's _continuation_. In the preceding I described earlier scholars' contentions as being permeated by a striking indeterminacy in this matter. We now understand why, for this recognition is presupposed by a full acknowledgment that visual ambiguity is the original intention of the creators of this art. In particular this concerns the ASG complex and sites like Stein. Having seen these panels, I would claim the following: just as _we_ feel indeterminacy as to the visual distinction between nature and culture, so would also the Mesolithic people have experienced this art, at least those alienated to the process of its making. Hence, the indeterminacy found in the literature just mirrors the intended ambiguity of the creators of this group of Late Mesolithic rock art. So far, conclusions are given on the two first points of the list of suggestions proposed by earlier scholars. These points, however, also included a notion that development of designs involved a schematization of forms. It also included the contention that especially ribs play a part in the development of graphic designs. In Chapter 4 I identified a process of visual transformation in which various versions of people, or humans-in-a-row had developed into types of graphic designs, that in turn fill animal figures, geometrical figures and corral fences. Of the cases reported, just one had been acknowledged before, but did not yield further considerations about development into graphic designs. Thus, both Engelstad and Hallstrom (see references in Chapter 4) saw that the \"row of dancing men\" at the Ovnen panel at Lake Nisservatn, Telemark, had transformed into a specific type of zigzag. They called this'schematization'; as described early in this chapter, this concept has been central to understandings of developments in hunters' rock art in Scandinavia. As far as I can see, this case is the only concrete observation of schematization reported earlier. This specific type of what I have called transformations, involves whole human or human-like bodies simplified and reproduced in a repetitive manner. When earlier scholars discuss schematization in the context of studying body fill, however, depictions of natural _elements_ are the only objects referred to as having undergone this process. This is, of course, a consequence of the fact that discussions on the origin of body fill have exclusively revolved around the schematization of natural organs. The results of investigations in this chapter, however, suggest a schematization to have taken place when 'lines added upon nature' are reproduced in a straightforward manner and create either the vertical line pattern (Oppland and Hedmark) or the square pattern (Ekeberg and Utenga).  In earlier literature, such a process is implicitly taken into account when ribs in particular, are given a special significance as the outset for developing this kind of body fill design. However, and as I have suggested, the vertical line pattern in the eastern context developed from Phase IV of the drawing process documented from Skogerveien. The relation to nature is only to be considered indirect and ambiguous. Hence, the notions of a direct origin of the vertical line pattern, as it were, \"from ribs\", must be abandoned. An important digression needs to be made before proceeding to other points on the list. In Chapter 4, the vertical line pattern was explained as originating in simplifications and repetitions of'stick-people'. In eastern Norway, compositions related to the visual analogical relationship between the humans-in-a-row and circle signs have also been found, albeit rarely. The few examples belong to arrangements of'stick people' in the antler from Mollerstufossen (a row of humans anchored to a half-circle) and the Askollen elk's antler (a row of humans in an antler-boat). The same symbolism is probably involved in the antlers of the great elk from Utenga. So, even if this symbolism is present in eastern Norway, I have concluded that in this region, a different path of transformation is involved in the development of this design. An urgent question is thus whether we are confronted with more than one path of origin - and accordingly different types of \"meaning\" - involved, but \"accidentally\" resulting in what is visually the same design. For Vingen, I have implied that the presence of the vertical design could be the simplest variety of the 'bundle of deer head poles', as was documented to be the origin of the Ausevik-Vingen design par excellence. Alternatively, I implied that it might simultaneously be due to contact with northern Norway, or a situation of commonality in the use of visual signs covering larger regions. From this point of view, eastern Norway now appears to be part of such a commonality. Thus, the origin of the vertical line pattern appears to be \"local\" and manifold, however with a common visual result. I would, therefore, propose that the commonality of this visual result played a part in the communication between people of different regions. As I will come back to in the chapter to come, different origin stories creating visually the same type of design should not be regarded a \"problem\", but rather a dynamic that is typically involved in visual analogical logic. Going back to the list, the next two points to be addressed are suggestions that graphic designs have no meaning but are to be regarded as a mere habit of decoration. This habit had, implicitly one presumes, developed from another habit, namely the one of depicting natural organs. Again, we confront the false presupposition that rock art making in this context includes an early stage of adorning the inside of animal figures exclusively with unambiguous natural organs. With reference to what has already been concluded, this point can now pass without further comment. I will also more or less dismiss the claim that design patterns are void of meaning; this can be described as an art-for-art's-sake standpoint that all anthropological experience contradicts (e.g. Levi-Strauss 2012 ; Wiseman 2007). Still, and with reference to my final comments in the preceding chapter, it is possible _and_, I would claim, desirable to reintroduce the aesthetic factor in rock art studies. Attached to the listed art-for-art's-sake argument, however, is the claim that drawing of body fill exemplifies an _urge to fill empty spaces_. I find this claim, if not taken strictly literally, somewhat intriguing, as it echoes a fact that was encountered at Skogervien in particular. If not being an \"urge\", it is obvious that empty spaces have been filled. Using the scheme of drawing phases derived from the Section A whale at Skogerveien it was obvious that several of the other figures at the site only represented the beginning phases of this \"drawing program\", while spaces in other depicted animals were gradually filled and became increasingly smaller by the process of filling. The sense one gets when studying the \"unfinished\" figures in Skogerveien is that they are ready for further adornment. We may only speculate why nobody ever continued the process. Nonetheless, this filling of empty spaces created by the \"program\" of the design in question - and the possibility for discovering spaces not yet finished - is a phenomenon to be found in other regions. Such instances of empty spaces ready for further adornment is indicative of the fact that graphic designs, either as part of animal figures or in any other context, have come about as a process in phases. The time lapse between the phases is unknown to us; we may think of everything from hours to centuries. Between these extremes, alternatives could be months, years or decennia."}
{"text": "I would however suggest a time lapse that is closer to years and decennia than to centuries; after revealing the logic of intricacies and obscurities of the operational drawing scheme of the AS complex, it seems that finishing the figures (or not) presupposes a milieu in which this scheme is internally acknowledged. This in turn indicates that the figures originate in a specific group of people and/or their direct successors and associates. The next topic to be commented upon concerns a well-established position of our research history, namely the one that body fill is to be understood as part of sympathetic magic. This theory was directly inspired from North American ethnography and practices of drawing the animal prior to the hunt. In these examples, adding a 'lifeline' to the inside of the animals was explained as attempts to influence the forces of nature and bring luck in hunting. In the wake of the few'structuralist' approaches to rock art (see Chapter 2), and even more so, the more recent'shamanic' approach, this theory somehow lost its relevance. Contrary to this, I believe it has some applicability to rock art. Hunting magic is compatible with the kind of communication with the animal world, which we find within animic world views. I will come back to this in Chapter 7, in conjunction with discussions of animism versus cotemism. An argument to be forecasted, however, concerns Hagen's prolongation of this theory in his proposed'skeleton magic'. In this variety of the hunting magic theory, the original significance of the lifeline - \"original\" in the sense that it is taken directly from the ethnographic source - is transferred to the skeleton. Thus, the skeleton, or its falsely conceived consequence in a design pattern, is seen to mark the native understanding of the animals' essential parts, and as such, acts as a significant visual device to lure the game. I truly believe there are reasons to attribute body fill a great significance, and a status as \"essential\" parts of the animal. In line with this is also my adherence to the concept that body fills in rock art marks a shift to an 'inner focus'. As taken up earlier in this chapter, this way of thinking is also akin to Levi-Strauss's concept of _modele reduit_. What I reject is the coupling of designs with the type of communication typical of animism, for as will be argued in Chapter 7, the \"essentiality\" of graphic designs is more to be associated with cotemism. The identification of an element of the graphic designs as representing 'vulvas' demands comment. As we have seen, this was initially suggested by Bakka, but taken further by Mandt. The latter, similar to Gjessing (1936: 141), also explicitly considers body fill proper, what I call design patterns, as symbols of the feminine. When it concerns the 'vulva' figures, I do not come down on one side or the other. The suggestion is intriguing, and the investigation in Chapter 6 of this book addresses the 'vulva' and its possible further visual associations (and see discussion of 'chiasms' in the foregoing chapter). After the discussions in the preceding and present chapters, the suggestion that graphic design, _in general_, should be linked to female symbolism should be rejected. With reference to the investigation of Vingen, it could be concluded that this design originates in compositions of accumulated deer head poles; this is a process of visual transformation, whose \"origin figure\" (the head pole) bears no connotations to the female body, or for that matter, to that of the male. Viste's suggestion that design patterns originate in various visual phenomena conditioned by altered states of consciousness (ASC) is related to the general archaeological inspiration from the field of shamanism emerging in the nineties and a little later resulting in a number of \"trance tuned\" works on Nordic Stone Age rock art (e.g. Goldhahn 2002; Viste 2004; Walderhaug 2000). I will finally comment on the last point on this list, which offers an explanation for body fill, referring mainly to two facets of shamanism. The first concerns the shaman's dress during trance. This part of the shamanic explanation implies that body fill, when depicted on human figures, is plainly a representation of a shaman wearing his or her shamanic coat. The idea of this type of clothing, with a design referring to the human skeleton, is taken from ethnography and applied directly to understand human depictions in Vingen and Ausevik. The second facet of this explanation concerns rock art as a \"report\" on the shamanic vision quest, that is, a display of _entropic phenomena_ - or, the visual images appearing on the retina during a trance experience. In the first phase of trance, various geometric forms and patterns appear as a mere function of the human nervous system. They are, in a literal sense, universal images. The second and third phases are \"context dependent\"; in the second phase of ASC, the entopic phenomena will make more sense to the shaman, as the images he or she experiences are \"bent\" into familiar forms (i.e. features known from the life world of the shaman). The third phase involves combinatory compositions in which \"umans, animals, monsters and geometric figures are experienced in fantastic combinations\" (Viste 2004: 41). This approach is applied to the rock art areas of Vingen and Ausevik. A selection of design patterns from the sites are set up and compared with what has been defined as universal entopic phenomena appearing in the first phase of trance, that is, patterns of the plain neurological type (Viste 2004: Fig. 5.7). This compilation demonstrates full accordance between some entopic patterns and some of the graphic designs defined in this work. More concretely, entropic phenomena include bundles of vertical and horizontal lines, which are not visually different from the vertical line patterns. Square patterns also accord with entopic patterns of the first stage of trance. Finally, there is a likely relationship between entopic zigzags and hexagon patterns on the one hand and similar designs found in the Late Mesolithic rock art record on the other. With regard to some of the designs at Vingen and Ausevik, as well as designs in our study area at large, several, if not most - to various degrees - actually differ from entopic phenomena. How may this be explained? As described recently, the ASC theoretical formula opens for the possibility of regarding various degrees of context specific elements in the entopic figures. Consequently, this approach allows for possibilities of defining, literally speaking, _every_ pattern in the same manner; the \"plain\", neurological patterns as well as patterns similar to theses - and finally patterns without any resemblance whatsoever to its neurological outset - will all be regarded to have the very same origin. In other words, within the ASC approach all types of graphic designs may be explained and understood by this formula, as it opens the gateway to define all graphic patterns as essentially entopic, no matter the degree of resemblance with the original entopic phenomena. Not only that, the trance approach even explains all types of combinatory compositions, whether only a plain solitary animal or \"psychedelic\" combinations of say herds, humans and abstract signs, as visions of the third phase of trance. Thus accordingly, every panel of our rock art record may be traced back to representing a variety of occurrences of altered states of consciousness. In addition, compositions of a human adorned with body fill, is the shaman in action wearing his or her coat, and eventually carrying a drum. Shamanic phenomena are apparently capable of explaining it all. The scenarios provided by this \"shamanic package\" are overwhelming as it embraces both the universality of rock art, and simultaneously, the lived and symbolic context of its making. While maybe unexpected, this is exactly the starting point for my critique of the entropic approach. For it is seemingly waterproof in all directions. I would claim that this is also the symptom of its weakness."}
{"text": "The entopic concept may, on an immediate level, stand out as being extremely powerful. I would venture the analogy that it is like purchasing an excellent offer of the type \"all inclusive\", while at the same time being left with an uncomfortable sense that there will never be more to pursue. As stated earlier, the ASC theoretical formula allows for entopic signs to be stamped with varying degrees of context. Bringing in \"context\" to the theory may at first glance appear to be a great strength, and a sympathetic one, but in fact it makes this theoretical formula _as method_, totally useless. This position could be explained by presenting a fictive argument in favour of the ASC approach as an actual tenet that harmonizes with the ones chosen in this book. Such a fictive argument, albeit coming from an uninformed party, could probably be that universal structures should be of interest for someone propounding a Levi-Straussian approach. Would not the \"plain\" entopic phenomena exactly represent the universal mind? The simple reply to this is that the universal mind comes to expression through visual forms that are linked to the nature of a particular milieu at a particular time - in other words, a specific symbolic environment, or if you like, context. In the present work, I have so far investigated various paths of origin of vertical line patterns, zigzags, squares and hexagons, and by this demonstrated that patterns that may _appear to be_ (mere) entopic patterns are transformations of compositions linked to more or less local versions of a Mesolithic leitmotif. The similarity of these design patterns with entopic phenomena may be purely accidental, or alternatively they could be understood in combination with a scenario in which tranc visions play a part. At best perhaps, and in the words of Lahelma (2008: 14), \"the identification of hallucinatory imagery in rock art does not reveal its meaning, only its origin.\" However, as long as it is totally _impossible, methodically_, to demarcate what aspects, or which \"volume\", of a pattern belong to the universal and which are context-specific, the theory of entopic phenomena is not applicable. In effect, entropic phenomena, while surely existing on the retina during tranc (but see Helvenston & Bahn 2003), in practice has little relevance for rock art archaeology. This condemnation of the shamanic approach primarily concerns its inability to explain the origin of design patterns, by its poor methodological possibilities. Now \"theories\" in archaeology seldom deliver a clear method; mostly the methodical approaches are tailor-made for each and every case. However, if one is to derive a methodology from a theory, this theory must provide the possibility of developing such a one for the specific case in question; otherwise, the theory must be considered poor. The shortcomings of the shamanic concept lie in its undeveloped notions concerning \"distribution\" of the universal versus the local ingredient in a specific graphic design. Expressed in another way, how are we to measure the element, or degree, of \"universality\" in a design pattern, compared to that of \"context\"? Or alternatively, how can we know when the design is purely universal and when it is more dominated by its context? Once again one cannot but disapprove of the Three Stages of Trance (TST) model's lack of methodical possibilities. John Bradshaw has concluded similarly, as he writes: The problem with the 'Three Stages of Trance' hypothesis is that it is unnecessary, implausible and simplistic. In its most _general_ form, that various kinds of altered states of consciousness drove the art of the Upper Palaeolithic (Lewis-Williams & Dowson 1988), it is also very difficult to falsify or disprove, and so is _not very useful scientifically_. (Bradshaw 2003: 216, last emphasis mine) This contention appears in a comment to Patricia Helvenston and Paul Bahn's  article, which identifies a severe lack of correspondence between the features presumed envisioned during trance, and design patterns found in rock art. They argue that there is little evidence that the type of trance producing the images of the TST model actually took place. The authors investigate different types of trance, mainly the ones induced by drugs, but also those which are not - and found that the trance-producing images of the TST model was probably not in use during the Upper Palaeolithic. Indeed the trance initiated by other means (e.g. drumming) involves visions of geometric forms such as \"the cross, human face and triangles are not included in the TST-model\" (Helvenston & Bahn 2003: 215), and moreover, they are rarely found in cave art. Even if this discussion concerns Upper Palaeolithic cave paintings, it also has validity for Mesolithic rock art - in other words, these forms are rare. This is far from claiming that shamans and shamanic practices did not play a part in rituals and rock art making in the Mesolithic. Still, if we presuppose that shamanism _did_ play a role throughout the entire Mesolithic, a timely question to be posed is why Early Mesolithic rock art totally lack graphic designs. Does it mean that altered states of consciousness were not involved in rock art making during this phase, and that shamanism had different conditions in the Early Mesolithic than later? Whatever the answers to this question would be, we confront the fact that shamans, when present, never exists outside of the historical context. Hence, I once again contend that whether one is pursuing the historical development of Mesolithic societies - or, for that matter the universality of the mind exemplified through Mesolithic materialized expressions - it will be the specific historical setting that is of interest. The universality of human living is surely interesting, but the TST model does not bring us any closer to knowing more about it. Entopic phenomena are just what they are; their universality exists in the same manner as claiming it is universal for a human being to incorporate a specific nervous system, or for that matter, having human legs or arms. The inadequacy of this concept has also been addressed by Glorstad (2010: 215-216, 223-224; 2002, and see Bradley 2000: 30), and could be seen as a comment to my call for the need for context. Albeit not arguing on the basis of the TST model, his discontent with the shamanic approach targetsthe inherent lack of possibilities it possesses to study the regional and local preconditions of symbolic life, as he sums up:  are their bodies as a relation to the physical world. Still, their means to grasp and understand this world, including their own practice, are symbolic, and this symbolic systems constitute semi-independent systems of meaning (for instance shamansim). The shape and content of this semiotic must nevertheless be understood in the context of practical, physical life. It is in this situation the system of symbols is mobilized, and this practical life is the origin of cosmology. (Glerstad 2010: 216)\\({}^{26}\\) Thus, the specific semi-independent meaning systems coming out of local, practical living is the context upon which studies of shamansim should be founded. My own position is in line with this: shamansim is not irrelevant for the understanding of materializations of Stone Age rituals. Yet, applying the shamanic concept might divert it from its context. This is due to the fact that the concept is too general and the methodical devices that could take us beyond this generality have not been invented. When applied to Mesolithic Scandinavia, I would claim, it easily creates an ahistorical rock art archaeology. It inevitably yields an image of rock art making as being an activity carried out by marginalized people at remote places, operating outside of society and history. This said, I simultaneously feel the need to state my opinion that the shamanic concept should not be eliminated from rock art studies. Undoubtedly it does capture important aspects."}
{"text": "### Introduction: further analogical opportunities Design patterns appear in basically three contexts: either within the outline of an animal or human body; in frame figures, often a quadrant or rhomboid; or even depicted with no lines of confinement.We have also seen that designs make up the fill in a number of corral fences in the Alta rock art. In Kafjord Upper, there are even elk head poles adorned with body fill patterns. There are also numerous cases in which the same patterns \"cross\" different figure types. For example, the design recognized to be the Vingen-Ausevik design par excellence is reproduced not only in deer figures, but also in humans and as patterns independent of outline. In diverse panels in Alta we saw how the same patterns were present in elk figures as well as in the corrals surrounding them. Not touched upon earlier, but important to mention, is how the Kafjord Upper panel contains design patterns in snowshoes. In this chapter I will address the patterns as patterns, mostly independent of \"context of outline\", i.e. regardless of it constituting the inside of an animal or a geometric figure. In Chapter 4, evidence was given that a group of design patterns are outcomes of visual transformations. This was demonstrated by the different versions of humans-in-a-row and their transformation to design pattern. This phenomenon of transformation is close to what earlier scholars have called schematization, simplification or even abbreviation. As is obvious from the foregoing, I prefer to name it transformation. This new terminology is chosen for at least two reasons: one is to create a distance to earlier evolutionary-based notions on development in rock art; another is to signify that this phenomenon should be associated with the dynamic realm of the visual analogical logic. A third reason might be related to my experience that this is a typical and much more widespread phenomenon in Late Mesolithic rock art than what has been previously acknowledged. Transformation is the dynamics involving the \"bending\" of a composition into a similar, yet slightly different composition - different to the extent that its origin in the first composition is not immediately recognized. Thus, the origin is obscured within the pattern. Humans or human-animal hybrids in the row, through their transformation, become bundled, or accumulated within what have become mere patterns. This may stand for \"humanity concentrated\" or \"extra-society\", that is, an even stronger statement of the idea of society. The original meaning is slightly changed, in this case through an exaggerated cultivation of the original message. The group of patterns that were found to originate in different versions of humans-in-a-row can therefore be said to share an origin (Figure 6.1). They are analogically connected on an ideational plane, but the creation of the analogical connection - the one from human society to \"extra-society\" - was made possible through a transformation belonging to the area of visual analogical logic, in other words, the \"bending\" of forms to its similar, but different version. The essence of visual logic is its allowance for slight alterations or simplification of the visual forms. In this way, the visual realm offers a unique opportunity for the intellectual process, one which I have defined as visual reasoning or logic (cf. Chapter 4). Another aspect of such a visual analogical logic is the following: a specific design, _once created_ through transformation, will exist autonomously, that is, more or less detached from its origin. As a \"mere design\" prevalent in the Late Mesolithic symbolic milieu, it is ready to be associated with still other elements or phenomena of the natural world. It creates the possibility that figures may refer to each other through a purely visual affinity. In the following I will take a point of departure in the Figure 6.1: Standardized representations of designs, all of which can be traced back to an origin in the composition of humans or elk-humans-in-a-row (illustration by the author, tracing HV). diamond pattern and investigate some possible paths of further associations that this form might bring along."}
{"text": "### A reinforcement of connections Before specifically focusing on the \"further associations\" through similarity of form, some empirical examples that reinforce my earlier result concerning the designs' origin in row-of-humans compositions will be demonstrated.These are the diamond, zigzag, half hexagon, hexagon and single cross whose form is a plain X. I would like to show some examples where their common origin and mutual association is tangible, not only as a consequence of accepting the results of the investigations in Chapter 4, but also as material reality. As will be shown, they are often physically associated by the simple fact of being displayed together. Figure 6.2 shows some varieties of the diamond in different versions, its original context of appearance in the Kafjord corral fence (a) and as body fill in a reindeer (b). Referring to some of the considerations at the end of Chapter 4, we may say that this fill is externalized, or \"turned out\" and reproduced as varieties of mere patterns Figure 6.2: Examples of diamond patterns in the panel Kafjord Upper, Alta, Finnmark (documentation by Karin Tansem/Alta Museum 2005, compilation HV). (c-g). Varieties of this pattern also appear as a single rhomboid (h) or a chain of them (i). The last figure (i), however, represents a concrete association as well as confirmation that there is an affinity between diamonds and zigzags. Such a concrete relationship can be documented in practically all contexts where diamonds are present. An additional obvious element to mention is that the zigzag is inherent in the very feature of the diamond pattern. The co-existence of diamonds and zigzags appears to be a trivial fact; therefore no more examples of this connection will be given. The penultimate figure (h) is another example of what was suggested in the foregoing, namely of a relationship to the cross, which in this figure is virtually \"growing out\" of the diamond. Figure 6.3 shows a selection of crosses from the Alta rock art. The cross to the left in the lower row once again confirms the relationship between the cross and the diamond; in this instance, the diamond is depicted in Figure 6.3. Figure 6.3: Examples of cross design in panels in Alta, Finnmark (documentation by Karin Tansem/Alta Museum 2005 and 2009, compilation HV). as a \"continuation\" of the cross. The cross-diamond relationship is also confirmed in a section from the site of Forselv in Nordland. By the examples given, the analogical affinities can be confirmed on a different level than by the transformations, and demonstrations of common origin given in Chapter 4. These examples primarily establish a relationship between the diamond, the zigzag and the cross. However, turning our attention to the last mentioned site (Figure 6.4), we see how this composition _also_ incorporates a concrete link to the vertical line pattern, as this design admits some diamond figures, as well as appearing as additional fill pattern in the frame figure containing the cross. This illustration of a section from Forselv is, however, only one of several examples of a co-appearance with the vertical line pattern. Thus, the point I want to make is that there is a close association between the design elements internally - as not only visual _derivates of the same idea_ - but also that there is often a \"physical\" and concrete relationship of location. Thus, in some cases they even form constituents of the very same composition. This is the background on which the further journey of the diamond associations should be drawn."}
{"text": "### Patterns of association In the preceding section, I defined a group of patterns to be analogically connected and pointed out further analogical connections on the basis of similarity of forms.In this way I implied the \"further associations\" to have been secondary in the Mesolithic native mind's creative process. I do not necessarily contend that the patterns developed out of row-of-humans came first. However, it did come first in the mind of this author, and I admit that this is a scenario I favour. The further visual relations identified may of course be prior, parallel or secondary. To be focused on in this section is another aspect of the phenomenon that designs _once made, create their own dynamics_, following associations between visual forms. This idea of a further logic can be used as a device for reflecting upon the most frequent pattern of all: the vertical line pattern. We have seen principally two or even three paths of creation of the vertical line pattern. In Alta, the origin is obviously the row-of-(stick-)people; in eastern Norway, it reflects the cultivation of a phase in a specific _schema operatoire_ of filling figures. The Ausevik-Vingen design called 'collapse of line bundles' is a patchwork of different straight or bent line sets. Deer head poles, being its constituent, make it possible to see this pattern as a variety of a row-of-deer-humans. The vertical line patterns also exist in Vingen, and we may regard its appearance as basically related to the collage of line bundles;that is, simplified and reproduced as only one bundle. Thus, such a version of this design merges, visually, with the \"plain\" vertical line pattern. The creation paths revealed throughout Chapters 4 and 5 give reason to claim that the diverse vertical line patterns have different origins, in different local milieus. As pointed out in the introduction, Late Mesolithic rock art is characterized by this immense local variation, while at the same time displaying overwhelming indications of short- and long-distance contact between the regions. In this chapter, the claim has been to illuminate a consequence of the foregoing results; this is how the bulk of graphic design types seems to belong to the same reference system. Another way of putting this is to say that they were analogically connected elements of the Late Mesolithic mind. Alternatively, these elements could be said to mirror each other. But what does this imply on a concrete level, i.e. in the social lives of Mesolithic people? Commenting on this demands the foreshadowing of topics to be covered in Part II of this book. Here it will be argued that design patterns signify different clan groups. At this preliminary point, such a position may perhaps be justified if attention is directed towards conclusions already made concerning the majority of design patterns, namely their being strong statements of 'humanity' or 'human society'. Thus, if graphic designs stand for humanity, slightly different but analogically connected, they consequently stand for 'different versions of humanity'. Hence, the recorded design patterns may partly represent the fragmented materialization of Mesolithic social categorization. Archaic meetings involve \"mankind confronting mankind\"; one important aspect of arranging these meetings and the formation of affiliated parties, I would claim, lies in this dialectics of experiencing similarity versus difference and the mirroring of oneself in the meeting parties. The similarities and differences of design patterns could be seen to reflect this similarity and difference. What then if clan groups of the southeast, west and north meet, and confront the situation where their clan mark is visually the same? A possible scenario could be that the vertical line pattern becomes part of a symbolic repertoire in which the design is maintained, regardless of its local creation story. At meetings and situations of increasing contact, this design in particular, given its visual commonality, probably called for an extraordinary case of the previously described internal mirroring. \"Accidental\" visual similarities probably increased the experience of a tie, or union, to groups in different regions, while at the same time demanding the cultivation of slight internal differences. In such a scenario, a next step in the development of the vertical line pattern would probably ensue, aiming at creating a number of slightly different versions of this category of graphic design. I suggest this to be the explanation for the vertical line pattern's large distribution, its \"uneasy\" commonality, but also the way it is slightly varied throughout the Late Mesolithic landscape (Figure 6.14)."}
{"text": "This geographic fact has implications, which attribute the graphic designs with another value of context and meaning than what is the case with the decorated portable art. Moreover, the fact that several designs do not share any formal similarity with the older Mesolithic tradition of decoration, bears witness to the aforementioned _uniqueness_ of Late Mesolithic designs. Landscapes of 'clan markers' and of totemism will be the topic for discussion in Part II of this book."}
{"text": "Certainly, the analogical phenomenon is most strongly expressed in the Late Mesolithic, but all rock art, from the Early Mesolithic to the Early Neolithic, in some ways, bears testimony to a specific nature-culture relationship. On a preliminary basis we could define animism and totemism as denoting different ways of conceiving the nature-culture difference. Prior to the untangling of the terms animism and totemism, this chapter will devote attention to a review of how the nature-culture relationship is expressed in various local contexts of Mesolithic and Early Neolithic rock art."}

{"text": "Figure 4.3), is the line passing through the neck area, dividing the head or face from the rest of the animal body.  I hereafter call this figural feature the _bead-line_. I will comment upon this element further on. The phase of rock art making belonging to the earliest Late Mesolithic is expressing an outer focus.  The representation of nature is close to that of the Early Mesolithic, in other words, nature more or less as it is - or the animal as it appears when confronted in real life. Similar to the Early Mesolithic there seems to be an absence of human representations. "}
{"text": "### Late Mesolithic and earliest Early Neolithic The initial introduction to this body of material, and not least the application of the motemic concept as it was developed in Chapters 3 and 4, revealed the great diversity in Late Mesolithic rock art.The constituents of this variety shall not be repeated here; it shall only be stated that in this phase - in contrast to the earlier phases - the human element is strongly present. This presence is signified in human-made artifacts of the practical and symbolic order: animal head poles, boats and what we may consider as abstract art. Not least, human bodily existence is thematized and displayed in a variety of ways: as plain humans made by a few lines and \"stick-people\" represented more or less by one line, as well as various versions of human-animal hybrids, like figures of persons adorned with headgear of antlers and elk and deer head poles. These hybrid identities also involve boats, as elk-boats may be loaded with humans and humans carrying elk head poles. For the time frame from the Late Mesolithic to the Early Neolithic, the single rock art areas will be examined one by one, as this time span represents the human-nature continuities in a range of new ways. This investigation will not address whether a human figure is more or less 'naturalistically' represented. Our concern is rather the various interplays between animal and human bodies, and in turn, the inclusion of what is here defined to be the most prominent mark of culture and human society: the graphic designs. Before starting the investigation, it should be stated that words like \"plain people\" and \"stick people\" may occur. The first word refers to representations of beings that are unambiguously humans, and only this. The other word refers principally to the same; the \"stick\" is just to signal that the figure is abbreviated and may be represented as more or less a vertical line pattern, or as \"fringes\" or crew in a boat figure. If humans are depicted with antlers or other elements of an animal, this will be clearly expressed."}
{"text": "### From epistemology to ontology In the rock art studied here, I have defined figures depicting human-made artifacts in the broad sense, including abstract art-like graphic designs and 'lines added upon nature' as culture, whereas the remaining figural elements have implicitly been assigned to the realm of nature.Principally, this way of handling human artifacts is a total failure, demonstrating the limitations of the nature-culture conceptual pair. Indeed, art is a cultural product, and as such it will always \"fall victim\" to the human mind, and the _modele reduit_. To repeat a truism made earlier, all rock art is certainly cultural. In Chapter 5, I created a nature-culture demarcation between _depictions of nature_ (by humans), in opposition to _depictions of culture_. By doing this, it might seem as if I implicitly attribute the Mesolithic mind with a modern way of categorizing. In Chapter 1, I implied that this nature-culture usage is also a matter of convenience. This is, however, not necessarily always the case; it is also related to my use of a mind-nature concept of art, and with this a self-granted allowance to use concepts that are, to use one of Levi-Strauss's expressions, at an \"astronomical distance\" to the society under study. The convenient aspect of my use of these terms is related to shortcomings of alternative concepts. Investigating rock art and taking up the question concerning the origin of body fill patterns leaves me virtually with no other options. On the other hand, I truly think that the division, so far, has turned out to be productive. Approaching rock art in this way demonstrated the limitations of this divide; yet applying this conceptual pair, for instance to eastern Norwegian rock art, did not prevent me from revealing that nature did not seem to have existed as a distinct field of its own in the Mesolithic mind. Thus, I do not disregard current anthropology's advancements in the field of hunter-gatherer perception and the critical discourse concerning the Western \"invention\" of nature. Results in this book, so far, only demonstrate several possible \"beyonds\" of nature and culture in hunters' rock art. The first part of this chapter presented a compilation of the different contexts and the various ways in which they present human interference in the lives of significant animals. Despite the presumed limitations of a nature-culture dualism, this rock art somehow addresses this \"opposition\" or rather, \"continuity\". The outcome of this compilation was a profile of differences and similarities throughout the Mesolithic and Early Neolithic. Now, how could we take our understanding of the differences in question further? The aim in the coming sections is to investigate whether we may gain increased knowledge by discussing this profile of differences against two main ontologies. As explained in the introduction, this chapter - in fact this book - rests on a basic interest in the concepts of _animism_ and _totemism_. Before turning to a discussion of these labels, it should be made clear that they represent two ontologies that have been developed out of ethnographic material and then generalized. A central issue is thus how these general concepts can be made relevant for the Mesolithic of Scandinavia, but even more essentially, how animism and totemism can be used to explain rock art. More specifically, can animism and totemism be used to give sense to the profile of differences, including the previously described main line of division in Late Mesolithic rock art? The questions are as follows: Are animism and totemism manifest in rock art? Could they be adequate tools to help understand two main categories of figural expression? The answers are instantly positive. As stated above, the very rationale behind this work relies on a conviction that the animic and totemic concepts provide an approach that explains several empirical facts. In the aforementioned essay, _Beyond Nature and Culture_, Descola  maintains that four main ontologies have characterized humanity: animism, totemism, analogism and naturalism. 'Ontology' here specifically refers to the main conceptual framework through which a person interprets and perceives their world and the nature of eventual relationships between beings and elements of this environment. Descola takes a point of departure in what is now scientifically established to form a general and basic human experience, namely the one that involves perceiving oneself as consisting of a double faculty. This is the experience of having consciousness, intention or'soul' - and simultaneously, a physical constitution with related motoric. Descola names the former _interiority_ and the latter _physicality_ (Descola 2013: 116-121).17 The four ontologies can be thought of as dependent upon the answers given, when posing the question of whether an animal possesses the same interiority and/or physicality as us, the humans. Thus, the animic ontology regards animals as possessing the exact same interiority, or soul, as us, but not the same physicality. Totemism, on the other hand, sees a sameness of interiority _and_ physicality between specific humans and specific animals and/or other natural elements. Analogism regards beings of the world as neither sharing interiority nor physicality; however, the internal distinctions are seen to be very minute. This implies that differences between categories (elements or beings) potentially are only a question of degree.  In this way, it opens the gate for the construction of analogical links in many directions. Naturalism sees a sameness, or similarity, between animal and human physicality, but attributes animals with no interiority at all (e.g. Descola 2013: Figs. 7.1-7.5 and 7.8-7.9). The four ontologies are not mutually exclusive (see Descola 2006; 2013: 167); the point is rather that most contexts will be _dominated_ by one of the four. Analogism was dominant in medieval and Renaissance Europe, and taken over by naturalism at the beginning of modernity. I will not get into a thorough discussion on analogism and naturalism, even if this would certainly nuance my presentation of animism and totemism (but see Descola 2006; 2013: especially 91-171 and 247-280). Yet, a few basic points have to be discussed concerning _analogism_. As recently implied, analogism allows for the inclination to create \"endless\" analogies between things and phenomena of the world. Certainly, it seems that analogism has strong links with my Levi-Straussian-inspired 'analogical thinking'.  Therefore, it could be claimed that my concentration on animism and totemism clashes with my earlier chosen heuristic approach of visual analogical thinking. This, however, is only the case _if_ it is supposed that analogical thinking is a case of analogism. As implied above, we must admit this might be the case, one way or another. However, when reading Descola's presentation of analogism one is caught in a state of \"looking down\" on this ontology. This is perhaps due to the limitless types of analogies it opens up for, and with this, the somewhat bizarre relationships it creates. One historical example of analogism applied in early medicine, is the one that prescribes walnuts for brain disease; a logic originating in the two entities' similar textural appearance. I think this experience of analogism, as a kind of \"dodgy business,\" might be echoed in a statement made by Henaff, in his book on Levi-Strauss; where he calls analogical thinking a little \"outlandish\" (Henaff 1998: 144), and implicitly this communicates that such a dubious business is not what one would expect of Levi-Strauss's sober academic style. But then Henaff reminds us of an essential passage from _The Savage Mind_: The characteristic feature of mythical thought is that it expresses itself by means of a heterogeneous repertoire which, even if extensive, is nevertheless limited. It has to use this repertoire, however, whatever the task in hand _because it has nothing else at its disposal_."}
{"text": "Hybridity may play a part in hunting, but is also a theatization of a difference in clothing between humans and the elks, and the potentiality in both to change into the guise of the other party. Hybridity also concerns elks and a human-made artifact, the boats. Finally the location of the society of big game might be thematized in the motemes of diverging game in which the two directions represent the coming from, or going back, to the parallel world. It is also suggested that this other world of the animals is represented in depictions of game positioned in an upside down fashion, alternatively described as two elks mutually positioned in a kind of mirror-arrangement. From this it can be stated that most motemes could be seen as deriving from an animic world perception, in this context, especially related to hunting and the communication with big game animals and their community. The types of motifs involved correspond with the first main class of motemes, that is to say the ones thematizing the hunting cycle and communication with the animal society. A typically animic agency is modeled on the hunting cycle, as it exhibits the notion that life regenerates through an ongoing process of give and take between the two communities. The other and second main class of motemes, the ones themtizing human society, cannot immediately be categorized under animism. This is a matter that will be taken up for discussion further on. The main focus in this subsection, however, is a final clarification of what defines animic rock art. We shall be concentrating on big game animals. After expounding the animic concept it appears that what, according to this world perception, distinguishes a human or an animal as its own kind, is their dress, clothing, outfit or guise. Not surprisingly therefore, we may once again state that the animals of the 'outer focus', including animals drawn in contour, or fully scooped out, are animic depictions. This outer focus is close to the real-life appearance of the animal. We may now add more details, by stating that what these depictions address is not merely a naturalistic appearance; the outer focus is, in fact, a representation of the animal \"by its clothing\". Ingold (2000: 116) has pointed out how animic art generally attributes animal representations in a more genuine way. In this connection, it is interesting to note the aforementioned statements concerning the particularly real and vivid appearance of the (animic) elk depictions of Namforsen. Once and for all, having defined the main feature of animic expression as being 'outer', we are ready to pose the question of whether there might be cases of figural elements appearing within the contour lines that have _nothing to do with inner parts or inner focus_ of the animal. Could there be more figural elements to be defined as 'animic'? Certainly, there could be if these elements represent the animal \"by its guise\". Lines marking the thigh and shoulder (e.g. Rykkje, Vangdal and the Hammaren Phase in Vingen) immediately spring to mind and should be included in the repertoire of animic elements, as these elements belong to the \"outfit\". Along with this, eventual markings of fur and beard belong to the coat of the animal, as these are all elements of the animal's outer appearance. What about human clothing? According to the animic ontology, humans and animals may take on the other party's clothes. In this scenario, it was pointed out how the actual person, although disguised by their clothing, can still be revealed by showing his or her face. This person may be disguised by a hood, but as in the example of the anorak-wearing polar bear, the animal is showing its face, as the hood is pulled down. In images of animals in this state, a pulled-down hood will be marked by a simple line crossing the neck of the figure. Such 'head-lines', as I choose to call them, are not uncommon on big game depictions in our context of rock art. I suggest this to be an animic element. Admittedly, this definition is only based on the evidence given by the concept of animism, and of this one single observation of a native drawing. Yet so far, no explanation for this line exists, let alone any convincing answers as to what this figural element may represent. If this explanation is accepted, we may take this a step further and make other inferences from the markings of elements in human and animal clothes. As obvious from the earlier cited drawing by Alasuaq, the anorak hem is marked by a line crossing through the middle of both the man and the polar bear's bodies. This simple line crossing through the animal's torso, and dividing it in two main parts, is very common in Mesolithic rock art. In Chapter 5, this line was discussed during the examination of natural elements in the rock art-group of eastern Norway. It was concluded that it could probably be included under the few elements that unambiguously could be said to represent a specific natural organ, the so-called midriff muscle. This line also played a part as one of the 'principal lines' of the first stage in a more or less formalized process in the drawing of body fill. Recognizing the issue of animic human-animal \"cross-dressing\", however, creates another possibility as to the origin of this line. Perhaps both explanations are adequate, and probably it adds ambiguity to an element originally evaluated as unambiguously representing a piece of nature. Another unresolved pictorial element would be the lifeline. Gjessing's (1936: 142) thesis connected this element to communication with the animal and defined it to be a device to bring luck in hunting. The lifeline might therefore be placed within the concept of the hunting cycle and to the motemes belonging to it. This would suggest it was an animic element. Anyhow, concerning these lastly discussed \"unresolved\" elements, the most adequate approach when attempting to differentiate them as either animic or tetemic is probably to consider their overall context of depiction. #### Totemism Totemism is most often associated with Australia, whose ethnography is the main source for the understanding and development of the concept. As expressed by Descola (2013: 165-166): \"Nowhere else do we find such a vast gathering of peoples that has so systematically, explicitly and uniformly developed the idea that there exists a moral and physical continuity between groups of humans and groups of non-humans.\" Totemism is also recognized in other continents, and the word root (_-dodem_), from which the concept derives, belongs to the language of the Ojibwa (Hallowell 1960, and see also Ingold 2000: 89-110) of North America. Admittedly this is a group having a typically animic approach to their environment (cf. Descola 2013: 155, 167-169; Ingold 2000: 89-110, 112), and is a fact underlining an earlier confusion around this concept and the demarcation between animism and totemism. This is not the place for a full examination of the history of the tetemic concept. Yet starting this account, which focuses attention on the \"new totemism\", I find it central to point out a basic tenet of its Durkheimian heritage (Durkheim 2001 ). Totemism in this version involves an \"obsession\" with society _as such_; it concerns a special attention to a human group - _of_ their own group, and with this, the communal _bonouring of its symbols_. These features of the theory seem somewhat lost in the more recent advances made in understanding the tetemic concept. The symbols of societal celebration could include what the modern world currently recognizes as pieces of native art. Similar to the Durkheimian theory of totemism, this recent totemic concept rests on Australian ethnography. Another part of the legacy of totemism is that which focuses on categorization of humankind's \"different versions\", expressed by a number of social groups that are signified by way of a special identification with a natural phenomenon (cf. Radcliffe-Brown 1952)."}
{"text": "At the end of Chapter 4, I foreshadowed some examples of what I see to be an essential aspect of this Late Mesolithic analogical logic. A certain amount of the variation created by this logic seems to be steered by a chiasmic structure (cf. Chapters 3 and 4), which, uniquely for this context, could be described as an interplay with visually expressed _inside-outside inversions_. The basic structure, or rather the 'key inversion' of the Late Mesolithic, involves the two following parties: on the one side of the structure is either a herd of big game, or alternatively any version of row-of-humans or herd of deer head poles; on the other side are the design patterns. Explaining why this makes a chiasmic structure demands a brief recapitulation. The key moteme, i.e. the herd of big game, is also a key metaphor that stands in an analogous relationship to the concept of human society; this opposition forms the basic structure of the Late Mesolithic mind's reflection on humanity. Its basic structure is the opposition between thought momenta in which human society, while being \"the same\", is also conceived of as different and separate from the society of the animals. This structure, I contend, has created a special case of a chiasmic dynamic. Thus, when accumulated humans or human-animal hybrids transform into a more or less distinct design pattern and \"move into\" the confinements of the animal bodies, chiasmic relationships might be seen to be between bodies of the _outside_ and (contracted) bodies of the _inside_. In Chapter 4 an example of a chiasmic relationship was placed within a larger geographical perspective, and as such reflects a central difference in Late Mesolithic rock art, i.e. that between Ausevik-Vingen-Alta in opposition to Namforsen. As we recall, in the Noton panel (Namforsen) both humans and elks are depicted as nothing more than plain humans and plain elks (cf. Figure 4.53). The artists creating the elks have had an outer focus on the concept of an elk, but most importantly the two beings - elks and humans - \"stay outside\" of the other party's body. This composition (and similar ones in Namforsen) can be regarded as an inversion - and vice versa - of herds of big game in which the animals have accumulated humans (i.e. humans-in-a-row transformations) incorporating their bodies. Visualizations of such thought structures are, however, also present within one and the same panel, or even within the same composition. A herd of big game in which most animals have body fill is, in fact, in itself the representation of this inversed mirror; in these compositions, despite body fill, the animals _are simultaneously irrefutably_ what they are - elks, deer or reindeer - and consequently in _some sense_ are also communicating their outer appearance. Simultaneously, the 'herd of humans' - linked to the herd of big game as the key metaphor - are making up the insides of the animals. In this way, the inside-outside chiasm structure also resides in one and the same composition. This exemplifies the idea that chiasmic thinking expressed through visual art may exist on several levels. More importantly, the entire body of Late Mesolithic rock art should be regarded as a consummate mirror play, making up an indefinite network of mutual references on different levels, of which several form chiasmic structures (cf. Chapter 4 for more examples). The basic chiasmic structure, as here defined, expresses other creative varieties, for example when design patterns, normally attributed to animal bodies, also adorn bodies of depicted humans. These cases are to be seen as varieties of the basic chiasmic structure which can be described in terms of _outside-inside_ oppositions; it involves a \"movement\" of entities, originally in an outside position - to a position on the inside (of a body). What now \"moves\" inside is the mark, par excellence, of society and culture - indeed designs which originate in contracted and transformed accumulations of human and human-like bodies. As we know, these internal patterns eventually morphed into \"mere patterns\" detached from their bodily context and depicted within a frame, and sometimes even without any line of confinement. Such cases are examples of what could be seen to be a further change, or continuation, of the chiasmic structure; what was normally inside now returns to the outside area. This basic outside-inside structure can then be added with an extra sequence; the outside-inside-(and back)-outside. Alternatively the last two passages, the inside-outside, is just to be regarded an inversion of the \"original\" outside-inside structure. My last hypothesis requires further comment. It appears to be an inaccurate and somewhat indefinite assessment of the state of affairs. Yet what I have tried to reveal is the deep structure of the Late Mesolithic mind. This structure can be translated into a basic formula that paves the way for new paths of knowledge. In my view, there can be no doubt that the visual inversions, deriving from what could be described in terms of outside-inside structures, aid our understanding of the analogical dynamic of the rock art of this specific period. However, we should not forget that this basic formula, despite being an adequate device, still belongs to the realm of theory. The formula is not real in itself; it is real only through its products. Expressed differently, the basic outside-inside structure, or opposition, is _lange_, while the concrete products of rock art represent _parole_. My suggestions concerning alternative twists and turns of this basic formula are just to show the variations of possibilities, and point to the seemingly infinite intellectual creativity of Late Mesolithic people. The chiasmtic structure, however, provides an extended understanding of why animic motemes, to such a great extent, are present in tetemic rock art. However, revealing this phenomenon as a chiasmtic relationship also reveals the relevant dynamics, which in turn serve to explain the strong animic outset of Mesolithic rock art. Simultaneously, it not only explains the tetemic potential, but also how easily a strong tetemic element can disappear. Lastly, I would like to underline that this conclusion is not necessarily a general one, but concerns the expression of animism and totemism in hunters' rock art of Mesolithic and Early Neolithic Scandinavia. Still it is tempting to bring in the conclusion from Willerslev and Ulturgasheva . That animism and totemism are not mutually exclusive is a recurrently stated argument. Despite of this, the authors note that most researchers treat animism and totemism as representing separated realities. In their study of personhood in northeastern Siberia, they conclude that the two \"ontological principles should perhaps better be seen as facets of one and the same mode of being\", and \"that the one cannot really exist without the other\" (Willerslev & Ulturgasheva 2012; 48, 66). This conclusion has great resonance with the present study of animism and totemism in rock art. The final categorization of animic versus tetemic elements is shown in the table in .3. _On a general level, this classification does not capture the solid animic basis of all Scandinavian hunters' rock art_. The most animic element of them all, the key moteme, which is the herd of big game, is not expressed by this formula; the totality of motemes provides a considerably more nuanced basis for explaining animic versus tetemic rock art as it manages to express the strong animic outset. This animic outset tends to disappear when focusing on the tetemic aspect - for instance, when studying a composition of herd of big game in which all animals have body fill."}
{"text": "## Appendix to Chapter 8 On methodology The general discussion on methodology in rock art studies lies beyond the scope of this book.Through the preceding chapters methods have indeed been applied, however, no meta-comments on the use of methods has thus far been given. After having made an attempt to measure totemism, I will shortly remedy this omission and attempt to contextualize my own methods within the discourse of rock art studies. The method of compiling motemes and motemic variation must be seen to be categorized under what Tacon and Chippindale (1998; Chippindale 2001) have classified as a _formal method_ for analyzing rock art. These are methods based on, as the name implies, formal, or systematic compilations of traits and patterns in the empirical base itself. Leroi-Gourhan's (1982, and see Chapter 3) structuralist method for approaching Palaeolithic cave art is, according to Chippindale (2001: 83), the best example of a formal method by its foundation in what he calls \"strong theory\", and involving only the patterns in the figural material. The counting of comparative numbers of animals decorated with body fill is certainly also a formal method, albeit by its simplicity, perhaps only a rudimentary one. In opposition to the formal methods, the _informed methods_ are approaches to rock art through ethnographic and ethno-historical sources. This concept is based on the assumption that recent or present indigenous groups of the area in which the rock art is made are bearers of similar cosmological beliefs as those illustrated in rock art. This approach also includes sources of shamanic experiences and vision quests. The rationale of the informed approach is thus that written sources may \"inform\" about the meaning of rock art compositions in the same area. Obviously, the informed method is not immediately relevant for the rock art in most of our study area, but is a material that demands the use of formal methods, hence \"he importance of formal methods generally increases the further back in prehistory we go\" (Lahelma 2008: 13). As we know, the split between formal and informed approaches is normally not straightforward. Two cases of studying Palaeolithic cave art may, however, illustrate a contrast between formal and informed approaches: Leroi-Gourhan's study of Palaeolithic cave art represents a pure formal and structuralist method, with no use of ethnographic material at all. In contrastto this, Clottes and Lewis-Williams  applied what seems to be a purely informed approach to the same prehistoric context of art by way of what could be seen as an \"interpolation\" of shamanic visionary experiences contained in the San tradition of South Africa (Chippindale 2001: 71-72). Certainly, and given that the informed approach includes any knowledge taken from ethnographic sources, most rock art studies in areas detached from a living tradition apply _some_ aspects of an informed approach. To state that rock art studies draw heavily upon ethnography seems basic, almost trivial. The nearest example of use of ethnography are the applications present in this book; among other ethnographically derived approaches, the concept of the 'hunting cycle' is created on the basis of various sources of hunting agency, mostly from the Northern Hemisphere. There could of course be reasons to question the validity of the hunting cycle, as much as there is a need to have a critical view on the use of ethnographic information generally. Similarly, there are reasons to be critical of the relevance of narratives derived from a living tradition. As demonstrated by Goldhahn's  compelling example, the \"information\" of informed methods is not inevitably reliable. My discussion in Chapter 5, of the use of the neuro-psychological model as a method to understand the origin of design patterns in rock art, could also be read as a critique of an informed approach.  Immediately thus, one should think that the visionary experiences of the trance apply to an insider's perspective, and hence an informed method. Yet, the neuropsychological model, due to its'scientific' status, now falls under the category of formal methods (Whitley 2005: 110-122). The demarcation between formal and informed methods is obviously vague. The fact that an informed approach principally includes all types of ethnographic information makes it problematic to give it a clear definition. Even if we restrict this method to include cosmological _narratives in recent folklore_ only, implying what is arguably close contact in time and space between the makers of the rock art and the holders of given cosmological narratives (see Tacon & Chippindale 1998: 6), a differentiation of the informed approach still cannot be upheld. Lahelma (2008: 145-165; 2012) among other scholars (Helskog 1999; Tilley 1991; Zvelebil & Jordan 1999) has challenged such a strict demarcation by pointing out the relevance of circumpolar cosmology for rock art of the general Nordic area, i.e. countries geographically outside or at the fringes of this tradition. Even more interesting is how Lahelma  has demonstrated the probable relevance of \"information\" contained within the national poem _Kalevala_ to understand not only Finnish rock art, but also elements belonging to the wider Fennoscandian context. Not to be forgotten in this context is Helskog's article _A Study of 3,500 Years of Rock Carvings From Arctic Norway and Their Relationship to the Sami Drums_ , in which he investigates the possibility of an ethno-historical link between imagery in rock art and motifs appearing at the much more recent shamanic drums. To a large degree informed methods represent the quest for what Levi-Strauss would call the narrative code, or simply 'code'. In this work, I have distanced myself from the approach of narratives in rock art compositions, while not rejecting their relevance per se. With reference to earlier discussions (see Chapter 3), I would like to establish that the formal method should not, on a principal level, be seen as the second best alternative for cases in which possibilities for an informed approach is missing. The formal method provides a different type of knowledge. If we imagine a situation where we were able to talk to a Mesolithic person, this person, no matter how strong a ritual specialist, would not have been able to describe motemic variability in Scandinavian rock art. Thus principally, access to informed sources should not rule out the relevance of formal methods. A discussion of the informed and formal perspectives will not be pursued further. The intention of these considerations is merely to place this work's methodical operations within the discourse of formal versus informed methods."}

{"text": "### What is a 'line of contact'?The very premise of this work is meetings. The motemes recorded for the Scandinavian peninsula have been explained as belonging to a common system of references. All motemes are visual references to each other, and reproduced through repetitions, variations and transformations over a common Mesolithic leitmotif. Thus, every moteme forms a reference, or comment, to any other moteme. Ultimately they can be seen as part of a great mirror play. In this work, I have pursued the tenet that this motemic commonality is founded on contact between regions, both near and far. Imbued in this is the assumption that the marked increase in rock art making generally, that is to say, all over the Scandinavian peninsula and beyond, is an integral part of this being an era of increased contact.  While the phenomenon of motemic commonality, in my view, is strong evidence for claiming the existence of a vibrant network on the Scandinavian peninsula, it is accordingly poor in suggesting concrete contact lines. The same goes for another phenomenon of the empirical material, hereafter described as _mixed designs_, i.e. animal figures containing different \"compartments\" of distinctly different formal designs, presumably an expression of the diverse meeting parties' design reproduced within one and the same animal figure. Mixed designs may have served as a special statement of the bonds between the meeting groups.  The phenomenon of mixed design is as intangible as the phenomenon of _blending_ discussed earlier. Such blending would have occurred during hypothetical meetings between eastern Norwegian groups and the groups in Alta. Moreover, and as discussed earlier, the Vingen-Ausevik design par excellence is easy to turn into a more or less standardized vertical line pattern. The distribution of the vertical line pattern could be the strongest evidence of contact between regions, but only on an intuitive level. Due to its commonality it paradoxically cannot be used methodically to infer suggestions about concrete lines of contact. _Similar to the clan landscapes elucidated in the preceding, a map of 'contact lines' must be perceived to present only a fragmented fragment._While the phenomena of \"blending' and'mixing' would have served to blur the traces of contact, the very distinct marks \"left\" upon visiting foreign clan landscapes are a concrete and clear witness to the fact that long-distance contact may have taken place. The mapping of concrete contact lines must, therefore, be based on distinct figural phenomena. _A line of contact_, as defined in this chapter, can be established in cases where such figural phenomena, that are _distinctly typical_ of one clan landscape, are found in another landscape in which it is not common. Thus, I will point out cases where elements that are extremely characteristic of one region appear in a different region, at a considerable distance apart. The type of figural phenomena in question will be discussed for every case described and listed in the following. Generally, however, I want to evade issues related to style, even if this cannot be totally avoided. Whenever pointing out stylistic similarities between depictions located far away from each other, I do not refer to a case of \"close resemblance\"; rather, the mutual similarity is so precise that the one depiction could work as the other's copy. Before presenting the cases a lingering question concerns the nature of contact involved. This will be an issue of its own in Chapter 11. Initially, it can be described as visits and partaking in feasts and rituals and the sealing of the bonds of friendship and alliance through the visiting party being allowed to put its \"stamp\" on the host's rock panels. Alliance involves marriage, and consequently a foreign party moving into the party visited. Thus, some lines must theoretically be seen as more permanent than others, and involving the establishment of kinship ties. Other cases might be a once-in-a-lifetime visit. Both scenarios can be imagined to understand why persons or groups carved their visual imagery and clan landscape mark outside of their area of origin and belonging."}
{"text": "### 370 _Rock art,_ sexe _and the symbolic gift_ At this point, the question is whether the described criteria can be used to come closer to a definition of the Late Mesolithic Nordic version of this man.Is he great or big? On what kind of economic surplus would his gifts be founded? Furthermore, how does this version of informal manly power relate to the position of women? These are the last issues to be discussed. Preceding this, a repetition, or rather a clarification of the premises on which I base my claim, will be explained. In the preceding, I have established that some depictions of human figures in rock art represent great men or big men - in other words, 'aggrandizers', who organized meetings at the large rock art areas. This premise is directly related to the testimony of the cross- and star-shaped hatchets. As pointed out in Chapter 4 (cf. Figure 4.11 and references), there are reasons to believe there was an analogical relationship between big game antlers and parts of this tool category. This link between antler and hatchets, in turn, might be seen to form a reference to men carrying elk antlers and society circles, as represented in rock art. Now, if we accept the tenet that hatchets and axes represent the material imprint of social entrepreneurs, then the appearance of big or great men is archaeologically visible from the Middle Mesolithic onwards. Regarding the long period of use of the hatchets, i.e. their origin in the Middle Mesolithic and continued use throughout the Late Mesolithic, we may assume that the presence of social entrepreneurs in Late Mesolithic societies \"drew upon\" a long tradition. Following up on this as a preliminary conclusion, the Middle Mesolithic could represent a turning point; from this time onwards, coming-up great or big men no longer risked situations where their endeavors of showing off were sanctioned. Another way of putting this is to say that from this point in the social history of the Mesolithic, men were freed from the limitations of potential ridicule. This also seems to be the point of origin of the development of a male dominated society. It corresponds to the process from egalitarianism to institutionalized inequality. Polly Wiessner (2002, and see also R. L. Kelly 2013: 248-268) has discussed this process comprehensively, and although she avoids the term big man, her inquiry demonstrates how the mastering of ritual and warfare, but most importantly the establishing of a position within larger exchange networks is an important prerequisite for the process towards inequality to develop. According to prevalent interpretations, the scenario of men getting increasingly involved with exchange outside their own group has its parallels in the Late Mesolithic to Early Neolithic period in southern Norway. One prerequisite for great and big men societies was, as discussed earlier, population density. Is it at all possible to judge whether the Late Mesolithic figures were more than 7 persons, or 30 persons per square kilometer? Certainly not, even if Bergsvik's (2001: 19) data on settlements by the tidal currents of western Norway indicates a remarkable increase in population density in the Late Mesolithic. Glorstad (2008: 50) has suggested a population number between 20 and 40 persons on the large sites of the 'classic' Nostvet period. Applying this estimation (i.e. 20-40 persons at a site) - andregarding the one site as the only one within a square kilometer - we are way past the critical number of seven persons per square kilometer. Thus, the population estimates suggested for the later part of the Late Mesolithic in eastern Norway support the other evidence of big or great men in our context. Important to note is that population density, as used while discussing Roscoe's table, does not necessarily imply gross measurements of the number of people divided by the area of land available. For comparison purposes, the number of individuals per square kilometer is currently 13.52 for Norway and 21.78 for Sweden.\\({}^{23}\\) If Roscoe's measures are uncritically applied, it would be hard to understand how people on the Scandinavian peninsula ever experienced stratified societies. Densities should be measured with regard to limited regions in which settlements cluster. As described in Chapter 1, a typical trait of the Late Mesolithic is the increasing clustering of sites by tidal currents. These locations were favourable for fishing and created a stable and rich subsistence basis. Taking up farming in these environments was probably not inevitable, since the sea provided a constant source that did not demand the same amount of labour as does the cultivation of land. The significance of a resource base in food supplies was vital as the basis on which to build power and prestige. It is therefore relevant to pose the question of whether Late Mesolithic societies combining the income of the fisheries with the hunting of big game were more on a par with Roscoe's farmers/pig tenders (big man society) than the horticulturalists/hunters (great man society). This remains speculative, and cannot get us much closer to a conclusion. Yet, my belief is that the Late Mesolithic elk-men were great rather than big. A large surplus of fish or not - I believe the essential economic base of their power is to be found in a resource that was not only periodic, but also fundamental to the arranging of a great meeting: _the big animals gained during seasonal mass hunting by Alta, Namforsen and Vingen_. This is a cyclical and unstable resource and probably not a sufficiently fruitful ground for big man-ship proper to grow. How, then, is this Late Mesolithic great man scenario \"aligned\" with our earlier conclusion - i.e. a scenario suggesting Schmidt's  'low gender intensity?' The extremely low percentage of sexual markers on depicted humans may, in fact, be regarded as an outcome of this low gender intensity. Thus, hunting could be an activity of women, and judging from the evidence of rock art, women probably took part in communal cuts celebrating the great elk, or elk-man. The gathered evidence concerning the situation of women discussed in this chapter better suits the great man than the big man phenomenon. Important to remember still is that both social forms involve men's exchange of sisters. But as Godelier (1986: 27, 29-30, 63-66) reports, women in great man societies are not at all bereft of power, and they potentially have some say in their marriage arrangements. Yet, as is evident from Maria Lepowsky's  study of the people of Sudest Island (Vanatanai) of the Louisiade Archipelago, the notion that the building of this type of power always applies to men could be challenged. In fact, among the egalitarian people of Vanatanai there are as many big women as there are big men."}
{"text": "### 3.2 Rock art, Sever and the symbolic gift Dan Jorgensen  has discussed the relationship between the sexes and compared the input in labour in great man versus big man societies.It would seem that in the latter social form female labour is the very foundation of male power and prestige. Thus, the wives of big men are producers of the food surplus required to build this power and prestige by their husbands (cf. Strathern 1988). In great men societies, this \"use\" of female labour is not present. Another important feature of the difference between the two concerns the logic of exchange. Among great men, a \"woman is exchanged for another woman\" (Godelier 1986: 23, 28-30; 1991: 277) - i.e. the dominating exchange form is like for like. Among big men, on the other hand, the objects of exchange can be converted into other objects of wealth. Yet another difference between the two is that the latter system involves big men's public displays of power and prestige. Still, both social forms involve the presence of strict male spheres; great men societies involve the construction of these spheres, but instead of building their prestige on the products of female labour, they work for themselves and are more directed towards the cultivating of a manly separate domain, away from the public realm. Turning to the situation in Late Mesolithic northern Europe, the situation was probably that women took part in communal rituals celebrating big game. Simultaneously we may think that great men, through ritual, \"worked\" to make big game hunting an exclusively male activity. Another sphere of male control was probably stone tool production and raw material procurement. A. B. Olsen and Alsaker's  results from investigations of the two large quarries in western Norway (cf. Figure 7.6) demonstrate that the volume of rock extracted increases during the Mesolithic and reaches a peak in its later phases. Of specific interest here, however, is the characteristics of the procurement and production process; not only does it intensify, but studies of the masses of debris and prefabricated material at the quarry and at nearby workshop sites imply that the persons who were manufacturing tools at these locations came back to the settlements with almost ready-made tools. Thus, it would seem that procurement and production of adzes took place in a secluded context by the quarry. The fact that only men are buried with stone axes in south Scandinavian Late Mesolithic graves may lend evidence to claim that what we witness here is the existence of a male sphere - a secret or esoteric realm. The analogy to a male sphere of initiationrites (cf. Barth 1987; Hampton 1999) is tempting. Until now, no attention has been given to men who were not among the great ones. They are surely present, and they might be represented by the simplest elk's head dress in rock art, or their existence is present as males in graves lacking axes. These other men might be younger males, who followed great men in hunting, initiation rituals and secret enterprises. On the ground of the discussion offered, and as suggested by the title of this section, I suggest that the sex concept of the Late Mesolithic includes the following: \"free\" or, rather 'independent women' as well as 'great men'. One could probably add 'other men' as well."}
{"text": "Southerly contacts are recorded in the Alta rock art, but there is also a strong connection from this area to Namforsen. Further on, in the succeeding sub phase of the Early Neolithic a clear change in style takes place in Alta as it becomes fully animic, while rock art making in the south terminates. The similarities between the Alta and Namforsen rock art suggest a consolidation and continuation of a contact line well established in the Late Mesolithic. This Alta-Namforsen axis of \"animism regained\" should be seen as being linked with the eastern and northern parts of Fennoscandia and northwestern Russia. I have suggested that the start of early farming in the south simultaneously marks the emergence of a differentiated circumpolar culture in the north. Thence, peoples of this circumpolar area are the bearers of an animic ethos still vivid in the northernmost parts of the Northern Hemisphere."}
