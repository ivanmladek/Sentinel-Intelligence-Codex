## Introduction

The MIG-17 Fresco followed the MIG-15 Fagot into Soviet Air Force service and evolved into a highly maneuverable, reliable and easy to maintain air combat fighter. The Fresco was one of the most widely reported fighters of all time and saw service in Europe, the Middle East, Africa and Asia, seeing combat in a number of conflicts. During the Vietnam war, the MIG-17F was expected by U.S. pilots flying faster, heavier aircraft of a new generation. They quickly found out that the extremely maneuverable, commonarmed Fresco C was a formidable opponent in air-to-air combat. Based on reports of air engagnements over Vietnam, the MIG-17J had an influence on future American fighter designs. The cannramed or the MIG-17J proved that gun armament for fighters was far from obsolete, a lesson fighter pilots brought home for Vietnam and impressed on the designers of the next generation of U. S. combat aircraft (the F-14, F-15 and F-16 all have cannaman arrangement).

Even forty years after its maidaid flight, the MIG-17 Isstill in operational service with a number of air forces around the world -- propt that the Fresco is a reliable and sound design.

During the late 1940s, the Cold War between the Free World and the Soviet Union escalated. In 1948 the Soviet Union stopped the supply of material to Berlin through the Soviet Sector of Germany. Thanks to the Berlin Airlift, Staff Staff is to drive the Western spores out of Berlin was unsuccessful. The situation continued to worsen when the USSR and China signed a Friendship and Cooperation Paci in February of 1950.

During this period, the Soviet Union made great strides in developing new combat aircraft which were equal in performance to those built in the West. These included the Mid-5, which few for the first time in December of 1947 and was cleared for mass protection as a year later.

Operational trials with the MIG-15 revealed that the aircraft had a number of shortcomings, especially in its handling characteristics in high speed flight. These concerns were carefully analyzed by the MIG-OKB, but by this time MIG-15 production was well established and, in order to build as many new fighters as possible, the production line was not interrupted to introduce the modifications needed to solve the handling problems encountered during high mach number flights.

The most severe problems centered around the aircraft's handling and included: loss of directional control at high Mach numbers, poor lateral directional stability at high altitudes, a low roll rate and poor control responses at high indicated airspeeds. Another problem cared around the rather ineffective speed brakes and poor wheel brakes. The aircraft also had a tendency to stall easily with unpredictable control responses to the stall (direction of stall turn depended on speed and attitude). This problem was considered extremely serious, since it resulted in temporary loss of control and could be disastrous if it occurred at low altitudes.

## 2 MIG-15LL (Project SE)

During 1949, the first trials aimed at breaking the sound barrier with the MIG-15 took place. According to Soviet operational manuals, the top speed of the MIG-15bis was limited to MIG 092. A design team under the lead of I.M. Pashkowskij and M.I. Masurski began a program to modify the MIG-15bis to reach Mach 1.

A standard production MIG-15bis was taken off the production line and specially converted for the high speed trials. This aircraft received the MIG-OKB project code of "SE" and the public designation MIG-15LL (_Laguishtaba Laboratoria_ - Flying Laboratory). It differed from the standard MIG-15bis in having an enlarged tail section. For the trials the armament was retained.

During the first flight, held on 21 September 1949, test pilot Anatolij M. Tyutarev achieved a speed of Mach 0.97 during a shallow angle drove from 12,000 meters (39,370 feet). Three days later, he achieved Mach 0.985. It became clear that the aircraft would not be able to reach Mach 1 due to its tendency to roll to the left, which could only be avoided by using all the physical strength the pilot had. The MIG-15LL was returned for further modification and the tail section was enlarged further and a BU-10-10 hydraulic boost rudder system was installed. After a month of modification work, the aircraft was again ready for a test flight.

On 18 October 1949, Anatolij M. Tyutarev proved from 12,200 meters (40,000 feet) and achieved Mach 1.01 (this was only the second time that a Soviet aircraft had flow faster than the speed of the sound). The trials with the MIG-15LL provided the MIG-OKB with valuable research data, as a result of the experience gained with the BU-10 hybridraulic boost system, it was introduced into the MIG-15bis production line (beginning in 1950). Three years on two different MIG-15LR built and it served as a test bed for various programs until it was finally destroyed in a crash.

During 1949, the MIG-OKB began on a successor to the MIG-15 with the aim of correcting all the shortcomings of the Fayet but without changing its high rate of climb, rapid acceleration, short turning radius and short taxeloff and landing characteristics. The MIG-OKB's internal designation for the new fighter type was Project SI and the Soviet military assigned the designation I-330 (I for _hyperbolic_ - Fighter) to the new type.

The prototypes were conversions of MIG-15 airframes that had been retained at the Experimental Bureau for testing. The first prototype was fitted with an entirely new wing and designated the SI-11-Nuss followed short time later by the second prototype, the SI-2 Basically, the prototypes were MIG-15bis airframes fitted with a redesigned wing, an increased fuselge length and an enlarged vertical fin. Both prototypes were completed during December of 1949, with the S1-2 being retained as a test test platforms, while the SI-2 was used for the flight tests. The SI-1 was also taken to the full scale wind tunnel at the Central Area-Hydrodynamics Institute (TSA0) for investigation of the airflow over the new wing.

One of the main differences between the MIG-15 and the Project SI prototypes was the new wing had a inboard leading edge sweep of 49 degrees and an outboard The S8-2 was the MIG-17 prototype used for the flight tests and five for the first time on 1 February 1956 with _washessweep of 45.5 degrees. The entire wing was much thinner than the Mid-15 wing and had more rounded wing tips. In order to avoid loss of airflow over the wing at two speeds, the wing was equipped with three wing fences instead of the two used on the Mid-15 wing. This new wing gave the SI prototype improved transonic behavior and better compressibility characteristics. The two different leading edge sweep angles resulted in a bend in the middle of the wing leading edge which led to its nickname of "Sickle" wing.

The fuselage was lengthened by 1.126 meter (3.98 feet) improving the prototypes lateral stability, while the increased tail surfaces improved directional stability and control. Another improvement was the installation of more effective wheeled brakes on the main wheels, while the nonsechieved had no brakes. The main wheel covered were also slightly modified in shape and the inod main wheel doors were reduced in area and reshaped. On the Mid-15, the doors were squared off, while on the SI prototypes the doors had a triangular shape.

The SI-2 prototype carried a radio antenna fairing on top of the fuselage and an armant of two NS-23 cmumons and a single NS-37 cmumon. On I February 1950, the SI-2 made its maiden flight from Zhukovsky with MiG test pilot ban Timofeyevich washesch at the controls. During the flight testing conducted over the following weeks, the SI-2 achieved a speed in levelflight of 692 mph at 7.058 feet and a speed of 176 mph during a shallow confecury. During the trials, the prototype reached an altitude of 16,600 meters(45.446 feet) and consistently repeated far better handling qualities at high mean numbers than the MiG-15.

The project suffered a serious setback when the SI-2 prototype crashed on 20 March 1950. Ivan T. Ivashchenko had been briefed to dive from 16,042 feet and for some unknown reason he failed to recover from the drive. The SI-2 hit the ground at full speed, killing the pilot and totally destroying the prototype. During later tests with the SI-20 (the third prototype), G. Sedov discovered that the aircraft suffered from alieron flutter caused by a phenomenon known as aerolastic divergence. This was caused by a lack of wing rigidity which caused the alertos to impart a rolling control movement, exactly opposite of what the pilot intended.

The SI-02, Red 671, was the third prototype, while the SI-01 was actually the fourth prototype delivered at Zhukovsky (due to production problems). Both were converted into MiG-15bis afframes which differed in minor details from the earlier SI-2. Instead of a radio antenna fairing on the upper fuselage, these prototypes carried an SRU-01 IF side antenna. The SI-02 also had the radio antenna were detected. The SI-02 had nearly MidG-15 style nosewell and was armed with a pair of NS-23 cmumons and a single NS-37 cmumons. The SI-01 was similar to the SI-02 but had a trim tth bitted to the radar and provision for a 400 filter (105.6610) slipper state. Both prototypes were equipped with the RISU-3 "Klein", radio, SBU-1/IF system, OS-15 DS system, ADK-5 radio compass and a MRP-48 marker beacon receiver. The SI-02 was powered by the same engine as the MIG-15bis. The 5528 TW-1 turboit (without afterburner).

The State Acceptance Test Program was conducted by G. Sedov, S. Anochin, K. Kokkinski and P. Kazimi. During these trials, speeds of 1,152 kmph/Mach 103) were achieved. The best program was successfully completed on 20 June 1951 and in August of that same year, the aircraft was ordered into mass production under the designation MIG-17.

The test results clearly showed the advantages of the MiG-17 as compared with the MiG-15bis: it was 25 mph to 31 mph faster with better flying characteristics at high mach numbers and it had an improved rate of climb. The only shortcomings were more demanding handling characteristics during takeoff and landing because of the new, more sharply swept wing and an increased takeoff weight (some 600 pounds more than the MiG-15bis).

## 4 MiG-17 Fresco A

The first production batch of MiG-17s began leaving the factory during August of 1951, and were assigned to combat units for operational testing during October of that same year.

Early production MGG-17s were used primarily as air superiority day fighters and recent efforts. Compared to the MGG-15, there was very little change in the asterarity overall handling characteristics except for the greatly improved IMF characteristics at which high mach numbers and the slightly more demanding taxoff and landing characteristic because of the modified ship. It was not uncommon for experienced pilots to complete transition training from the MGG-15 to the MGG-17 in only few weeks.

The production MGG-17 differed from the prototypes a nominal number of ways. It should be remembered that the SI prototypes were in fact converted with:31-bisu airframes with the new wings and vertical fit. As such, they all retained a number of features from the MGG-15.

While the SI-BSI-BSI had large fings on the NS-23 cannon with air/shell ejection ports, the MiG-17 had the short IN-23 cannon fairings and fared shell ejection ports. Both prototypes used the early style MGG-15 newcomed, while the production MGG-17 used the later style MGG-15bsuosed. The SI-BSI had a single pit on the networked wing near that last wing fence, while the MGG-17 had two pit tubes, one on each wing near the wing. The air brake on the production MGG-17 was generated and repositioned over the rear fuselage and equipped with a fairing over the hydraulic actuator.

The internal fuel capacity of the MGG-17 was 379 gallos carried in a rubberized main fuel tank mounted above and below the wing center section and in a second aluminum fuel tank containing 32 gallos mounted under the engine exhaust pipe. In addition, SSII found another-wise fast calls could be also carried.

During 1946, the Klimov-OKB began first studies aimed at improving the performance of a Polish for Koles Royce some power plant. This program resulted in the Yk-powered plant (the designation UK was given in honor of the chief designer Vladimir Klimov). The engine was essentially an improved Nue that could handle 30% greater airflow, which substantially increased the engine's available thrust. Other changes included enlarged combustion chambers, turbine blades and PIP, the Klimov-OKB succeeded making the improvements without enlarging the overall diameter of the engine. The MGG-17 was powered by a slightly improved variant of the VK-1, the 5.952 NUE MGG-17 was unveiled to the public on 20 June 1953 during the Air Paradox at Teshing Air Force Base, which was attached by a number of Western military attached. Initially it was speculated that the designation of the new type was the MGG-15-3 since no details of the types designation had been released by the Soviets and many Western observes blocked that it was a new variant of the MGG-15.

Before NATO was established, the USAF had established a system of identification numbers for new Soviet aircraft. This system allocated each new tape a number in straight numerical sequence the system did not distinguish the different categories of aircraft. The type number catalogues system was used for the first time at the Teshino Air Pardo on 18 August 1946. Atthis show, Western observers spotted too new jet fighter aircraft. The Ska-15 which became "Type I" and the MGG-9 which became the "Type 2". Under this system, the MGG-15 was known as the "Type 14" and the MGG-15bisu swing the "Type 19". When it was first identified, the MGG-17 received the designation "Type 38".

When NATO was formed during 1955, a new system came into being thataused names instead of "Type" numbers. The Air Standards Coordinating Committee (ASCC) assigned names to each new aircraft according to the aircraft's mission, with all fighter types receiving names beginning with F. Under this system the early production MGG-17 received the ASCC Reporting Name, Fresco A. In mid-1955, the USAF began to drop the Type number system in favor of the NATO Reporting Name system.

The maximum fraction of the MGG-17 Fresco A was assuest one in the late MGG-15bis. A set of 3770 March one was carried on the starboard side of the retractable weapons platform, with two NR-23 23rd Manu cannos placed on the port side. Maintenance and rearming of the MGG-17 was simple and easy to accomplish. The cannon barrel covers were removed and the retractable weapons platform was lowered on its wire supports (with the help of a hand held which). In the lowered position the ammunation boxes could be easily reloaded and the guns themselves could easily be removed, serviced or inspected.

The combination of two 23rd Manu cannon and a single 73rd Manu weapon gave the MGG-17 formidable firepower against ground targets and for bomber interception, but the low jet offer those large earlier weapons was at disadvantage in air-to-air fighter combat. The large cabinet weapons used by the Soviet Union during this period had been developed by the Ruessians after GreatPariticWar (WWII) and were based on German designs, in particular those of the Rheineml company.

The Nue-23 cannon had been developed from the NS-23, which was carried on the MGG-18bisu was mass produced from 1999 onwards and featured and improved an involution system and improved an antecedent due of the new ingenstead in 1950 on first the NS-23. The N-37 cannon weighed 103 (ks 227 pounds) and had at nice of fire of 400 rpm. The ammunation supply for the N-37 was forty rounds which the NR-23 had eighty rounds per gun stored in ammunation boxes between the gun barrels.

The MGG-17 could carry under-wing weapons on a DA-50 bomb track which was mounted in place of the usual under-wing fuel tanks. This track could carry various types of bombs including 100, 220 and 551 pound weapons. The under-wing pylo could alsocarry two 212MM ARS-212 or four 190MM TRS-190 unguided rockets. The TRS-190 weighted 46 kg(100 pounds) with a 10 kg(22 round) warhead, while the ARS-212 weighed 11 kg(226 pounds) with a blast radius of 22 feet. The TRS-190 and ARS-212 could be fired singly or in silows.

Additionally, the MiG-17's could carry the ORO-57K seven hot rocket pod armed with 55:578 muon SPOCK products. There were two different types of 58:58-58-58-58 MM for air-to-air engrantions and the 58:58 for air-to-ground attacks. Carrying either the TRS-190, ARS-212 or ORO-57K pod reduced the top speed of the MiG-17 by 20 km (121 kg) and the service ceiling by 680 m (121 kg).

Avionics installed in the MiG-17 included an ARS-5 "Amm" radio compass, an RV-2" "Kristal" radio altimeter ("T" shaped antennas carried under the port withpiapp and starboard wind gap), an MRP-58" "Krizarian marker beacon receiver, and MOO-3MIS reflection filter, and an RR-800 radio (the transition and receiver were carried in the nose compartment in front of the cockpit).

The MiG-17 used the same silicon set as the MiG-15 and MiG-15bis. This set was a rather primitive design that assured a safe election and it speeds for 70 km/hour (435 mg) and at altitudes above 750 feet (below 70 feet the parachuate would not fully deploy). This type of seed had several shortcomings, it was difficult to reject the air-erfan since the MiG had to be in horizontal flight, there was no protection for the pilots face and be had to be in average himself from the seat if 1.5 to 2 seconds and manually open his parachute, there was no automated artefact release and there was no chance for survival if the pilot lost consciousness since there was no system for automatically opening the parachute.

While the MiG-17 prototypes (except SI-01) had no trim tub on the rudder, the production MiG-17 Fresco A had a small trim tub added to the rudder. To improve directional stability, the MiG-17 had a ventral fin installed under the rear breakage. This fin also incorporated a tail bumper in the rear portion of the fin.

The MiG-17 wing was thinner than the MiG-15 wing and, while the MiG-15bis had two wing fines with a custom in the aboard porti wing fence, the MiG-17 had three wing fences with nocutouts. The three wing fines were installed to prevent spun-wise air flow at it high angles of attack. The wing structural elements were similar to the MiG-15-but the leading edge had a bend at mid-span. The inboard sweep angle was 49 degrees while the outboard angle was 45 degrees. The aluminum air enters power boosted by a BU-1U hydraulic boost system and were fitted with trim controls. The wing was also fitted with Fowler type trailing edge flaps that extended 20 degrees for takeoff and 60 degrees for landing.

While early production Fresco Aslacked radar warning antennas, later Fresco As had two antennas on each wing. These small button antennas were located beside the outdoor wing fence and behind the wing position light. Additionally, the MiG-17 had a small rectangular balance weight installed under each wing.

One complaint voiced by pilots involved in the operational testing of the MiG-17 concerned the rather ineffective main wheel brakes. As a result, the main landing gear was fitted with improved pneumatic brakes which became standard on production of MiG-17s.

Early MG-17s were not fitted with the Syrena 2 tail warning radar, which was added to the nation's head after the first production batches left the assembly line. The Syrena 2 tail warning radar system was installed in a faining just below the tail position light.

The first MiG-17 Fresco As off the production line were equipped with the same canopy as the MiG-15bis. As shortrate later, a new canopy was introduced into the production line that was similar to the MiG-15bis canopy but had a smaller rear canopy frame and a rear view mirror installed in the upper canopy framing. Most MG-17 Fresco As were equipped with a liquid closing system. This system used alcohol sprayed onto the windscreen from a small tube mounted in front of the windscreen.

There were a number of early MG-17s fitted with the SRU-17F blade antenna on the fuselage, sipine, although most Fresco Asd did notcarry ustimla antenna. A fewer MiG-17s also used a radio antenna system similar to the MiG-15 where the antenna wire area from the tail to a small post just below the large swept back antenna mast however, this system was quickly deleted and most Fresco As carried no antenna wire.
Later, some MIG-17 Fresco As were modified with under-wing rocket/missile rails. These rails could carry either large air-to-ground rockers or K-13AA (AA-2)Atoll air-to-air infrared guided mislises. An improved variant of the MIG-17 Fresco A with a VK-1A power plant and improved vorios and cockpit equipment was produced under the designation MIG-17SA. Externally it was identical to the Fresco As so it received no new NATO name.

There were only the WARSWAP Pacut countries that operated the MIG-17 Fresco A. Bulgarian was the first country to be equipped with the Fresco A receiving flight first air-art during 1953. These aircraft served with the 10th Fighter Division and late in their operational service lives were randomized for use in the fighter-buncher role.

In these 1958, Poland received a small number of Fresco As. In 1957 the German Democratic Republic also received a few Fresco As, which were generally referred to as the MIG-17-year (_gain_ -- thanks). This came came about from the fact that the aircraft lacked a sub-designation letter. Most of the Fresco As were assigned to the School Regiment of the Offers School. They were also used as trainers with the fighter regiments of the East German Air Force.

When later variants of the MIG-17 became available, a number of MIG-17 Fresco As were exported. During 1957, the first MIG-17 Fresco As were delivered to Afghanistan: these aircraft were later supplemented by a number of MIG-17/S. Most of the MIG-17 force was based at Mazari-i-Sharif Air Force Base and when the Soviet Union came in to help the Afghan government. Afghan Air Force MIG-17 Fresco As were used to fly ground attacks against the Mujahideen. These stories were carried out using cannon fire, unguided rockets and bombs.

MIG-17 Fresco As were also delivered to the air forces of China, Cuba, Morocco, Mongolia, Mozambique and Sri-Lankar (Cejston).

During the Soviet/WARSW Pacut invasion of Czechovskia in 1968, a number of Soviet Air Force Fresco As were deployed to provisional airfields inside Czechovskia.

The first of these aircraft were deployed during August and all the aircraft which took part in the invasion were marked with two large Red stripes around the rear fuselage to allow for rapid identification of friendly aircraft.

The Fresco A MAG-17, MIG-17 and MIG-17SA was considered to an interim aircraft by the Soviet Air Force. Work was progressing on a new variant of the VK-1 engine with an afterburner. After this engine, designated the VK-1F, passed state acceptance trials and was cleared for mass production, work began on a new variant of the MIG-17 designed to use this engine. Production of the Fresco As located from August of 1955 until the Spring of 1953 when the production was phased out in favor of this new afterburner equipped variant.

As the Fresco A was replaced by more advanced variants, many were passed to training regiments while others were retained for conversion training within combat units and remained in service for a very long period.

The SR-2 left the factory during May of 1952 and flew for the first time from Zhukovsky with MG-ORB test pilot (A. Tsynchrouvuvato the controls during June. The factory tests lasted from June of 1952 until January of 1954. During this same period the State Acceptance trials were held in parallel and involved LIT pilots by Mikrojan and P. Bobysani. The State acceptance trials lasted until 10 August 1954. While the SR-2 met the Air Force specification, the use of the VR-5F power plant was felt to be impractical since all other late production MG-7s were equipped with the VR-1F power plant. As a result, the project was abandoned and the SR-2 prototype remained a one of a kind prototype.

## 4 MiG-17SN (Project SN)

One of the most interesting experimental trials were carried out by the MGG-OKB was known as Project SN. The entire project was based on the theory that the use of flexible cannons on a single seather failure as an effective way to quickly bring your own ownQs to bear enemy aircraft. It was felt that the advantage of the flexible guns was hand only the gun, not the entire aircraft had to be aimed at the target.

The project involved the MGG-OKB and the cannon's manufacturer. Afanasmeyer and Makarov. They were responsible for the articulated cannon system which was to be installed in the fliper. The Project SN prototype was a standard MG-17 Frecon Awith as completely redesigned nose section that was 1.069 meters longer (3.65). To mount the gun turret, the nose air intake was deleted and the aircraft was fitted with bifurcated fusclage sof mounted at intakes.

The VR-52-MGG-17-armed stream installed in the MGG-17-bus consisted of the TRA-952-ISM cannons installed in the nose, two on the ports and one on the board side. The guns were able to quickly through an arc of 2-7 degrees 25- and 3-6 degrees 47-She. These were electrically small, hard, and a rate of the 1250 pounds per unit of and the entire system weighed edge 469 (2.03 0 pounds).

The factory steps began 1953, UART period G. Mosolov. The State tests, conducted by the Flight Research Institute, started on 15 February 1954. The SV-23-MG-17 armed stream was also installed on an i2-N Beagle bomber train pilots in the US of the turret. There were only three test flights made with the MGG-17 Frecon Awith as air firring, while another thirteen flights were executed against ground targets.

**Project SB-2 was intended to be able atbo reconnaissance warrant of the MG-17 Freco Awith. A. The prototype was tested at Zhukovsky during 1952. In place of the normal switch WR-23-camons, the prototype carried a single 2-A camon on the spot side of the nose housed in a single long and a filter under the Rosago to accommodate the camera system. It was powered by a VR-5F power plant and had a ceiling of 85,000 feet.**

The tests with the MGG-175N once again showed that theory and practice could differ sharply from each other. The flight tests revealed that there was great difficulty in accurately aiming articulated weapons from high speed aircraft. One of the aiming problems was that angles of \(+\) 10 degrees required a special gangship. The trials also revealed that the MGG-175N was about 60 kmh (37 mph) slower than a standard Fresco A.

Due to the serious aiming difficulties and the inferior performance of the prototype, the project was abandoned.

## 5 I-340 (Project SM-1)

During the late 1940s and early 1950s the MGG-OKB worked on several designs aimed at producing a superposition fighter which could be mass produced. The MGG-15L- and MGG-175N were capable Madu I, but only brief periods in a drive. During the past two phases began to develop a win designed supersonic experimental aircraft based of the MGG-17 under the designation I-340 (also known as the SM-1) was the beginning of an experimental program that later evolved into the MGG-19.

The I-340 was fitted with two 6,02 lost AM-5F power plants developed by Alexander Rifkin. The advantages of these engines were either small diameter and their excellent test consumption. The power plants were installed side by side in a redesigned rear fusclage which also housed two additional fuel tanks (220 and 330 lines respectively 58 and 87 gallos).

The factory steps began during late 1955. These trials were flow flow flow. MGG-188 pilot Grig
The Project SN prototype was a lighter-asasasit aircraft based on the MO-17 Fasco A. The aircraft had a new nose section equipped with three (2) articulated TRT-495 234 canon and bifurcated side mounted at intakes. The guns could be rotated vertically +27 degrees (upper) and -6 degrees (lower). The gun lifts were equipped with adding seals that served for their then in and reduce drag.

Project SN Prototype

The twin engined SM-1 was tested at Zukowsky during 1981. The diameter of the rear fuselose was enlarged to accommodate the two, 0.720 IRM-48-F power plants. The aircraft also carried to Syrian a rail swimming radar antenna. Experience against with this aircraft was highly useful during development of the MO-18.

Mig-17F Fresco C

The MIG-17F (F for _Forsironumpy_ - boosted) was the most widely produced variant of the MIG-17. The main difference between the MIG-17F and the earlier MIG-17 Fresco A was the power plant. The MIG-17F used the 74521bst RV-1F afterburning turboet. The introduction of the afterburner gave the MIG-17F a substantial increase in available power for taskoff and combat; however, fuel consumption was drastically increased and, as a result, the MIG-17F was usually flown with two 400 filter (105.6 gallon) understrop d tanks.

The Vk-IF power plant was based on the Vk-14 hour was radically redesigned by Vladimir Y. Kilmow and his staff in the Kilmow-OKB in Leningrad and it became at the first mass produced Soviet jet power plant with an afterburner. Compared with the Vk-1A used in the MIG-15bis and MIG-17A, the thrust of the Vk-IF was greatly improved, from 5.908 lbst to 7452 lbst while engine negitchvined is a torad of 263 pounds. Static tests of the new power plant were successfully completed during 1952 and later later same year the Vk-IF was cleared for installation into a MIG-17 for flight testing. Airframe modification work to accommodate the new afterburning engine was done under the MIG-OKB project code SF.

The SF prototype was a converted MIG-15bis. It had the early MIG-15bis type nooswell, was arrived with two NS-23 amounds and a single NS-37 amound and used as standard MIG-15bis campos. Compared with the standard Frees A, the SF prototype featured a totally redesigned rear Taskage. The air brakes were enlarged and reshaped with the hydraulic jet having tension positioned higher on the air brake.

The factory test program began on 29 September 1951 and quickly revealed the prototype's improved performance, stability and handling at ramuscone speeds. On 1 february 1952, the SF prototype was handled over the Flight Research Institute (LTI) for further testing. The LTI tests revealed that the prototype had a greatly improved rate of climbs. While the Frees A required minutes six seconds to reach 328.68 lf, the SF reached this same altitude in three minutes forty-two seconds. The service ceiling was also increased from 50.049 get on the MIG-17 Fresco A to 53.286 lf, however, the top speed actually decreased slightly from 746 mph for the MIG-175 mph for the SF prototype.

The tests proved very successful and were terminated during late 1952. The aircraft was ordered into production under the designation MIG-17F and when identified. NATO allocated the MIG-17F the ASS reporting name Fresco C. In Czechoslovakia the aircraft was known under the designation S-104 (which was later changed to MIG-17 during the late 1950s). In Hungary the MIG-17 was called the _Cznso_ (Gilder).

The MIG-17F Fresco C differed from the MIG-17F Fresco A in a number of ways. Exterally, the most noticeable change was the redesigned tail section. On the Fresco A the jet pipe was not visible and there was no small access hatch at base of the rudder. Additionally, a number of access hatches around the fin and rear fuselage were reduced because of the new engine. The MIG-17F also had four small air links on the fuselage at side and a small access hatch was added to the nose on the port side.

Another difference between the MIG-17 Fresco A and MIG-17F Fresco C was the location of the EKS-46 flare dispersive. This signal flare haunber, which could fire up to four different color flares, was relocated from the starboard fuselage on the Fresco A. On the Fresco C was relocated to a position on the lower part of the fin. While early production Fresco A were not equipped with a Syrena, fail warning radar, all Fresco Cs carried the system on the fin below the position light.

The MIG-17 SF prototype had a redesigned rear fuselage for the afterburning engine with enlarged at brakes. If old two have a trim tab on the rudder or a Syrena 24 leaf warning radar. The SF prototype was test flown by PyP Karamin who achieved a speed of MIG-1.6 in a five month 14,000 meters (46,000 feet).

There are also some improvements made in the cockpit layout and equipment. While all Fresco A were equipped with a MIG-15p geo station, the Fresco C was fitted with an improved ejection set. This seat differed from the early seat in having a much larger headtest that was more box shaped than that of the Fresco A. The seat headtest included a face curtain that was pushed down in front of the piplot facts for both hands. This action fired the canopy and, when the curtain was fully deployed, actuated the seat charge.

Three seconds after ejection, the AD-3 seat belt cutter automatically separated the pilot from the seat. If the pilot failed to manually open his parcainte, it was automatically opened between 15,000 and 12,000 feet. The new seat allowed safe selections of speed up 850 lbst (825 mph).

The Vk-IF had a number of advantages over the earlier Vk-IA in operational service. Thanks to the afterburner, the takeoff run was reduced from 590 meters (1,198 lfect). There were, however, some limitations to afterburner use. One shortcoming was that the afterburner could only operate for three minutes at altitudes below 7,000 meters (2296 feet) and for ten minutes at altitudes above 10,000 meters (229680 feet). If these were succeeded, there was a risk of fire in the engine. On later production batches, this problem was resolved.

One of the shortcomings of the MIG-17F was its increased fuel consumption in afterburner. Due to several internal changes, the fuel capacity of the MIG-17F was reduced from 379 gallons (fresco A to 37 gallon) to 37 gallon. As result, the MIG-17 was usually flown with two 400 filter (105.6 gallon) underwing fuel tanks. The maximum economical endurance with external fuel tanks is two hours thirty-nine minutes at 12,000 meters (39,370 feet).

**Figure 18 with the SF prototype began on 29 September 1951. While undergoing State Acceptance Testing the aircraft carried the badge of the LTI (Puff Research Institute) on the nose in Red and Soviet national insignia on the fuselage as well as the fin.**

The MGi-17F has seen combat in a number of local and regional conflicts around world. It was introduced into combat during the 1956 Arab-Jiasr water, the first MGi-17F has been delivered to Egypt shortly before the start of hostillities. In March of 1963, the MGi-17 saw combat with the North Yemen Air Force against Royal Air Force Huntes in South Femen. In August of that same year, Israeli Mirae IIICJ fisheries were pagued by Syrian Air Force MGi-17F.

The rocker trials can held held four "Total Sakr" unpaided rocks. The Defects were built and the MGi-17F conversion work was done at the Helena Aircraft Modification Depot. MGi-17F have been active in every Arab/Jensried war, including the 1973 war war wide-MGi-17F's saw combat with the both the Egyptian and Syrian Air Forces.

There were also a number of lesser known conflicts where the MGi-17F saw combat. The lighter Buffar Air in Nigeria between 1968 and 1970, Federal Nigerian Air Force MGi-17F's conducted ground support and attack missions was given. The Fresco C also saw action during the border and have been vigorously and has 1972 and in Mozambique ex-worth Korean Air Force Force Cs for missions against local relebd forces. In Afghanistan, MGi-17F's few alongside the MGi-17F's exceed a delivered earlier, in ground attack missions against relebd methods in the mountains.

The MGi-17F's own combat against Americans forces in Southeast Asia. The Fresco C was first fighter introduced into the North Vietnamese Air Force. The NVAF received its first MIG-17F on August 1964. These aircraft were suppliedly China and are actually Chastikh-15-80. The 1973 Widers 5, MGi-17F became the first North Vietnamese aircraft to shoot down a U.S. Navy aircraft next FL Tramp Nocz San scored a 1811 on an \(\alpha\)-84 Sybrak. The first US, Air Force kill scored by MGi-17F was a 4 April 1996 when for Fresco C's surprised eight F-105 Tumberdiky over Thanh Hoa. Two of the MGi's (from by CAPT Tranh and his wingan) scored common hits on two of the 1963, showing how each aircraft. In this model we exchanged the Socialist Republic of Vietnam and April is now known as Aviation Day. The two unfortunate F-105 pilots were carried Jansson and MAN FAR Bennett.

On 19 April 1972 Nguyen Van Bai and his wingan, Levan Alen, Divot, cock room a secret in June in Qiang Bhungo and made a surprise bombing attack on two U. S. Navy destroyeds that were selling coastal defense guns sits in the Dong Hoi area. This was the first aerial attack on a Seventh Field hip since the Second World War. The two aircraft were modified for this special mission by engineer Truong Khanh Chau, a graduate of the Soviet Zhukovsky Aviation Institute. The aircraft were modified with a graduate to allow them to use the annual foreshor field and under this bomb tracks capable of holding a 5500 bomb bomb. One destroy was hit by a bomb causing minor damage, or the Moi's hits so that down by a surface-of-air mixing shell for the second destroy.

The primary duty of the NVAF MGi-17F force was to prevent American bombers and fighter-bombers from reaching their targets. Their tactic was to engage the attack force in combat agents that they were forced to drop their thorough loads, their main campar afford MGi-17F's could operate from improved airstrips making detection difficult. They generally patrolled at very low altitude along known American approach and departure routes and when enemy formations were spotted, the Fresco Csc climbed in full afterburner to engage the USN and USAF aircraft. Most American pilots stated that they fared the cannon armed MGG-17F far more than the missile equipped MGG-21PFM Fishhed F.

There were sixty-one MGG-17's shot down by USAF pilots in Vietnam between 10 July 1965 and 14 February 1968. The first MGG-17F Bill, however, went to the Navy, On 17 June 1965, two -F4B Phantoms of VF-2 aboard USSS MIDWAY ran into four Fresco Cs south of Hanoi and shot down two of the Fresco.

The North Vietnamese Air Force was equipped with a mixture of Soviet built MGG-17F and Chinese manufactured's-GSG-17F3 delivered from both countries. Reportedly, most North Vietnamese pilots preferred the MGG-17F over the more advanced MGG-21PFM and MGG-21PFM because of its maneuverability, robust construction and gain parameter. Most North Vietnamese access got their kits flying both the MGG-17F and the MGG-21, including CVI, Toon. This NVAF pilot was credited with thirteen kilb and was the VNAF fog soering before we have all in an engagement against a Navy-F4D Phantom.

His first kill was made an 20 April 1967 and then kills the National Aerospace Engineering of the Fresco, Nguyen Van CoC scored in the kills, while Luu Hay Chao, Mai Nan Cuo, Pham Than Ngan and Nguyen Hong Nili all scored eight kills. These pilots had all gained at least a portion of their students flying the MGG-17F.

During the entire Vietnam conflict, the Americans lost twenty aircraft to the MGG-17F and the VNAF lost a third-party-two Fresco Cs for a kilb of 4.64 to 11 in favor of the Americans. A part of this success can be credited to the fact that the USAF and USN had been able to obtain two MGG-17F3 through clancline channels (officially USAF never acknowledged that they possessed these Fresco Cs).

The two aircraft were ex-Syrian Air Force aircraft captured by the IDFAF. On 12 August 1968, during a routine training mission, two Syrian Air Force pilots, Valid Adham

## Shenyang J-5

The first Five-Year Plan created by the Chinese Communist Party called for local manufacture of both jet fighter aircraft and trainers. During December of 1951, a plan was submitted stating that production should start within three to five years. In May of 1953 China and the Soviet Union signed an agreement where the Soviet would assist China in some 180 projects, among these wherein projects relating to the aviation industry.

Under Soviet leadership, the Shenyang Aircraft Factory, which had started as an aircraft refuge system, was under consideration and expanded. Also at Shenyang, the Chinese Chinese Party in the Aero Engine Factory which was intended to produce Soviet jet enriches. Initially we planed to manufacture the Mid-151susp under license of Shenyang; however, in October of 1954 the plans were changed and it was decided to undertake the license manufacture of the Mid-151F water the designation J-5. The Chinese also undertook the manufacture of the YK-IF power plant under the designation WP-5.

Documentation for the Mid-151F airred during 1954 and in April work began by translate these documents. Prototype production started in early 1955 at Shenyang with the Soviet Union supplying a complete set of drawings, technical documents, details of the manufacturing processes and most of the funding. The Sovits also supplied two Mid-175s to serve as pattern aircraft, fifteen knocked-down kits, foring and raw materials for an aircraft, vendor furnished equipment for eight aircraft and standard parts for fifteen aircraft.

Final assembly of the first aircraft assembled with parts totally manufactured in China was completed on 13 July 1956. On 26 July a full full size airbeam passed is static test and an 2 August the first flight was completed.

On the 1956 National Day. Chinese manufactured J-55 were shown to the public for the first time when a formation of four early production Fesc C3 flew over Tian An Men Square in Peking. Production of the J-5 were steadily; there were seventeen built in 1956, 142 the following year, 429 in 1958 and another 179 in 1959. A total of 76 J-5 were manufactured between 1956 and 1959, with production of the J-5 at the Shenyang Aircraft Factory lasting only one year longer than production of the Mid-17F in the USSR.

The J-5 was generally similar to the Mid-17F, although it did not carry the Sovits 2 tail warning radar and, while the Soviet Mid-17F has had a single access panel on the port side of those, the J-5 has an access panel on both sides. Most J-5 carried an SRU-0IFF blade antenna on the fuselage spine, but J-5 never carried the SRU-1M radar range finder or button ECM antennas.

J-5 was assigned to combat reigments of the People's Liberation Army Air Force and Navy has been combat in number of incidents. According to Chinese sources by Nationalist Chinese F-84Gs and six F-86 were not down by the H-7-5-sluring test. In 1958, O-07 October 1959, a Navy J-5-sd down was a Chinese Nationalist RR-47D, which was returning to Taiwan from a sky mission over northern China. The Nationalist pilot, for some unknown reason, started his descent while still over China and came within range of the J-5.

### J-5

There was no two seat trainer version of the Mid-17 produced in the Soviet Union since it was considered that the handling characteristic of the Mid-17 were so similar to those of the Mid-17's that pupils could easily transition from the two seat Mid-1SUTI divided to the Mid-17.

The situation in China, however, was different. During the late 1950s, the Soviet Union had supplied a number of Mid-1SUTs (J-2, but there was no production of the Mid in China. As time progressed it became apparent that these aging Mid-1SUTs would have to be replaced by a trainer of Chinese design.

Finally assembly of a J-5 (MIG-17F) at the Shenyang Aircraft Factory, The Fresco C was up on 1956 to perform the drop checks for the landing gear. The site intake is covered with a Red protective cover and the canopy was also covered with a protective covering.

The Chinese bulk the Mid-17F over license at the Shenyang Aircraft Factory under the designments J-5F-5). The first J-5 produced with an Chinese manufactured parts rolled out on 13 July 1956. A total of 76 J-5 were built between 1956 and 1958.

Polish Built MIG-17s

Poland began production of the MIG-17F Fresco C during November of 1956 under the designation Lim-5. During this same time frame, the Polish Air Force began searching for a replacement for its B-10 piston engineed ground attack aircraft and after careful evaluation of several proposals it became apparent that the Lim-5 would be the best basis for a ground attack aircraft. The specification for the conversion was jointly drafted by the Polish Air Force Command, the Science Research Institute of the Air Force and a team of engineers from the Wisk-Mice factory, where the Lim-5 was produced. The new project was given the designation "CM" and was lead by Felbis Borodzik. Standard Lim-5(sentials IC-10-30 and IC-16-01) were converted for testing. In order to improve the aircraft's STO capabilities the wing area was increased from 243.2 feet to 252.2 feet by extending the wing root area forward. The wing root area (out to the first wing air flow fence) was enlarged and used to hold additional feet links. This raised the internal fuel capacity to 499 gallons from the 364 gallons on the standard Lim-5. The inward wing fence was enlarged and wrapped around the wing leading edge to a position just in front of the main wheel well.

In addition, the rear fuselage was modified to accept SR rocket boosters, the main landing gear was completely redesigned with dual wheels and modified main wheel doors. The VR-2 radio altimeter antennas were moved from the wing to the underside of the fuselage along a circular centferencing.

This new variant received the factory designation CM-11 and the first prototype CM-10-30 began testing on 2 July 1959 under Stanislaw Kurk. During testing it was discovered that the nosewfied needed to be strengthened due to the aircraft's increased gross weight.

Production of the CM-11 at Milece was authorized under the designation Lim-5M and the first production aircraft (IF-01) rolled out of the production line on 30 November 1960. Three were not a total of six aircraft built in three production batches with the aircraft being assigned to both Air Force and Navy units for operational evaluation.

The Lim-5M carried the same span arrangments as the MIG-17F/Lim-5, a single N-3TD cannon and two R-23 cannons. Additionally, a single 250 kg (551 pound) bomb could be be carried on the underbaring QL-50 bomb rock instead instead with 10 waterhouse fuel tanks. The bomb rock could also carry the eight short MARS-1 rocket to which held eight S-5 rockets.

The Lim-5M had a take off run (with afterburner) of 710 to 770 meters (2,329 to 2,526 feet) which could be reduced to 350 to 370 meters (1,148 to 1,214 feet) if the optional SR rocket equipment was used. The landing run could be substantially reduced by the use of a braking parachute which was stowed in a container under the lower rear leakage.

## Lim-5MR

In addition to the standard Lim-5 and Lim-5M, a number of aircraft were produced by the WSK factory at Milece as photographic reconnaissance aircraft under the designation Lim-5MR (R for _Ropersonacy_ -- Reconnaissance). These aircraft carried a single AFA-39 camera in a fairing under the nose on the porst side.

## Lim-6

The Lim-6 was an improved version of the Lim-5M designed to eliminate the short comings of the earlier aircraft. In order to reduce the landing roll, the braking parachute and its consumer were collected from under the rearstage to a bullet speed finding far. The base of the order. Tests had revealed that the parachute could, and did, suffer damage when deployed from the old location eliminating the parachute's braking effectiveness. Additionally, the standard Fowler type flaws were replaced with both flaps and used high pressure air held from the engine. The center and outbound wing force were also significantly modified and the diameter of the air intake was slightly enlarged.

Flight resting revealed several problems with the Lim-6. During the first test the with the Lim-6 prototype (CM-16-0) engine suffered compressor stall. It was thought that the modified air intake caused the problem but even after some modification, the problem remained. It futter was discovered that it was the bleed air system for the blown that causes the compressor stall.

Onterest was still discovered that the turbine was prone to overheating. Fibttests had two production Lim-6 were also milder disappointing. The aircraft had poor elevator control and stability problems caused by the blown flues and enlarged its roots. Reports coming in from combat units evaluating the Lim-5M were also negative regarding the aircraft's flight characteristics, mainly caused by the enlarged wing roots.

There were a total of forty Lim-6 aircraft produced (1J-64-01 to 1J-64-04) but none of the aircraft ever reached front time units.

### Lim-6bis

Tials with the Lim-5M and Lim-6 clearly showed that both types were far from ideal. The flight characteristics and especially the handling during takeoff and landing were simply too demanding for the average fighter-pilot. As a result, neither the Lim-5M or the Lim-6 were assigned to operational front line combat units and work was begun during 1962 to develop a new fighter-bombher variant of the Lim-5.

Polish Lim-5s take up positions on the runway for mass parade takeoff. The Red painted file file identifies the aircraft as part of the 1st Squadron. The Red truck in the background is a Sovert built 2S-150 Red truck, widely used by WARSAW Pacet forces.

The new variant reverted to the original MiG-1JF wing and landing gear, modified with an underlyingylon being mounted on each inboard wing panel. The aircraft also was filled with the bullet shaped SLI-9 braking parachute container at the base of the rudder and RV-Ury radio altimeter antennas on the under fusage centerline.

The new variant received the designation Lim-6bis. Before series production of the new aircraft began, a number of earlier Lim-5M and Lim-6a airframes were converted to Lim-6bis standards. The first aircraft converted as a Lim-6bis which left the WSK Factory at Milee during March 1963.

The Lim-6bis underlay option was mainly used to carry a Polish manufactured MARS-2-rocket (although it took around slowbands) and, as with the standard Lim-6bis-TGF (1J-67), the underlying drop that took be prolonged by a4D-60umb back for carrying bombs or rocket pods. The MARS-7 was a improved version of the Soviet 1B-16-57-1D rocket pod which used the S-5-57 short unpguided air-to-ground rocket. The use of the MARS-2 rocket pod made it necessary to install an AS-PAN gun signal and the PO4-rocket control panel in the cock of the Lim-6bis. Additionally, all Lim-6bis aircraft had the SLI-7M radar rangefinder antenna installed on the nose.

Once conversion work on the Lim-5M and Lim-6a airframes was completed two batches over newproduction aircraft were built for a total of seventy aircraft. The last Lim-6bis built (serial 1J-64-04) left the WSK-Milee factory with the tactical number. Red640, on February 1964.

Initially, all Lam-6bis aircraft were delivered in Natural Metal Lact, during the mid-1970s, aacent cambouling pattern was introduced. Over the years the Lim-6bis has carried a number of different cambouling patterns and colors. The Lim-6bis remained active in the Polish Air Force until mid-1992 when it was announced that the aircraft was being retired.

### Lim-6R

There were a number of Lim-6bis aircraft modified with an AFA-39 camera mounted in a fairing under the mid-fusstage for the photo reconnaissance role under the designation Lim-6R.

Groundedrews carry out routine maintenance on Lim-5s on the flight line of Polish Air Force Base. The aircraft in the underground, Red 103, came from the the first production batch (serial 1C-01-03). The tip of the drop tank and the fin top are in Red.

A number of Lim-5P were exported to the German Democratic Republic, but these aircraft carried the Soviet designation MIG-17PF in German service, even through they were built in Poland.

### Lim-6M

During the 1960s, the MIG-17PF had been largely by the more advanced and effective MIG-21 Fishbed. As a result, the Lim-5P was declared obsolete for inter-ecrotator duty in 1971 a decision was made to convert the remaining Lim-5P airframes to fighter-bomber role.

The R\(\gamma\)-ray radar and associated equipment was removed, but the radones were retained. An A\(\Delta\)S-PAM gun sight and a PO-4 rocket control panel were installed in the cockpit and an underwrong python was mounted under each night under this panel. In contrast to the Lim-6M, the Lim-5P conversations carried on S\(\Pi\)-19 braking parachute housing. The conversions received the designation Lim-6M and all were delivered from the factory in a camalofage finish.

When the Defense Test and Support Evaluation Agency (DTSEA) began to purchase Eastern block aircraft, at least two Lim-6Ms were among the aircraft acquired. When these aircraft took pair in their first (and only) exercise at Kirndraft AFB, New Mexico during the Fall of 1988, they carried the underwering pylons but no MARS-2 rocket pods.

### Nose Development

Besides producing the J-5 (MIG-17F) at the Shenyang Aircraft Factory, the Chinese also produced the MIG-17PF all weather fighter under the designation J-SA. As in the case with the J-5, all of the documentation, tooling and equipment had been delivered by the Soviet Union and the Chinese produced aircraft is virtually identical to the Soviet MIG-17PF.

Production of the J-SA was assigned to the Chengda Aircraft Factory and the work on the first prototype in May of 1961 (with considerable help from specialists from the Shenyang Aircraft Factory). A full set of production drawings was completed by the Chengda Aircraft Factory in September of 1962 and component manufacture started in March of 1963. Static tests were completed in September of 1964 and the first flight of the J-5A prototype took place on November 1964 at the Yanlage Airfield.

The Openfield test was completed and the operational and medical performance was approved, the J-SA was certificated for mass production by the Military Products Certification Commission in December of 1964. The followingyear the mass production of the J-SA commenced. The J-SA became the Copels Lleration Army Air Force's first all weather fighter. Later, a number of J-SAs were reportedly exported to North Vietnam.

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:47]

This Lim-SP (1D-04-09) was the ninth aircraft of the last Fresco D production batch and was delivered during late 1960. This aircraft was equipped with a camera pod under the nose for an AFA-39 camera.

A few East German MG-17PFs were camoufuged with Earth Brown/Olive Drab uppersurfaces over Light Blue undersurfaces, although the four digit tactical number was not used (perations). This aircraft was later put on display at Cottbus, home base for the 1st fighter Regiment.

## MiG-17PM Fresco E

The MiG-17PM (MiG-OKB designation SP-9) became the first Soviet interceptor fighter equipped solely with air-to-air missiles. This practice followed a trend started by the Americans. In the late 1950s it was believed by many that future fighter aircraft should only be armed with air-to-air missiles which could destroy enemy aircraft at far greater ranges than was possible with aircraft guns and canmons.

The first Soviet built air-to-air missile was the RS-20A (AA-1 Alkali), a beam riding missile which consisted of a fuse and warned (first colon), the steering fins and autopilot (second), rocket engine and batteries (third section), stabilizing fins and pneumatic system (fourth colon) and radio controls (fifth section). The RS-21-weighted 8.3 kg(184 pounds), had a speed of 1,650 kmh (1,025 mph) and the warned was equipped on a proximity fuse.

The AA-1 Alkali was equipped with a simple semi-active radar guidance system that honed on the radar energy from the beam generated by the carrier aircraft. If the AA-1 did not the target narrow-three seconds of flight without self-destructive. When the proximity fuse contained the warned close to the target, the explosion produced some 830 fragments, shredding the target.

There were only a limited number of MiG-17PM produced for use by the Air Defenses Forces (PVG) and when Western observers first spotted the missile armed off-17 during 1958, NATO assigned the ASCC Reporting Name Fresco E to the MiG-17PM.

There were a number of changes between the common armed MiG-17PFreco D and the missile equipped with diG-17PM Fresco E. The three NR-23 canmons, gun blast panels and shell ejection blisters were deleted and the opening faired power; however, the aircraft retained the CS-19 game camera on the starboard side of the nose. Two APU-missiles are used on each wing to carry the AA-1 Alkali missiles; whereas

The RP-55-Scan Odda read on the MiG-17PM was replaced by an RP-2/_Uzambar_ 2 radar system. This system was still quite similar to the Scan Odder except that it had an increased scan range (2,000 meters for the RP-5 and 3,500 meters for the RP-2U). A Green light was installed in the cockpitful thatished when the target was between 3,500 and 1,500 meters. A Red lamp flushed when the target was within 2,000 meters, which was too close for a successful missile firing.

Since the AA-1 Alkali was a beam rider, the MiG-17PM pilot had to illuminate the target until missile impact. Any sensitive maneuvers would break the lock-on and the missile would go ballistic. Multiple missiles could be launched using the same illumination beam.

The AA-1 Alkali could be fired at ranges between 1,950 and 7,000 meters (6,397 to 22,966 from the designated target. It could been used at altitudes ranging between 700 and 16,600 meters (2,296 to 54,462 feet). Due to the conical shape of the radar beam, accuracy deteriorated rapidly the farther the missile was from the carrier aircraft.
