(Top far left) This view shows the _FI156C-3_ version with its rear defensive machine gun position behind the trailing edge of the wing. Notice how the outward bulging cabin transparencies allowed the crew members good downward visibility, as well as obviously good vision to the front, rear and sides.

(Bottom far left) The long overcats worn by these _Luftrexaffe_ officers tell a story about the African desert that isn't always clear. On many nights, and even during the early morning daylight hours, the temperature often hovered near the freezing mark. This view of the _FI156C-3_ shows the dark green mottle sprayed over the desert sand base camouflage. The undersurfaces retained the light blue coloring common to most other _Luftrexaffe_ aircraft.

(Left) Just before takeoff the ground crew members check to make sure that everything is all right before closing the _"Streck's"_ door. Notice that a second officer has entered the aircraft and is now sitting strapped into the rear seat of the _FI156C_. The leading edge slats on the wing have been fully extended to enable the airplane to get into the air in a hurry.

(Right) The sleeve insignia on the flight coat of _General Feldarnschal Albert Kesseling_ is that of an _Oberstfautement_ (Lieutenant Colonel). Here, he buckles himself into the seat names of the pilot's seat in what appears to be a very roomy _"Flease" Streck'_ cockpit. The device directly behind the pilot's seat is a laminated metal seat support that doubled very nicely as an armor plate, protecting the pilot's back.

(Left) Here we see the rear of the _Fieseler F156C-3's_ cabin and defensive armament station. Notice the open side panel giving access to the rear cabin and fuselage area. Also very obvious is the internal metal tubing that made up the sides of the fuselage framework. The tightly stretched fabric skimming on the fuselage was put on by a grating it over the top of the fuselage, pulling it down over the sides snugly, and then facing it up like a boot on the bottom of the fuselage along the aircraft's centerline. A proper job produced a fuselage skin that was as tight as a snare drum.

(Right) The pilot has dropped the flaps a good fifteen degrees and is applying full left rudder to counteract the propeller's pull as the engine is run up to full power. The aircraft's single \(F\),92 mm _MG 15_ hand-held machine gun has been installed into Its bubble at the rear of the cockpit canopy for the forthcoming flight.

A close-up shot of the side of the _F1158D-0_ ambulance aircraft, coded _D-EMAN_. The _Luffreaffe_ medical orderly is holding up the swinging side door of the aircraft, showing where the specially built aerial stretcher carrying a wounded patient could be sild in or out of the fuselage.

Only a close look at the fuselage of this _F1158C "Storch"_ will reveal that the skin covering the airplane is stretched and doped fabric. This _F1158C_ carries an antenna mast, possibly for high frequency _Funggerat Foo XVI_/ radio transmitter-receiver combination; a feature not seen on very many "Storch" aircraft, except those that acted as air control and guidance aircraft for German fighter-bomer and ground attack formations.

In this photograph German and Runanian General Staff officers exchange saturates before a _Fieseler "Streck"_ bearing Romanian national insignia. The Runanian general is wearing an Iron Cross First Class on his breast and has just been awarded another medal, hanging above the breast pocket flap. The Runanian "Streck" is one of about fifty _F156s_ sold to the Runanians. There are not many photos of Runanian _F156s_ in existence.

With her oil cooler and exhaust pipes showing, this _Fieseler "Streck"_ forms the backdrop for a _Luffwaffe_ marching band as high-ranking _Luffwaffe_ and Navy officers form for a funeral ceremony somewhere in Germany. The shoulder develops worn by the _Luffwaffe_ bandsmen in the foreground were typical of those worn by all military musicians in the German armed forces; a tradition that carries over to today's _Bandeswehr_.

This _F156C-3_, coded _H9BF_, of an as-yet unidentified unit receives a tankful of fuel at a forward Russian airfield. The aircraft in the rear of the photo is a _Fock Walk FP 58 "Weithe"_ twin engined lialison aircraft, covered in more detail in "_Luffwaffe_ in _Action Part III"_, _Soundreon/Signal Aircraft Number 4_.

A beautiful shot of six _Arabae Ar 1964-5_ floatplanes of _S.A.G.r 128_ lined up in echelion formation for a seventh _Aasde_ carrying the photographer. All of these aircraft are fitted with the _MQ #7_ twin machine gun unit in the rear cockbits.

## 1 ArADO Arteo

Floatplane

The _Arabae Ar 196_ floatplane was Germany's most successful naval aircraft during the Second World War. For the first half of the war the _Ar 196_ was used primarily as a ship-borne maritime reconnaissance and artillery spotting aircraft, as well as an anti-submarine warter aircraft. Ternary end of the war she was used mainly as a shore-based short range reconnaissance aircraft. The _Arabae Ar 196_ was by and large the single main aircraft type to be carried aboard German capital ships for catenoid launching; several battle-ships carrying up to four _Arabae_ on board.

The first experimental _Ar 1968 (D-HEHK and D-Htai)_ were equipped with two-bladed propellers, but the standard series version, the _Ar 1964_ was equipped with a three-bladed propo driven by a _BMM 132K_ radial engine that produced 960 horsepower on takeoff.

The _Ar 1964_ was built without any major changes or modifications throughout its production run, which spanned five years. A total of 435 aircraft were built between 1939 and 1943.

Because of the various missions of the aircraft and the hazards it faced on board ship and in the open seas, mixed construction was used throughout. The wings were all metal, while the fuselage was constructed of metal tubing, with metal skinning used for the forward part of the fuselage and tightly stretched fabric covering the after sections of the fuselage. The tail surfaces were of all metal construction with fabric covered control surfaces. The floats were constructed entirely of metal.

The _Ar 1968_ was equipped with a pair of 20nm _MQ /FF_ cannon, one mounted in either wing, it also carried a single forward-firing 7.92 mm machine gun infring through the coupling and propeller arc, and either a single _MQ #5_ machine gun in the rear cockbit, or a twin barreled _MQ #7_ machine gun on later versions. She could carry either two 50kg (100 lb) bombs or a pair of small captured French depth charges under her wings.

(Left) A striking view of the big _At 1964-3_ floatplane being brought up from the beaching ramp on a wheeled dolly towed by a tractor. This floatplane was amplified with a single forward-fitting _at 19647_ in the forward fuselage fitting through the coupling, a pair of 20 mm _at 200-FE_ carmon in the wings, and a defensive _at 19645_ machine gun fired from the rear cockpit.

(Right) The large crane hook is being guided toward the lifting cables of this _At 1964-3_. This aircraft is armed with a pair of _SC 50_ 110 lb bombs; one slung under each wing. Notice the rear-fitting _at 19645_ machine gun on its mount in the rear cockpit.

(Left) This shot shows the mixed construction used on the _Azado Ar 196_. The cowling and forward fuselage skimming is of lightweight metal alloy, while the rear fuselage is made up of metal tubing, wood strings, and a skinning of tightly stretched and doped fabric. The pilot of the aircraft wears a summer one-piece flight suit and is armed with either a _Watther PP_ or _Watther PPK_ automatic pilot in the holster on his belt.

The big _BMW_ radial engine whips up a fine spray in the faces of the ground crew personnel as they guide this floatplane down the ramp toward the water. These aircraft were of hardy construction and could withstand the rigors that came from operations on the high seas for months at a time.

Banking gently, showing a pair of light French depth charges under her wings, an _At 196_ flies on patrol over the North Sea. Although this aircraft is attached to an operational _Luffreaffe_ unit, the code letters designating the unit are too small to be legible.

(Below left) **GW*YN**, an _At 196A-3_ of _See Autkilarungs-Gruppe 128_ (Marine Reconnaissance Group(126)) forms out of the calm waters of the French coast near Brest in the early spring of 1943. Only a few months later this unit had been transferred to the south of France where the aircraft operated over the Mediterranean Sea.

After a long flight, the crew of this _At 196A-3_ climbs nearly out of the cockpit and down on to the float. She still carries her depth charges under the wings, indicating that the flight was not successful one in terms of enemy engagements. The ground crew personnel wait patiently for the leaching dolly to be brought down the ramp so that the floatplane can be towed up for servicing, refueling and another patrol.

With the wake of the low launch showing white in the foreground, this _Donaler_ Do24 is pulled out toward the breakwater of the harbor for another patrol. The pilot and the navigator can be seen with their heads out of the cockpit, wearing the cock-filled "sausage" type life jackets that were later replaced by inflatable rubber life tests.

## Appendix DORINER Do24.

In 1935 the Dutch government contracted with the _Donaler_ works for a flying boat capable of serving the naval forces of the Netherlands East Indies. Utilizing design features that had proven themselves in earlier designs, the _Donaler_ staff developed a three-engineered flying boat with a high wing and the small fuselage stub wings similar to those on the _Do17_, _Do15_ and later, the _Do18_.

The _Donaler_ Do24. As it was designated, was capable of operating on very rough seas with very little trouble aside from an occasional case of seasickness. Several types of powerful were fitted, but the Dutch decided on the Wright Cyclone engine and _Donaler_ swapplied a small number of completed aircraft while the Dutch tooled up a factory to build _Do24._s under license.

The design of the Do24 was good, so _Donaler_ manufactured a few more in Germany so that the _Laftew_ could try them out. Those that went to the Dutch were designated _Do24._ The _Laftew_ did not commit itself to buying any _Do24._s at the time because World Mar Two had stated in earnest by then. When the _Laftew_ next took an interest in the _Do24._ they had occupied the Netherlands and had taken out the _Do24 factory_ there, lock, stock and barrel. Orders were given to continue production of the flying boats in Holland until the end of 1940. Those Dutch _Do24._s that had been captured intact were designated _Do24._s toward the end of 1940, the _Do24._s received an engine change. All of the Wright Cyclone engines were changed to _Map_An excellent shot of a big _Domizer Do247-1_ as she receives a maintenance checkup on her three _BAM Brane_ 323R-2 radial engines. These big radials put out 1,000 horsepower each on taskoff. Interesting is the manner in which the cowling engine access panels folded upward, while the integrally-built access stairs folded down from the side of each engine.

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:31]

(Left) A fine view of a _Do24_ being towed to shore by a motor launch. Visible in the background is an Italian **Cam 2 50** segalme. The **2 50** was used mainly as a reconnaissance aircraft and she spots a white tuesialge and engine maeelist with red-orange wings for high visibility when forced down at sea. A close look will reveal gun turrets on the engine pod and on the fuselage behind the wing.

(Below left) _Ludwerwerte and Kriegsmarine_ personnel in the motor launch tow this _Do24T-1_ toward the jetty. This _Do24_ is armed with a large 30 mm _MK 100_ common in the dorsal fuselage turret; a gun that had a relatively low rate of fire but packed an extremely large punch when its rounds struck their targets.

(Below) As the rest of the crew of this _Do24_ debarks after a patrol, a _Ludwerte_ segment-crewman stands at attention on the bow and gives his report to his superiors. The crewoman closest to the engine maeelies has just dropped his life jacket through the open cockpit hatch and the camera has caught it in mid-air.

(Left) Creemen help a wounded and exhausted pilot out of the fuselage hatch to the stretcher traced on the flying boat's spine. These big seaplanes did a tremendous job picking up downed alimentary and sailors drift at sea wherever and whenever they could be picked up.

(Below left) a fine view of _KD@RH_, a _Do24_ tied up to a buoy in an Italian harbor, along with a troop transport ship and a destroyer bearing the code letters _CN_ on her bows. _KD@RH_ is equipped with the long-barreled 30 mm _MK107_ common in her dorsal turret.

(Below) A last minute check of the center engine requires these _Lurkestte_ crew members to ascend to the top of the wing of the big seaplane as the motor launch continues its its losing. Notice how the _Doralier_ rides evenly through the white-capped water as it heads for the section of the harbor set aside for seaplane takeoffs and landings.

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:35]

(Left) here is a good view of the pilot of a _Do24_, taken from within the cook-pit. The cook-pit window panels directly above the pilot opened up for quick entry or exit. Because the big flying boat sat so low in the water she had to be completely buttoned up on takeoff and landing, especially in rough water, as waves could enter the cookpit and possibly swamp the boat.

(Below left) As all three _BMM_ engines rear, this big _Do24T_ picks up speed for takeoff, building an ever-growing wave of spray beneath her bow. The three _BMM_ engines were capable of giving the pilot over 3,000 horsepower on takeoff. More than once these flying boats were so overloaded with downed airmen that the full power of the engines could not get them into the air.

(Below) The _Dennier_ lifts awkwardity out of the water on her way to a long patrol. The nose revert of this aircraft appears to be unarmed, but the dorsal turret on the tuselage carries a 30 mm cannon and the rear turret is fitted with a 7.92 mm _MG 1S_ machine gun.

(Above left) _CHWEW_, a _Donier Do24M-1_ (built by the Dutch for use in their armed forces) belonging to the Air-Sea Rescue Service-Med-iterranean shows her water streaked undersurfaces to the photographer as she heads out to sea on another long rescue mission.

(Left) A close look at the boat hull of this low flying _Donier_ reveals that she has just recently been re-caukled on all seams. Because of the punishment the hull took on every landing, it was common for the seams between the panels on the hull to spring leaks, so caulking on a regular basis was a necessity.

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:40]

_Me 323 8_ were constructed in two major series. The various subtypes of the two major series were:

_Me 3230-_ F First operational version. Fitted with six _Gnonne-Rhone 14N_ engines that produced 720 horsepower each. Two-bladed fixed pitch properties were used. There were five separate defensive armment stations with _M6 15_ machine guns installed, and a further eight to ten windows through which _M6 34_ machine guns carried by troops could be fired.

_Me 3230-_ Basically the same as the D-T variant except for minor modifications in internal equipment and fuel tank arrangement in the wings.

_Me 3230-_ F This was the version that was produced the most. It featured more powerful _Gnonne-Rhone 14N/49_ engines that produced 980 horsepower each. The five defensive armment positions had been upwind with _M6 137_ 139 mm cannot. Some _D-6 s_ were fitted with up to sixteen defensive gun positions to act as defensive sensors for large _Me 323_ formations on long missions.

_Me 3232-_ This version was fitted with six _Gnonne-Rhone 14R_ engines that produced 1,100 horsepower each. The defensive armment of the D-6 s_ series was carried over, but added to by the inclusion of two _H14 15/120_ turtes located on the superwaters of the wing.

_Me 3235-_ Basically the same aircraft as the _E-T_, except for the substitution of 13 mm cannot for the _M6 15/120_ carmon in the turtes and the addition of yet another two _H14_ turtes in the wings, making a total of nine _M6 137_ 13 mm cannot for armment.

A Huge _Messerschmidt Me 3232-1_ of the Second Group of Transport Wing 5 _(Transaporegesbehavior)_ visits to be loaded up with troops and cargo on an advanced airfield in southern Russia. The large columns of smoke in the background of the photo indicate that the fighting is uncomfortably near the airfield.

Here an _Me 3235-T_ awaits yet another flight to the front after servicing. The _Me 323_ in this shot is one belonging to the First _Gruppe_ of Transport-gesbehavior_'s that was operating in the southern area of the Russian Front during the summer of 1943. The _Me 3232-1_ was characterized by the two _H14 15/120_ aerodynamic gun turtes on the superwaters of the wings, each mounting an _M6 15/120_ 20 mm cannot. Earlier versions of the _Me 323_ did not have these turter mountings on the wings.

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:42]

(Above) This ground crewman balances precariously atop the tall ladder while the services one of the six _Game-Rhose_ engines of this _Me_ 323. Each one of these French engines, originally intended for use in their own bombers but captured and used instead by the Germans, produced 1,100 horsepower on takeoff. The bilistered and peeling paint on the needle behind the cowling indicates the wear and long hours of service this aircraft has had in the recent past.

(Above left) The long, large wing of this _Me_ 3230-6 serves as a sun shade for _Wewhmmer_ and _Lurker_ personnel waiting to be transported to a hot spot on the East Front, or else westward to a safe place in the rear. A few hours of sleep during the hectic days of the _Wewhmmer_ retreats along the Russian Front were an award that many soldiers and airmen valued more than the Iron Cross.

(Left) Crewmen work on one of the ten big main landing gear wheels of this _lessessment_transport. These wheels had to be big in withstand the forces of landing made on grassy, bumpy and otherwise unsophisticated runyers of the East Front, Calite frequently the _Me_ 323 and its full cargo combined weighed over one hundred thousand pounds. The landing gear had to be sturdy to support that kind of weight.

In this shot, a big _Massarch/mit Agent_ of _Transporges-schroder_ 5, coded **C*******CB** rests at Odessa 1 all airfield during March of 1944. During this time _Transporgeschroder_ 5 was engaged in flying evacuation missions out of the Crimean area. The First _Grappe_ of this _Grappechroder_ live more than two thousand missions within a two month period during the evacuation of the Crimean; a testimony of the aircraft's hardness and to the men who flew and serviced them.

An _Me_ 323, probably of _Transporgeschroder_ 5, is refueleded from the fuel truck in the foreground. Members of the aircraft's crew have gathered around the side door of the tugging, discussing the flight and priorities for cargo loading, while two ground crewmen on the top of the high wing tend to the gasoline those which snakes up from the rear of the fuel truck some 25 feet below.

(Above) A large group of _Wehmsacht and Lutzwaffe_ personnel wait patiently for the doors of this _Me 323E-1_ to open so that they can be evacuated to the rear. This _E-1_ belongs to _Transporgeechweather_ 5, a wing that operated _Me 323E 8 from their introduction in 1942 to the end of the war. Once the two channelsil doors are opened the camps placed in front of the airplane will be moved so that vehicles can be driven up into the fuselage bay. (Above left) Here an _Me 323 "Gigant"_ (Giant) of the First _Grappe_ of _Transporgeechweather_ 5 gets ready to take on a large load of supplies an airfield near Foscal in Romania during the spring of 1944. As can be seen, this was less than ideal weather for flying, but the importance of the mission called for flying in all but the worst of weather conditions. (Left) With the equipment loading finished and the clamshell doors closed, these wounded troops are led forward to enter the side door and occupy whatever space is available. An ambulance with severely wounded troops stands by to unload first. Note that the engines are still being serviced while the wounded soldiers emplane; a sure sign that everyone is in a hurry.

(Above right) An **88mm** _FA14/36**_ still-purpose common is loaded into the fuselage of this **3225-f**, still mounted on its _Sonderwahmager 201_ trailer carriage. The machinegun mount on the clamslaml door on the left of the photo is barely visible inside the door. (Right) A half-tracked prime mover and its **50mm** _PAK38_ anti-tank gun drives out of the great fuselage of this **3230-f**, Notice how the **40****323** sat on her tail until she was loaded, at which time the nose dropped and she sat on all ten main wheels. The **D-6** could be distinguished from the **E** series aircraft by the fact that the **D-8** had no uppeing turrets, and their nose machine gun positions were mounted higher up on the clamshell doors than those of the **E** series.

(Left) Another stretcher-bound patient is loaded into the cargo compartment of this **the 323**. Often **the 323** * were so heavily loaded that the pilots made three or four tasked runs before burning up enough fuel so that the afterwards light enough to become airborne.

Net enough can be said about the process of these pilots who flew the wounded out of encirclements with all of the consummate skill that their training and combat experience could give them.

(Above) A severely wounded soldier on a stretcher is carefully moved from the ambulance on the right into the cargo compartment of the **the 323**. Visible directly in front of the national insalia on the fuselage is one of the waist defensive machine gun positions fitted with an **MG 137** 131 man. These machine gun stations were protected by an armor shield, through which the gun was mounted. The rest of the airplane was unarmed, protected by a single thickness of tightly stretched doped fabric.

(Left) This shot, taken from the rear interior of the **"_Bigant_" shows the wooden planself floors and metal tubing that made up the framework. The way on the floor of the fuselage has been put there to provide a semplance of comfort and warmth for the wounded in the absence of any other built-in creature controls. Visible as squares of light are the two bow defensive machine gun stations in the clamshell doors of the nose.
