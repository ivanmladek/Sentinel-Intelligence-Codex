Introduction

So much has been written about the F-111 during it's career that it will be all but impossible to come up with anything new or starting. Ironically, the great predependence of what has been written has been favorable, and yet most people on the fringes of the professional aviation community still regard the F-111 with the suspicion that it has been a costly mistake. There is no question about the fact that the F-111 is an expensive piece of machinery. But a mistake it is not. In fact, the Air Force has, in the F-111, exactly what it originally wanted, which is an airplane that can do all the things of the F-105 could do, (which is to deliver bombs on targets deep within energy territory by flying very fast and low enough to get under energy radar) but with more range, accuracy, and off airfields less than half the size required for the Thud.

The traged of the F-111 is that, in order to accomplish these feats, it had to pioneer in several previously untrode technological underness. This is not necessary anything new for a advanced weapon system, but the F-111 was centralised during two minutes, but he then a crash light of political squashing. I guess you could say that the trouble started with the Air Force calling the F-111 a fighter, when in fact what they had asked for in Specific Operational Requirement 183, issued June 44, 1960, was a electrical straighter - really a bomber. (F-1116 still still get itself) if you call their airplane a bomber. In fact, the name tags afflicted to my flight suit and flight jacked for my F-111 flight bore the insertion: "Mr. Lou Drened, F-111 FGIFIFER PLOT.") If they had called it an attestor fighter, a fighter-borne, its mission might have been more clearly defined in the eyes of the great masses of the unwanted - the American Public, who we argue to fit with their tax dollars. But a fighter? The name lighter carries with it the concentration of air-to-air combat, a mission never suited to the F-111. The major media, operating on the reverse of that old rule: "It you can't say something good, don't say anything." found plenty of bad things to say about the F-111, conveniently ignoring most of the good things.

If the image of what the Air Force sought in the F-111, or IFEAS it was then called, was less than clear in the public mind, neither was it crystal clear in the mind of the new Secretary of Defense, Robert S. McNamara.

To further mudry the waters of the F-111 saiga, enter the U.S. Navy. If you know anything at all about the American military, you may sense the ingredients for a first class political struggle with both major services involved with the acquisition of a major weapons system, which the Secretary of Defense insists must serve both - in completely diverse roles. McNamara, fresh from Fort Motor Company, had decided that a billion dollars could be saved in the TFX were designed to meet USAF requirements for its rightright, and Navy requirements for its Fleet Air Defense fighter. Thus was born the curse of the whole program - commonmantly. It may have been a dream worthy of the new Cameloid of the Kennedy administration. But in actuality, it was a dream that was beyond the reach of technology.

From the very beginning the military was opposed to the whole concept of commonality in the TFX, and they repeatedly told McNamara so. They were basing their judgment on state-of-the-art technology, while the Secretary of Defense was determined that necessity was the mother of invention, and the community of the USAF/USh TFX was a definite necessity in his eyes. Unfortunately for McNamara, the modern combat aircraft is a great deal more complicated than the 1960 Ford, and in the end the initial judgment of the military proved to be all too correct.

The Navy Fleet Air Defense Fighter had been envisioned by Navy planners as a subsonic platform for the long-range Eagle missile being developed by Bendix. The Navy had contracted with Douglas to build the FADF, under the designation F-6D Missifier, the F-6D had been built as originally planned, it would not have been anywhere near a versatile weapons system as the Navy eventually got in its place - the F-14Tont. But cancellation of the F-6D program was one of the last acts of President Eisenworks Secretary of Defense, Thomas Gates, leaving the new Secretary of Defense the problem of overseeing a replacement for the Missifier. And along came Mr. McNamara with his granduge scheme of an all-purpose ring. In this initial preparation on the subject, McNamara ordered that all the services (Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marines) should study development of an aircraft that could perform all of their tactical missions, including strike, close air support, air superiority, and fleet air defense. He eventually backfed off on all of these requirements except the strike and fleet air defense missions, leaving the Navy and Air Force to fight for what they wanted in the resulting aircraft. If the concept of commonality was to be adhered to, a great deal of compromising was going to have to occur, and neither service wanted its mission compromised.

With the services resigned to at least going through the charade of developing the dual-service TFX, the Request for Proposals went out to industry in October 1961. Within two months, six bids from nine different companies had been received, including individual efforts by Lockheed, North American, and Boeing, and dual proposals from General Dynamics/Grumman, McDonnell/Douglas, and Republic/Chance Vought. This set the stage for further battles.

All six proposals were rejected as unsatisfactory, but the General Dynamics/Grumman and Boeing proposals seemed to be the best of what had been offered and on the strength of this, official evaluators recommended that the companies require paid study contracts so that their offerings could be brought up to speed.

One of the healthiest raps Secretary McNamara took over the whole TFX after was his choice of General Dynamics/Grumman to get the contract. The military had almost unanimously favored the Boeing design, (a notable exception to this was the Air Force Systems Command, which would have overall responsibility for development of the Air Force [TEX]) and since Vice President Johnson was from Texas, the cry of patstain politics was raised. This brought Senator McClellani's Permanent Sub-committee on Investigations into the TFX picture, and assured more mudrying of the waters, as the politicians sought to manufacture politicians at the expense of the TFX.

As it turned out, the choice of General Dynamics was based on sound reasoning, and cannot be seriously faulted. In the first place, Boeing was designing their TFX around the General Electric MF-295, an engine that existedas a set of specifications only and probably could not have flown before 1967. The GD design used the Pratt & Whitney TF-30, which was to have powered the F-6D and was well along. The Boeing design also wanted into previously uncharted technological waters with the use of top-mounted engine air imlets, thrust reversers, and the use of large amounts of titanium. All of these things served to make the Boeing design look great on paper, but would have undoubtedly caused even more delays in the operational debut of the TFX. And finally, the Boeing design for the Air Force and Navy versions shared less than 50% commonality that word again of parts, while the GD version was 80% common in both versions. McNamara considered the Boeing proposal to be for two different airplanes. They were not playing the game according to the rules he had set forth. On November 24, 1962, he announced General Dynamics as the winner of the competition.

The award of the TFX contract did not inhibit critics within or outside of the military. Senator McClellan's committee continued to investigate the TFX contract, but in spite of several allegations of conflict of interest by members of the Department of Defense, no formal charges ever stuck. I think it is safe to say that most of these allegations were made in the interest of political advantage to those making the charges.

The Navy, on the other hand, had good reason to doubt that the General Dynamics/Gurman TFX would ever be operationally feasible. The main Navy compliant aside from the fact that they would be getting an Air Force developed airplane) had to do with the weight of the F-111. Put very simply, it was just too heavy to operate from all but the newest and largest of Navy Carriers. In spite of a succession of programs initiated to reduce its weight, the F-111b Navy versions never got down to the required weight. The effect of the F-111b Navy versions never got down to the required weight. The effect of the weight reducing programs, known as Weight Improvement Program, Super Weight Improvement Program, and Colossal Weight Improvement Programs 1, I-II, will, in two reduce the original commission of versions from 80% to less than 30%. So, millions of dollars and seven years later, community was killed by Congress when it refused to fund the F-111B any further. The "key" based a huge sign of relief and went on to develop the F-14. All \(\mathrm{m}_{\mathrm{i}}\) time and money was not wasted though, since the F-14 program did benefit from the additional development time given the remarkable Hughes AVG/9-Brouchas Missulewens System and the TF-30 engines.

Before describing the developmental history of the various F-111 variants, I feel it is necessary to attempt to cease some of the stigma that has dogged the F-111 since its TFX days. As said earlier, the F-111 in service today is just about exactly what the Air Force said it wanted way back in the late 50s. If anything, it has proven to be more than the Air Force could have hoped for, since it has proven to be a remarkably adaptable platform for technological advances in avionics and engines. The only mistake made in the F-111 program of major consequence was the attempt to make it all timings to all people, and refusing to accept the fact that this was technologically impossible. There have been developmental problems, but compared to all previous supersonic fighter aircraft, the F-111's safety record is amazingly good. It is with this in mind that the reader should judge whether or not the F-111 is a lemon, or one of the best combat aircraft ever produced anywhere.

F-1111 Development

## F-111E

This is the basic configuration. It made its first flight on December 21, 1964, sixteen days ahead of schedule. On the first flight, wings were locked at 26 degrees (minimum) steps ago at which time and six can be used. On the second flight, which was made on January 1965, test pilot Dick Johnson swept the wings fully at, This flight was made on January 1965, test pilot Dick Johnson swept the wings fully at, This flight was made on January 1965 and scheduled on January 1965.000 Johnson had intended to attain a further boost by demonstrating a supersonic flight at this time, but there is no difference between the baselines of the F-111 program as encountered, as the T7-30 engines contained severe coverage studies.

The T7-30 engines were the first alternative motion engines, and enable the F-111 life flying at a medium speed with low specific test consumption, or to the F-111A, The comparison was still a similar, to the sunbing with an aircraft, and is caused by excessive energy of attack to turbulent airflow, in the case of the F-111, problem was caused by the engine in that, this was not immediately apparent, and the airplane was prompted with the engines which have so much to "natural" by modifications. These resulted in the dash "system of the T7-30 and included modestly static inlet and compressor speeds with damped base angles spinning at different speeds, a sixth time speed to increase total distance at high speeds, and a one after another time could switch when modifications, compressor stalls are applied and to the further modification of the F-111 tasks for the A model and larger intakes for subsequent models of the F-111. The T7-30 engine, maxwidths technological breakthrough though it has caused many of the problems associated with the F-111 program, most of each oscillation to crashes. (The cost of the engines tried, while the airplane costs of the A model actually won down.) But you were sure a baseline that operational. A part of PRTA Whitney engines enabled while attached to an F-111, "General Dynamics into the fourth of all of the bad publicity, while having little or nothing to do with government acquisition of the power plants.

Some of the strongest opinions-on of the whole F-111 program came as a result of McNamara's personal involvement with the best program. In late 1965, the Secretary of Defense assembled the top civilian contractors in the program for weekly management meetings, General A. L. Exposito, the F-111 Project Office in the Pentagon, was not invited to the meetings. It was probably just as well, since the meetings themselves were somewhat of a judge, and did little time than provide ammunition for the witness of the media.

Meanwhile, Category 1 testing was continuing with the aircraft, and the F-111 was building an impressive safety record which was not shattered until the number nine aircraft was brought to land until the wings at 50 degrees sweep, which would not have been notable had the pilot been attempting an intentional landing in that configuration. Unfortunately, he apparently thought he had the wings at 16 degrees, and landed short, destroying the aircraft.

The real disasters in the test program came in 1968. Three of six F-111s sent to Southeast Asia for current evaluation were lost, that episode will be covered in the combat portion of this book and reads were discovered in the wing carry-through box. The F-111 was grounded while modifications were made to strengthen the assembly.

With this modification, it was thought that the F-111 would be able to complete the test program forthurbation. Unfortunately, one of the F-111s sheds a high level of December 1969 during a full out from a low-level bomb. Since reaching bad been within limits during this flight, the tests pointed to another serious law. The F-111 was grounded again for inspection and proof testing of every one of the 260-F11s, then in service. A fair was found in the lower plate of the wing pivot fitting of three more of the aircraft and corrected. Though this program still follows it, did prevent these more crashes.

By the time the test program was completed, the F-111A had the distinction of being the most thoroughly tested airplane over four hours by the USAF. (Even before it had managed more than 20,000 hours in the wind tunnel which, compared the F-1068 3,000 hours and the B-568 6,300 hours is a stageoning amount).

The test program proceeds that the F-111s showed one of the best aircraft ever bought by the USAF, as every major requirement for the safe aircraft was met or selected. Among them, the aircraft to produce an 35 maintenance man-hours per per right hour (for the F-111 unit of NEIS FAR demonstrated a minimum of 19 and an average of 30 per aircraft, as it used within five minutes of Later (day 14 in these minutes), required no more than 15 minutes for identifying any test, he ready to fly 75% of the time and remain on continuous alert for five days at a time. Most of the various of the unusualistic endorsement given the F-111 by flight and ground areas at NEIS.

Weapons are also carried externally on wing priors. The F-111A is eight simple options. The four indoor protons swift as the wings sweep so that the orbits at all times remain in line with the language. The onboard pylows are used in sub-sonic flight only, and can be letifused if the wings are to be swept beyond 26 degrees.

The F-111A introduced some of the most sophisticated airplanes were carried on combat aircraft up to that time. These provide the capability for communications, navigation, terrain following, target acquisition and attack, penetration of enemy feders and safe return of the airplane.

The navigation and attack set provides the crew navigation and guidance data from taketor to landing any weather. Used in conjunction with the aircraft's radar equipment, it provides accurate inertial navigation, course computation and automatic radar bombing capability. It constantly tells the crew position, attitude, track and speed of the aircraft and avoids it to the target by a continuous flow of commands. In addition, it supplies data for automatic radar bombing and for automatic updating of the aircraft's position. With this subsystem, the F-111 can also perform an instrument 6

The attack radar set performs mapping that shows a clear picture of the ground or airborne targets, regardless of visibility. If simultaneously reports the changing range between plane and target, corrects navigational errors and performs radar photography, the terrain-following radar (TPR) can be set for fly the plane automatically at a selected low-level clearance above the ground for concealment from energy radar.

A "GEE WHIZ" F-111 MISSION

I might not have been salivating at the thought of flying in the F-111, but I was not in the least bit apprehensive either. As a firm believer in the non-existence of "commonality" (at least, the kind of commonality which led to the controversy surrounding the life and times of the F-111) kind tried to get as current in the operational capabilities of the long-nosed super tighter-bombet as a civilian can. After ten years of reading and clipping everything 1 could find on the one-elevign, I had come to the conclusion that it was probably a bit of a bit better at what it did than any other airplane in the world, and that much of the criticism is that developed has been either ignorant, or self-searing, or both. I was looking forward to a first-hand demonstration of the big fighter's abilities, and by the time the big day rolled around, I was getting pretty excited about the whole thing... (short of salivation).

The big days was April 5, 1978. I was scheduled to fly with an instructor of the F-111 Fiber Fibreathsagon Soluctu at NEPA, Nevada. My pilot for the flight was Captain-Ioe Warsaw of the 422nd Flight Weapons Soluctu, a 1966 graduate of the Air Force Academy who had spent some 2300 hours in Air Forceighters, and a third of that in the F-111, soft-spoken six-footer, too largears radiated quiet confidence in his own abilities, and outpostpost confidence in the F-111. If there is something about the F-111 that, Joe Narasage does not know, I was not able to find out what it is in two days of talking about the airplane.

We began our preflight briefings with a session in the one-eleven simulator. The F-111 simulator, like most modern civil and military simulators, is almost as much a technological wonder as the real thing, having the capability to duplicate almost anything you can do in the airplane. There is a complete F-111 cockpit, which is just as hard to get into as the real airplane and behind it. An L-shaped twenty root bank of instruments, backed by computers. The panels on this six foot high array of technical windary are adopted with all manner of in-flight conditions, (ranging from the subline to the teriflying) which can be shown to the crew in the simulator itself. A technical watchers over all of this, and can spring any emergency on the crew that he wishes with the flick of a switch.

The F-111 can be flown by one man, but unless he has extremely long and facile arms, he is going to need some high with the right seat switchology, so we concentrated on getting me up to speed on what to turn on when I turn on.

Our ultimate target for the flight that afternoon was NEIS Range 62 or, as it is more popularity known, "The Dogbone". The Dogbone is a dry lake which gets its name from its shape. There is a radar reflector at one and which serves as the target. The simulator gives you a good picture of the Dogbone, and I was able to eventually put the radar convs on the target. After an hour of playing with the radar, Joe climbed into the left seat and we want over the emergency procedures.

One of the unique features of the F-111 is its escape capsule. If the crew is forced to punch out, either crew member can initiate the ejection sequence by squeezing and pulling one of the yellow ejection handles that protrude from the center console at his inside knee. When that happens, explosive charges separate the entire cockpit section from the rest of the airplane and a rocket motor blasts the whole thing 350 feet up, up and away from the rest of the airplane. A stabilizing drogue is deployed and the capsule falls to 15,000 feet before the main chute opens. Air bags are inflated under the capsule to tension, and flotation balloons reminiscent of those on space capsules pop out of the stop to make sure that, if you land in water, you will eventually end up right side up.

The hairtest part of a one-eleven ejection (after parachute deployment) is the landing. That is where most injuries occur, and Joe cautionned me to adjust my seat as near to a rerolling position as possible. This meant getting rudder goals all the way forward and tilting the seat back to the rear. Short guys may have the best of it in this situation, since there is room for a five-and-air-buff-core to get fairly well situated. My six footers just have to hope for strong vertebrae.

Joe covered one emergency situation that might confront us, since we would operate in the two regimes where it is most likely to happen. It was failure of the windscreen, which might happen at most because of the combination of heat and dynamic pressure, or at low level as the result of a bird strike. If it did happen, he said, we could expect a lot of noise, buffeting, and truly flying around the cockpit. It would be unnering, to say the least, and how much have his hands full, regaining and maintaining control of the airplane and, he warned me, restraining the from ejecting both of us until he was sure that the situation called for ejection. It would be impossible to talk, so everything would have to be visual: If the was incapacitated, it would be up to me to get us out. (I made damn sure I knew how to operate the ejection handle in aircraft. (Later camoufage schemes for TAC F-111s employ matt-black undersurfaces). Weil, enough gawking, Joe is about done with the preflight, and it's time to climb aboard.

I climb the ladder, paving at the top to remove helmet and mask from my helmet bag. The bag gets folded and stowed under the seat, then I climb into the cockyl. This is not like any fighter I have ever been in... the "sechats are actually comfortable, and connecting bag belt, shoulder harness," (?oi), and oxygen mask leads can be done easily without the aid of the soliticious crew chief, who has followed me up the ladder.

Joe is now in the left seat, and strapped in... we are ready to start the engines. Somewhere behind us, and to the side, the crew chief has the APU going, and as I watch the engine instruments, the RPUs begin to build. First one, then the other nightly TF-30 lights off. The APU is disconnected and wheeled out of the way. The crew chief has stationed himself on the left side of the nose and has radio communication with us. Joe goes through the control checks, cycling the flags and salts up and down, the wings back and forth, and the stabitatory through their full travel while we wait for the inertial Navigation System to align itself.

The INS is one of the many marvels that make the one-eleven a "Buck Rogers" airplane, it enables the one-eleven to fly anywhere in the world, without the aid of external navigational aids. All you need are the latitude and longitude of your destination, or destinations. (You can feed several separate destinations into the computer, which will truthfully store them, then direct you from one to the next.) It will also tell you exactly where you are at an times, what your true groundtrack is, and how fast you are going. Since the first part of our mission involved a mach run, we put in the end of the supersonic corridor, then the entry point for the low level run. Once into the low level portion of the mission, we would put in the additional coordinates needed to navigate our way to the target.

As the INS aligned itself, we went through some additional checks. I turned on the attack reader. (was warned to turn it "on" only, not to "transmit", since when transmitting, it will not put high-powered beams of energy, and could involve anybody who might venture in front of our GBS backs nose). Next, came closing the weapons bag doors, and checking my communications panel. Joe was busy checking the flight control and autopilot systems and the Terrain Following Radar channels. (For another technological miracle... the F-111 flight control system is "get-adaptive, it senses changes in flight conditions and automatically makes adjustments for pitch, yaw, or roll deviations and gives the same control "feel" through all portions of the flight envelope, from just above stall speed to mach 25. Ed, and from wings tilt forward to full back. It is triple redundant, which means that if one circuit fails, there are two others to carry on. Only two systems of this kind have ever been installed on operational aircraft, and the X-18 had the first.)

Thirty minutes after we had arrived at the airplane, Joe leaned over and pulled our call sign onto the placard in the center of the panel, then called ground control for clearance to taxi.

"Ringo 65 cleared to taxi to runway 21, Neillis altimeter 29.86." A final salute to the ground crew, a nudge on the throttties, and we rolled onto the taxway.

As we rolled along the taxway, I took note of the fact that the F-111 left like a Cadillac, especially in comparison to many other fighters, whose stiff

When Bill collected his "Golden 'SB', he had been flying the F-111 for just over a year. His narrative of that year provides an in-depth look at the F-111 control record.

would come. We both had survival radios, and they were working just fine. It was the last 1 was to see of Bob for more than a month.

It was the beginning of the week in North Vietnam, and though the area we were in was not Unk lucky, the tail grass was quite wet, which made for a high degree of discomfort in the cool temperature. It found what thought was a good hiding place, and settled down to wall for daylight, and our resources.

The North Vietnamese soft in foreving to Q400 the next morning searching for us, I had picked a hiding place right next to what was apparently one of them tallis up the side of the hill, and I spent most of the day literally frozen in place. I was so muchtoneless that I would up with a principal hence in my arm, which was under all my.

They had a portable radio and were listening to Radio Hanan, which I had assumed was knocked off the air by the bombing. After what seemed like an earth, they moved off the air.

I spent the next thing moving to new hiding places. The weather in our area was so bad that left over some airplane that we could call our survival radios. On the third day, a flight of Sandy A-7s came into our area. Since Bob was closer to the top of the mountain, he did all the talking, relaying whatever I had to say. The clouds were still too low for them to come down through, but we were able to talk to them, and they imported our position. Unfortunately, at the end of our transmission, I heard fifte fire from Bob's position.

Bob had been hiding in some wines, and the North Vietnamese hard apparently hard hailing. One of them earnsing down the hill and just by chance steped on him. The started Vietnamese backed up, and fired, tackled, he missed, but that brought the rest of them on Bob. No trips of fire that head were signs that they had caught an American. They traveled him off to Hanoi, and I was left alone... Almost. The paths in my area continued.

On the north day, the A-7s returned, pinpointing my position, and then said that they were low on fuel and would go out to a faster, as on your return. Well, by the time they got back, the weather had locked me in my and bought it back down.

The next day the weather cleared, and the bombing of Hanoi resumed in earnest. I spotted a big 0/7 A-7s withouton their target and called them, but they wouldn't answer. Apparently they reported the call to the Sandies though, because it wasn't long before they were over me. After determining my position, they left to a helicopter.

As I have would have it, there was just one 50 caller gap position in the area, and the helicopter fire right over it on his approach to my position, and they really hannered him. His refueling boom was all but shot off, the co-glot was seriously wounded, and they were leaking fuel. To his credit, the pilot still tried for the pick-up, I had not given them real explicit instructions on my position though, and they came to a never about twenty feet from me, on the steps side of the hill. I decided that it was now of never, and made a run for the penetrator, which was on the end of the cable, Just as was about to make a gap for it, I lost my footing and the downwash from the big bit-fit<3 knocked me to the ground. I did a backill, and order to hour this. When I got up, the helicopter was leaving. I can't really glume them... they were were fired well up, and may have thought that I had been hit by ground fire. As it was, they just barely made it out to a Lima Site in Los, where the back-to-July Green picked them up, I later learned from the Comlat Camaran on that helicopter that the North Vietnamese were running towards them, firing their AK-7s, while they moved over me.

Why the North Vietnamese editor's really comb the area I I'll never know... they must have known the helicopter was trying to get someone. But they didn, and I moved again that night.

By this time, the two limits of water that had been in my survival gear was long since one, and was getting mainly misty. The light mixy rain that left most of the time only served to keep the wet, cold and materla. The Unique instructions had told us about the water was and much attached to Ensth Vibration, but they had neglected to tell us that they were dry until well into the wet season. I drilled into several of these looking for water, but only found our airplane was hiding the day, several Vietnamese came up the tail tail close to where was. I would sweat that one of them spotted one of those plantbo, and examined: "LOOK AMERGEN"Amy, whatever he said precipitated a search of the area, I heard one of them coming way, and stucked uptime. In that lost my magnitude not in the jump for the helicopter, and that had produced most of the camouriage for my knee. I put my gloved hand over me, and he had, but again my heath, I heard and felt the grass being parked over my head, but again my kick held and the didn't see me.

Shortly after that, "A light of F-4s came into the area and called on the radio. The flight lead spotted by position and told me to move to a better area for pick-up. Rather than give instructions that the North Vietnamese might overhear and understand, he told me to move from Neils to my home. Neils is a private we had been based, and we had lived in Las Vegas, which is almost quite south north Neils. But have always considered lower my home, and that, of course, is almost the case of Neils.

The next day there was 10,000 foot overcast, and the A-7s pushed down through it and found me again. The leader called me said said: "They did you know you were right up against a "w", it didn't of course, and I moved away from it." He they started the house and envisions. They picked up a lot of return free, and told me that I was going to have to move to an area that was not quite so hot. In the meantime, they dropped a survival package that contained water, food, and batteries for my survival radio, which was getting weaker every time! used it. They gave me directions to the package and headed home.

I knew it was not area, because I had heard AK-7s fitting at them from pretty close to my position. I had to decide whether was best but test the hell out of that area as quickly as possible, forgetting the water that package, or to go for that water. If this, I was really nasty, and the new was 81% to the air floor of the water. I actually had to be a continuously made for the area in which they had said the package had fallen. Suddenly, I came to a pretty well been. I looked with was and stepped diapers across. Then trip they had strong at the edge of the trail was practically invisible, and the explosive cap that an amount it's disturbance was the first indication that I had was was swamping with them in no time at all, it didn't take them long to see. Then they just stood around a telephone and pointing at me. Finally, they got some guy to come up and tag me on the shoulder. 'I knew it was at all over.'

I stood up and made a gesture of water, and they were all over me. Funny thing, the first thing to come off was my Sight watch... then they got around to my gun and knife. They stripped me down to my underwater and boats and marched me down the hill to a base camp they had set up as a holding area to wait a truck to come out from Hanoi and get me. I had been on the ground, evading them, for a week.

## F-111c

Australia operates two squadems of the F-111 (Numbers 1 and 6, based at Ampherley, Queensland). The Australians were the first foreign power to enter into negotiations to acquire the TEX, completing agreements on May 28, 1968, with the signing of an order for 24 aircraft. Britain had agreed to the purchase of 50 F-111Ks at the same time, under the impression that they had found a "cheas" alternative to their STAR-TRE - The F111C program was delayed by the same problems appearing to E-111Ks.

In the 1970 the Australian government secured the input to cancel their order without the loss of detail investment, whereupon the F-111Cs were transmitted and stored. In the meantime, the Australian government were owned "xfel" as on a close-back arrangement, pending final disposition of the F-111C order. When the F-11 structural provisions had been worked out, Australia opted to go away with the acquisition upon completion of the necessary modifications to the way carry-through box structure. But in the meantime, the per aircraft price had been from less than 4 million dollars to 24 million dollars. Ifanium at Australian interest was extended and fine-tuned with the intention of attaining zero attention, with the result that Number 82 Strike Wing did not become operational until 1975.

F-111c are basically F-111Ks, with the longer ship of the F-111Ks, strengthened leading gear to accomodate the heavier gross weight of the C, and bigger ties. Cockpit is the same as the F-111Ks, except that the rightward control stick is responsible. They are illustrated here over Brisbane, which is close to their base of RAAF, and at the Kwailean Missle Range. Camoufage is similar to USAF patterns and colors for the F-111A (RAAF, POD)

## Chapter 111D

The F-111D is the third version built for TAC. It was the first of the F-111 family to get the more advanced MK II Avionics Package, which includes the AN/APO-130 attack radar, AN/APO-128 TFR, and the AN/APO-100 TRAW and CADC (Reader homing and Warming and Central Air Data Computer). The MC II Avionics are built by North American Roboari's Attraction Division and feature intricore directionality circuitry to improve reliability and power and to reduce weight. Continuous airborne system self-test and built-in ground test features assure accurate performance. The ML II system provides multimodal air-to-air target detection and conversion regardless of weather and clutter. Improved multi-to-ground vacuum delivery, improved visual and radar target detection and identification as well as other advanced features. The attack delay was the F-110 increased and it-at-off capability, if real detector and track airborne targets in clutter and provides a narrow continuous beam to use by semicircle radar hoping mistakes. The digital computer replaces the analog computer of the F-111A and E. A horizontal situation display shows the aircraft position, bearing, ground track and destination superimposed synchronization and simultaneous photo-s, F-111D incorporates the links of the F-111E, but matches them to the improved TF-30-r9 engines.

F-111D is flowm only by the 27th TFW. Rotating gloves at leading edge at wing root detect to 40 degrees to provide additional lift during takeoff and landing, and to allow operation of slats with wings fully forward. Also obvious in this picture is the difference in deflection inboard and outboard on slats. (Dave Menard via Jerry Geet)

## FB-111A

Conceived as an interim beamter to bridge the gap between the B-52-B 8-56 combination, and the ultimate channel bomber, the B-1, the FB-111A is basically an F111W with the longer wings of the Navy F-111B, and the more powerful FT-30-70-9 regimes. Early FB-111A trials retained the A-style innate, but later production models had the revised 611A phase. The original bias was to play by 283 FB, which would have replaced the B-58 and the B-52C, and B-7 models. In 1965, it was thought that these aircraft could be bought to 17,501 million dollars, after McNamara at office, Congress cut the total by 70 6 aircraft, which ended up testing 1,200 million dollars. The FB-111A pregun itself to be an extremely effective bomber, placing first in SACs bumping competition within two months of joining the active force. The FB-111A is capable of carrying overcoined or nuclear weapons, and in tests with the SRAM (Short Range Attack Misails) in which fringes were conducted down to 300 feet AGL at targets in all quadrants, the FB-111A bettered required performance by over 50%.

## FB-1111h

The career of the F-111 seems destined to forever be inextricricably bound to politics, and the probably never-to-be-built "H" model is no exception.

During the early 1970s the USAF and General Dynamics embarked upon a program to moderate and extend the life of the FB-111A. For the first three years of this program the improvements were in the form of technological advances applied to the existing airframe/engine combination. In 1974 it became obvious to General Dynamics that they could not go much further with the basic FB-111 design, whereupon they began work on a much more radically modified version of the F-111. Because of the Air Force determination to develop and buy the B-1, this program was not published. When Jimmy Carter decided that keeping an ill-advised campaign remains was more important than maintaining the integrity of the IRAD strategic concept (DCBAs, missile-function submitments, named penetrating bombers) and cancelled the B-1, the FB-111A was expanded into the imaglight. Unfortunately, the timing of this introduction made it seem as though General Dynamics had whipped up a cheap alternative to the B-1 overnight in order to capitalize on the Strong Congressional sentiment in favor of maintaining a viable named penetrating bomber force into the next century. Nottingham could have been further from the truth. When the FB-111A was introduced, General Dynamics had already expanded over $10,000,00 of its own

## E-1111a

The extremely high air defense threats encountered in modern warfare have made the Electronic Warfare aircraft an absolute necessity in today's Air Force, and the E-F111A will replace obstnoking E86-86 and E87-9s in the USAE interview. The E-F111A will be to provide the tacited strike forces with high-power steerable, directional ECM sampling against early warning, height liftor, ground controller, and acquisition markets fire basic areas of operation. In the barrier of financial efficiency, F-111A will often be the boundary between friendly and enemy forefoins, marking the energy and other long range surveillance farms. This jamming "green" defense (suffering) information on operations in friendly airspace, be in the forming up of a strike or routine logistics operation. The essential element of surprise is maintained. The close at support mission brings the EF-111A to the forward of the battle are to suppress the enemy's air defense while the strike force delivers its weapons. The penetration sector mission calls upon the EF-111A to cross over into hostile air space, accommodating incident risks aircraft to high priority targets deep behind enemy links. The EF-111A scene the strike aircraft by continuously handling the incident air defense elements along the flight path; it is in the latter situation that the EF-111A speed and range stand it in good steady, giving it an much higher survivibility than its lower enders.

Grumman was chosen as prime conductor for the EF-111A, based upon their experience with the F-111A phase in 3D-200 limiting system, which is carried by the Grumman EA-68 Provier. The ALQ-96 is the latest version of the power jamming system, and has been improved and simplified for installation in the EF-11A. The concept of carrying a power jamming system to a high performance aircraft began evolving in the early 1970s. The Air Force selection of the F-111A was based on its availability from inventory as a south-west asset, and its adaptability to the carriage and housekeeping of the required 5,000 N. of electronics equipment. It has demonstrated structural stability and long-to-lott characteristics, and it is compatible performance of the strike forces in terms of maneuverability and supersonic performance.

Active adaptation of the Jamming Subsystem to Air Force requirements and the F-111A began during the competitive design study/risk--reduction Phase I in early 1974. Full-scale development work began with the award of a Phase I8 contract to Grumman in January 1975.
