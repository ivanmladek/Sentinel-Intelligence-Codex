## Introduction

**Laftwaffe in Action** is a new concept. Between the covers of this book can be found some of the finest German wartime photographs over taken. There is no text to speak of, since we feel that there are enough publications available describing the aircraft in detail, but lacking the photo coverage that the discriminating collector and model builder is seeking.

Each of the photos is unique in the sense that only operational aircraft are shown. These are not manufactures' publicity photographs that have been seen time after time, but propaganda shots originally meant to be published in German wartime publications. At least 90 per cent of the pictures in this book have never been published before and it is our hope that you, the reader, will enjoy them for what they are.

Originally designed as a passenger and cargo aircraft, the DoHT was turned down by the dynamic national airline, Deutsche Lathaussischeische fur anwme kusliage made passenger comfort almost insensitive.

Because of its speed and performance it was still valuable for military purposes and the time distribution La Laftaufte gpus in several for further development at a bombar.

The was the first modern booster to be introduced into the Lathaussische and was well treated in action during the Spanish Civil tur., when the Polish campaign began, DoII's were being used an bombar, ratif aircraft, and recommissiona piano.

The DoT offered a large part is Germany's serial cohesive during the Bullio of Britain, but requested for leadership adhesive whenever and not-too-inpassive bomb load, and only 500 machines were produced and they produced it by it in a-docussing partners as a recommissiona piano, having given their bombarides the fastest and largest-event J4875. They also act as the Salihands, Greece, North Africa, the Soviet Union and Frause but attrition was so complete that not one then at the end of the tur.

Heinkel's He111 began in 1935 as a passenger aircraft for the Deutsche Lafthasasa and within five years had become one of the deadliest bombing aircraft of WWII. After its baptism of fire in Spain, it was selected by the Lafthasar as its standard horizontal bowler.

He111's operated over Poland, France, England, the Low Countries, Denmark, Norway, the U.S.S.R, and countries other European and African countries. It made heroes out of many of its crews and coppes out of others. It served as the backbone of Germany's bombing wings and solidered throughout the Second World War. Many think that the He111's operational career ended on May 8th, 1945 in countless German scroxyards, but she still serves today in Spain as that country's primary back-up bomber.

Another shot of the glassed-in nose of a He111H-L. The view afforded the pilot in this aircraft was unsupassed. Here, an amorer is adjusting the standard ring-and-bead sign of the forward firing **M0 15** machine gun.

This photo shows the ventral pondola of a He111H-L The early H variants carried a single **M0 15** in the ventral pondola for reward and belly defense, but later variants had the amament increased to either a twin **M0 812** mount or a 13mm **M0 131**.

The dorsal gun position of an early He111H. The early version of did not have a fully enclosed dorsal gunner's position, but later variants of the H series featured a protective glass cover and heavier amament than the **M0 15** machine gun.

The belly of this HeIIIIIIB-11 shows the external bomb tracks and the five externally mounted bombs. The bomb tracks were attached to strong points under the fuselage and wing sections and could be removed and replaced with bomb tracks designed especially for handling larger-sized bombs.

A single SC500 bomb is asymmetrically mounted on this HeIII. The aircraft on the right features the same type of bomb installation.

E. In this shot, the Ja88, now airborne, circles back over the air-field in order to drop the expanded rocket bottles by means of their own small graduates so that they can be refilled by ground personnel and reused in the future.

A. This J488A with a big bomb load is about to get a rocket-assisted task-off from a short airfield. This was not an uncommon sight on the Eastern Front where Russian airfields were very primitive, often being nothing more than a wheatfield or meadow.

B. Rochester Assist bottles were normally attached to **L****L****T****awfte** aircraft by means of small racks, similar to bomb racks, which were bolted on to the aircraft. The bottles could be used and then be jutilised once the aircraft was airborne.

C. Mary times during the campaign in the East, **L****L****Tawfte** aircraft were so heavily overloaded that rocket-assist was the only manner in which they could become airborne.

D. The rocket bottles could be ignited simultaneously for maximum thrust, or else fired off one after the other in a series of firings in order to provide sustained thrust. Each bottle had between ten and twenty seconds of fuel in it.

JUNKERS Ju188

The authors Jussel was the end result of two hours international experience with the Jussel. It was created in an attempt to improve some of the inherent deficiencies of the Jussel. When the Jussel was compared with its older brother, it allowed the area greater all-around visibility, more cockpit source, vastly improved defensive remained, increased using post and even for higher flight and more powerful engines for perhaps speed and a heavier tunnel load.

The Jussel was used both as a industrial and they bombard, a reconnaissance place and an a first, periodic, static, and a new 1000 Jussel were produced between them and 1648.
