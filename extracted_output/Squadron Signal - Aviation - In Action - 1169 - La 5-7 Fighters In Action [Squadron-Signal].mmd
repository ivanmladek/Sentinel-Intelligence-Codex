## 1 Introduction

The wooden, radial engined La-5 fighters from the drawing board of the Lavocchkin Design Bureau played a vital role in wresting air superiority from the Lathwaffe on the Eastern front. The top scoring Allied ace, Ivan N. Kozebukh, claimed all of his 62 aerial victories while IJ-Circumbation fighters. Korobacht flow his initial combat stories during OPERATIONS CITADEL north of Kurst, where he dowed four enemy aircraft and claimed his last victim, at the 262 jfighter, on 15 February 1945. A considerable number of Soviet acts claimed their kills in Lavocchkin fighters. Along with the inline engined Yakovlev figures, the Lavocchkin were the backbone of the Soviet fighter Aviation Regments during the Great Patritic War. Soviet factories built 9,920 La-5s up to November of 1944 when production switched to the more advanced La-7. The same factories built 5,905 La-7s until production ceased in December of 1945.

During the closing years of the 1930s, fighters belonged produced by the Soviet Union venture unique in one respect - no other country was mass producing modern fighters made of wood. Reports from various Soviet research institutes had established that metal, given the same strength requirements, was forty percent fighter than wood. Additionally, the advantages of metal's durability, free resistance, and ability to withstand severe climatic conditions were well known to Soviet scientists. Nevertheless, the light neutral alloys used in Western central construction were in desperately but supply in the USSR, whereas two was available in nearly unlimited quantities. Additionally, wood did not require the same level of highly skilled labor needed to form and assemble metal uiders. Therefore, it is not surprising that the prototypes of the three modern fighters (LaGG-3), 3-folds A-Y and Yak-1) were all built of wood.

The first weeks of war with Nazi Germany had proved the concept of building great quantities of fighters using wood rather than the more sophisticated light metal alloys. After the first few months of the campaign, Soviet production of light alloys had dropped by eightly percent, leaving wood as the primary material in new fighter construction.

### La-5 Prototype

The experiences of Soviet pilots with the in-line engined LaGG-3 during the early days of the Great Patritic War were disastrous. The aircraft was openly referred to as a'mortician's rate -- an aircraft whose intentions towards its pilots were no more benevolent than the aircraft and pilots of the Lathwaffe. This ensure of the LaGG-3 was not without justification since the fighter revealed much evidence of the haste with which it had been tested and admitted to production. All but the most experienced pilots found it a difficult to fully. If it was overweight, under powered, and unrigrigging. While the LaGG-3 was regarded as obscuring in early 1942 by the Commissariat of the People for the Aviation Industry (NKAP), production continued until the moment preparations were made to convert the production lines to more advanced fighters.

Shortly after the German invasion in June of 1941 an order was issued to the Design Bureaus of Lavocchkin, Mikoyan-Gurusch (MG), and Yakovlev to adapt the M-82 radial engine to their fighter airframes as a possible alternative to the inline engine. The Kremling regended development of experimental radial-engined versions of the LaGG-3, MG-3, and Yak-7 as a safeguard in the event output of the in-line Klimov and Mikhalin engines suffered during the move of Soviet factories to new complexes for behind the Uran mountains.

The 1676 horsepower (hp) M-82 radial engine had been developed by Arcrady D. Shvetsov and his team in their Design Bureau at Perrin in central Russia. Shortly after the end of State Acceptance Kitta, large scale production of the M-82 powerful began in May of 1941. Any interruption in production was unlikely since the factory was in Perrin, far beyond the range of Luftawaffe bomners. Although the radial engined prototypes from the MiG and Yakovlev Design Bureaus remained unique, the Lavocchkin proposal became one of the most successful fighters of World War II.

Senyon Mikhalishov Alekseevy, the deputy of Senyon Alekseevich Lavocchkin at State Aircraft Factory 21 at Nizhny-Novgorod, was in charge of the radial engine conversion program. He would also be responsible for designing the La-5's successor -- the La-7. (After the Atrever Alekseev established his low Design Bureau and built the Roils Royce Derwent powered 1-215 jet fighter that flow for the first time in December 1947). Alexeyey's conversion work began in late September of 1941 immediately after the main design bureau had been evacuated and from the Moscow suburb of Khinnik to Nizhny-Novgorod during the fall of 1941. The new radial engined fighter was designated the La-5.

A standard LaG-3 was taken from the production line to serve as the prototype aircraft equipped with the M-82 radial engine. Grating the lgeform (49.6 inches) diameter M-82 radial engine to a LaGG-3 fuselage designed to mount a 777mm (30.5 inches) wide Klimov M-105 in-line powertrain was to easy task. The design was further complicated by the differing thrust lines of the engines and substantially greater weight by 250kg/551 lts) of the radial engine. However, the 1676 hp M-82 radial engine, originally developed for the Su-2 bomber, offered considerably more power than the 1100 himo M-105pring as used in the LaGG-3.

The M-82 are engine ultimately became the most successful Soviet radial engine of World War II with a total of some 71,000 powerplants built in 22 different variants. The M-82 powest end both the La-5 and the To-2 bomber. The M-82 was also installed in various prototypes of the MG, PGtyakov, Polikorov, Sushoi and Yakovlev Design Bureaus. A special derivative, called Ash-82V was used after World War II on the Mi Mi-4 and the Yakovlev Yak-24 heli-copters.

A close fitting, tapered coupling was adopted and equipped with adjustable front towers to control the flow of cooling air around the engine. Front and rear fans were also adopted for warm weather operations. The caturotter intakes mounted in the leading edge of the wing roots of the LaGG-3 were eliminated.

Senyon Alekseevich Lavocchkin, one of the most outstanding aircraft designers of the Soviet Union, stands in front of his La-5fighters during 1943. After the war Lavocchkin was responsible for designing a number of missles, including the SA-2 Guideline surface-to-air missile used during the Vietnam War. (van Ivanov)Since the La-5 prototype was converted from a standard production LaGG-3, the cookpit and rear fuselage were nearly identical to the piston engined Lavochkin figure. Fuel capacity and motion of the internal equipment was also unchanged. The prototype La-5Gd, however, lack the leading-edge automatic slats and retractable tail wheel of the late production LaGG-3. Both times were later reintroduced on the La-5 prototype line.

A further modification on the prototype was the elimination of the ventral engine coolant radiator and its fainting -- both rendered unnecessary by the air-cooled radial engine. As a result the aerodynamics around the lower all fusedinguez were greatly improved. The oil cooler under the nose remained, but it was positioned to the rear and cowled under a smaller firing. The gas exhaust pipes to the LaGG-3 were eliminated. The exhaust manifolds of the radial engine were clustered together into a single outlet on side of the forward leakage of a front-type sensor of these thrust augmentation. The pipes were covered with a rectangular metal plate.

The M-82 engine tuned a new VBS-105V profile, while contemporary LaGG-3 was still equipped with the USB-II project. This modification resulted in a slightly enlarged spin-mer when compared with the LaGG-3. The enlarged spin-malobe weights used by the USB-105V profile? R-7 reduction grating. The halo and spin-malobe weights used by the USB-105V profile? R-7 reduction grating. The halo and spin-malobe weights used by the NIPS-layer interface for grating the engine when compressed air was not available for the self-starter.

Compared with the contemporary LaGG-3 (29th Series), the overall length of the La-5 prototype was slightly reduced from 8.81 meters (28.9 feet) to 8.67 meters (28.4 feet). Due to the heavier engine, the tube-of-sight was raised from the LaGG-3's 3160kgs (6966 bis) to 3380kgs (7451 bis) on the La-5 prototype.

Combite experience on the Eastern Front clearly demonstrated the superiority of large caliber exposures over six flaring, filling either machine runs. This had an influence on the La-5 prototype. The general armment of the earlier LaGG-3 consisted of a 20nm SNVAK common and a Beerich (DBS 12.7mm machine). Then, the La-5 prototype was armed with two belt-fed, gas operated Domain SNVAK canmons mounted in the upper forward leakage. Two small blisters were added to the upper fuselage between the engine and the cockpit to clear the guns' bocchres.

The LaGG 3, powered by a 1100 hb Kimov M-105 inline engine, suffered greatly at the hands of the Littwahte and was disabled by the pilots who flew it. Additional power seemed to be the answer. (Zdenek Ondra)

The La-5 prototype was completed in December of 1941, but ground tests revealed several problems with the new engine configuration which delayed his motion flight. It was not until March of 1942 than the prototype took to the air for its first flight with Alessetti Ivanovich Mashikhin, a highly experienced pilot assigned to the Soviet Air Force Scientific Research Institute, at the controls.

Factory testing of the La-5 revealed that the poor flight characteristics of the LaGG-3 had not been completely overcome on the La-5 prototype. Several detail improvements were made before the La-5 prototype was transferred to the Scientific Research Institute for State Acceptance Issue in April April of 1942.

Although the radial engined prototype was considerably heavier than the LaGG-3, the M-82 engine's greater power offered much improved performance over the LaGG-3. The La-5's speed at sea level was greater by eight kmh (4.9 mph), while the La-5's speed of 600kmh (372 mph) at 6450 meters (21.61 feet) was 84kmh (21.29 mph) higher than that of the LaGG-3 at 6000 kmh (1998). The climb rule was also superior with the La-5 prototype only six minutes to reach 5000 meters (16.404 feet). The results were promising in one other aspect -- a cylinder German B1092- was found to be slightly inferior to the La-5's prototype, whereas the LaGG-3 had been completely outlosed by the Messerschmitt.

Overall, the evaluation by the Scientific Research Institute demonstrated the superiority of the radial engined LaGG-3 and that it had the potential for being an excellent fighter -- at least by Soviet Air Force standards of the time. Trials lasted less than a month and the aircraft was cleared for mass production by the RNAP. Production began in July of 1942.

Since it was not totally clear at the time if the M-82 radial engine project would be successors, development of the inline powered LaGG-3 at the Lavochkin design between continued. For time the LaGG-3 and the La-5 were built alongside each other at State Aircraft Factories and new features and improvements were simultaneously introduced in both types.

## Laocchkin La-5

Flight trails of the La-5 prototype clearly demonstrated that it was superior in all respects to LaGG-3 and the La-5 was ordered into production. The first aircraft left the assembly lines in July of 1942. Apart from the Ash-82A radial engine, the La-5's airframe was nearly identical to the contemporary LaGG-3 (now the 35th Series) and for a time the two were produced table by side at Nizhny-Noygorod.

Production La-5s differed in a number of minor details from the prototype. First and fore-most, the 1676 he SB-25B engine used on the La-5 prototype was replaced by the new 1700 HB-SB2a powerpoint. The first production Ash-82A engines left the production lines at the Prem regime factory in April of 1942. The engine oil oil colour housing was squared off and enlarged below the cowling. A conductor air intake was shifted into the upper if of the cowl. A bugglet, centering flaring was also added to the upper surface of the cowl. The housing for the exhaust stub collector was enlarged and covered with a rectangular exhaust shield. Production La-5s also featured larger bulges over the first tenofue campo branches.

The engine's maximum continuous power is 1540 bp and 2050 meters (6725 feet) using a 7 l compression ratio and a two-speed supercharger. The M-82A was equipped with an A-82EB carpature, a 88.1-41 ignition system, a Type RPD-1 M pressure regulator, and a 65-350 generator. Fuel was provided from the five wing tanks via a BNN-106 net pump. The M-82A was designed to use 94 octane fuel. The VISH-105V three-blade, controllable-pitch proper with R-7 reduction gear was retained from the prototype.

The wing of the La-5s was slightly modified when automatic slats were introduced on the using leading edge. The addition of slats required moving the pitto tube from the standpoint wing leading edge to a position under the wing. A trim tube was added to the inner edge of each aireron. The wing fuel tank filler ports were combined into a single port and the single landing light in the port using leading edge was eliminated.

Behind the engine and engine accessory by the La-5's structure was virtually identical to that of the earlier LaGG-3 fighter. Its fusulae was a semi-monocoque design with physorod-stheed bircfan, triangular section southern strings, and skelting by slanning. The fusulae bar four main ingorsors and 14 strangers attached to 15 vertical box-frame bulbacks.

The DSP-10 delta wood used on the La-5 was developed at the All-Russian Institute of Aviation Materials "Alkowsky. It was built from five to eight layers of birch strips, glued cross-grain, and impregnated with VNA-83 (phenol-formidable) resin, borax, and boric acid) and used in conjunction with skelting ply. The skelting ply consisted of layers of birch strip bonded with baseline flint 150 degrees Celsius.

Details would was only used in the first production batches of the La-5, because the imported German resin was soon in short supply. As a result, the delta wood components were replaced by conventional pine. Although the wing gear flanges became thicker, there was no great difference in weight due to the lower weight of the pine versus the heavier treated beta wood.

The two-way wing used NACA 2301 profiles at the root and NACA 23010 profiles at the wing tips. The front sugar was straight along the entire wing while the rear was broken at the wing panel joint. The wings were skinned with 3mm (1 inch) plywood. The slotted aluminum alerows were fabric covere. The all-metal flaps could be deflected 50 degrees for landing and 10 to 15 degrees in combat to improve the fighter's turning radius.

The five wing fuel tanks held a total volume of 341kg (751 lbs) of fuel. The tanks were made from an aluminum and magnesium alloy overlaid with four layers of phenol-formaldehydeing resin-impregnated fabric to a thickness of 8mm (31 inches). In the event of buller damage, the resin fabric acted as a self-sealing agent within 10-15 seconds of coming into contact with the fuel. The fuel tanks were automatically filled with cooled, inner exhaust gases to inhibit the risk of fire. Gases from the port exhaust manifold were collected in a tube that led to a filter placed in the rear fuselage. The cleaned and cooled gases were then routed via a pipe to the five fuel tanks. The LaGG-3 and La-5 were the only modern Soviet figures using exhaust gases to suppress fires in front tanks.

The landing gear legs were fitted to the front spar wall and were hydraulically retracted into the wing and flaselage. During operations from mudy airfields it was common to remove the lower main gear door from the main gear start leaving only the upper stort faring in place. The main wheels were 650mm (25.5 inches) in diameter and 200mm (7.8 inches) wide. Production La-5s were equipped with a retractable tail wheel covered by a pair of doors. The tail wheel was 300mm (11.8 inches) in diameter by 125mm (4.9 inches) wide and was hydraulically operated. The doors were bugled to provide additional clearance for the wheel. This change was short-lived as the bugled doors were eliminated in favor of flush fitting doors.

The first La-5 production batches were equipped with the pitch of the contemporary LaGG-3 versions, but most production La-5s received an enlarged pilot tube.

The La-5's armman consisted of a pair of SWTA (Spitzhuber-Vadimov Aviatsionaya Krapoulizmova [Spitzhuber-Vadimov Large Caliber Camomol 20mm cmos mounted in the forward fuselage. The ShvAX had been developed from the highly successful 7.62mm ShvAX machine gun by Boris G. Spitzhuber and S. V. Vladimirov. The 20m camon became available in 1936. It weighed 42kg (92.5 hrs) and fired 750 to 800 pounds per minute. Its overall length was 1760mm (69.2 inches). The barrel alone had a length of 1245mm (49 inches). Each weapon was provided with 200 cmous.

The La-5 prototype and the initial production batches used the windscreen and canopy from the LaGG-3, but later production La-5s were equipped with modified units. The rounded frameof the windscreen was replaced with a rectangular frame and two additional cross frames in order to accommodate a \(\pm 55\)mm (2.1 inch) armor glass plate behind the windscreen. The rearmost vertical frame of the at sliding canopy was also enlarged.

The La-5 was equipped with the PRP-1A (_Pried divB Bombineutous S Pizzovanium_ [Bonth Sight for Dye Bombine]) and one for 300 km (168 ppb). The with two deflection rings - one for 200 km (12 ppb) and one for 300 km (168 ppb). The sight was unable to provide a fine degree of deflection and usually required bursts before, through, and after the target to ensure hits.

All La-5s were equipped to carry D3-40 bomb tracks under the wings, however the tracks were fitted to only a few aircraft. Boths to be \(\pm 50\)km (110 b) could be carried. Bomb types include and the EMI-50/A (_FAB- Expansion Avia Bombine] postprobe bomb) as well as the AO-25M and the FAR-50/M fragmentation bounds. The bonus were generally paired prior. Color codes were paired on the bounds to identify their purpose, although these were not always applied. Anti-norm bombs had yellow-red stripes, while fragmenting bombs had green and blue stripes around the body. Practice bonus were painted in white and red.

The cockpit was spratant by German, British, or American standards. Instruments included a K1-100 campus, US-800 speed indicator, VA-30 rate of climb indicator, TE-22 engine revolution center, TE-75 engine and oil temperature protocol instrument, and a Type AVK clock.

There were no gyroscope Instruments such as an artificial rotor system or gyro exposures.

The La-5 could be equipped with an RSI4- "Mabrikat" (_RSI4-Raidioreglia ditke_ [Radio or fighter]) radio system, through the system was not carried by all aircraft. The RIS4- consisted of a transmitter and receiver and usually only the lead aircraft in a formation was equipped with both. The remaining aircraft had either a receiver or only orbiting at all. The RSI4- "Mabrikat" (_p_ered vibration variable frequencies in a band between 3.7 and 6.05 MeVagelves. Frequency selection was by means of a knob under the starboard side of the instrument panel. Both the receiver and transmitter were powered by an RU-11a accumulator.

The system weighed 2kg (4.4 lbs).

The initial production batches were equipped with 10mm (39 inch) armor plate behind the plots seat. Later production batches were provided with 8.5mm (33 inch) armor plate in order to save weight.

By Western standards, the La-5 was an astree and unsophilicated aircraft. Nevertheless, its sturdy wooden structure, lack of complexity, and its limited demands on field maintenance made in perfectly suitable for the role and conditions in which it was operated by the Soviet Air Force - conditions which would have resulted in a much lower rate of successfully within a three associated fighter.

Despite the design's promise, however, the first production La-5s had a remarkably lower performance than the prototype, suffering a 40 to 50 km (42.8 to 31 mph) loss in top speed. Investigations by the Central Zero Hydrodynamics Institute (TsAG) at Dakovys indicated that the primary reason for the performance loss was drag from the handmade, ill-fitting engine cowling and the poor sealing of the engine accessory busy panels.

Another problem area was the poor swing from the cockpit that was worsened by the greater bulk of the radial engine. A high vibration rate at cruising speeds, caused by the poor mounting of the engine to the leakage, was also a common. Operational evaluations of the La-5 also showed that it was impossible to use the PRP-1A light properly when the two SAVAK sensors were fired due to excessive vibration. To make things worse, two La-5s crashed after losing a wing. One of the fighters was in a landing approach, while the other was in a shallow drive. A crash program was instituted to order to solve the problems while the La-5 remained in production. The pilot's seat was raised to provide a better field of view in all directions, the wing

Lavochkin La-5F

The La-5F derived its name from the new ASH-82F (F for _Forsirovanny_ [Boosted] engine. When Arcady D. Sistrovech placed the original ASH-82A powerful ima production at GAA-219 in Perm during May of 1942, it was to produce as many engines as possible. As a result the ASH-82A was considered 'immature' when it made its service debut in the La-5.5. Cylinder head temperatures were critical and had to be kept between 200 and 220 degrees Celis. There were numerous instances of the cylinders literally losing their heads when the pilot failed to keep an eye on the cylinder head temperature gauge. The loss of the cylinder heads and, in some cases, the complete disintegration of the cylinders speed a serious problem for the Shevets Design Bureau during the ASH-82A early service. Attempts to alleviate the problem and increase the engine's power resulted in the ASH-82F.

The ASH-82F had the same output the entire ASH-82A, but provided improved performance at altitudes above 1500 meters (4921 feet). At 1600 meters (5416 feet) the ASH-82F was rated at 1676 b, while at 460 meters (15,256 feet) the engine was still putting on 1450 b. Like the ASH-82A, the ASH-82F was operated with a conventional carloquette. Extremely the introduction of the new engine did not bring about any changes to the equine portion from the application of the 'Forsirovanny' logo (a red CYritic "F" in a yellow circle) on both sides the engine coupling. The logos were sometimes not applied and were sometimes overpined in the field.

The first ASH-82F powerbursts were fitted into the last La-5 production hues during December of 1942. The first La-5F left the production lines at the State Aircraft Factory 21 at Nizhny-Noyoygorod in March of 1943.

Apart from the new engine, the primary differences between the earlier La-5 and the new La-5F was an entirely new canopy that provided the pilot with a much improved view towards the rear. The rear fuselage docking was cut down and a new fixed canopy section was added. The new canopy provided 360 degrees of vision and incorporated a 66mm (2.5 inch) thick armor glass panel to protect the pilot's head and shoulders. The sliding canopy's rearmost vertical frame was reduced in width.

The unfuxechen was also redesigned with the La-5F now having a horizontal frame on top of the unfuxechen. This modification was first made on the La-5 in order to improve the mounting of a 55mm (2.1 inch thick armor glass glass shell the unfuxechen. A rear view mirror was also added to the unfuxechen, although it was sometimes removed by the pilots in the field.

The PSP-1A (Pizel dlya Bombometuja S Pikivovaniya [Bombt Skipt for Dive Bombning] of the La-5 was replaced by the more advanced PSP-1B (8 gain which had a less-type reflector of about two inches in diameter. There were two different rings, or for 200 kmh (124 mph) and the other for 300 kmh (186 mph). Like the earlier PSP-1A, however, for one degree of deflection could be obtained.

A small tilt was used to match side of the fuselage just below the unfuxechen to improve the cockpit ventilation. Poor insulation of the engine buy and inadequate ventilation had resulted in high cockpit temperatures in the La-5.

Initial La-5F production aircraft had the same radio mast and antenna configuration as the La-5. Most of the La-5s, however, we built in a thicker, forward shang mats. On the La-5 and the first production La-5s, both wire antennas are from the mast to the next and of the aerial subt on the La-5s with the forward shang mats, only a single wire ran between the mast and the aerial subt on the tail fan. A second wire ran from the aerial subt to a small bitter fitted on the next side of the fuselage next to the aerial mast.

The La-5F retained the fuel tank constrained and the inert exhaust gas fire suppression system of the La-5s, however, the two 65 lit (17 US gal) fuel tanks in the outer wing panels were deleted. Their use had been largely restricted to ferry flights and their removal, together with La-5/La-5F Developmentother airframe refinements, resulted in a weight savings of 160kg (352 lbs). Due to the reduced net capacity (the 1.2-5\(\%\) range dropped to 760 km at 472 miles) versus the 190 km (7.39 miles) range of the La-5\(\%\). The primary purpose of the weight saving efforts was to match the performance of the current versions of the Messersheim fit 1900.

During the production of the La-5\(\%\).the data wood portion in the structure was gradually reduced and the components were replaced by conventional pine. The wing spur flanges became thicker, but there was little weight penalty since the pine weight less.

La-5\(\%\) equipped with the all-metal spurs had the original three tank configuration of the wooden-spar version replaced four tanks -- all located between the main spurs. The two other tanks tested 1688 times (44.3 US off) of each vehicle while the outer tanks each contained 148 liters (39 US gal). There was no external difference between the wood and central spursed wings.

The small linker on the main gear door was also redesigned. The round blister on the La-5\(\%\) landing gear door gave way to a rectangular blister on the La-5\(\%\).

During April of 1943 on the new La-5\(\%\) fireshops was tested at the Soviet Air Force's Scientific Research Institute at Superlox. The La-5\(\%\) had a speed of 557 kmh (346 mph) at sea level and a speed of 590 km (366 mph) at 6200 kmers (203.41 feet) -- only 10 km long may then the La-5\(\%\).

features except for the occasional access panel or cover. The metal covered engine and engine accessory bay were another matter. These panels were often denoted and scratched due to hurried maintenance in the field. The metal panel immediately behind the exhaust was usually left in a natural metal state. The metal steps holding the covering together were flexible which resulted in much of the paint flaking off. This could often leave the impression of unqualited silver bands wrapped around the cowl.

The La-5F carried the red star with a small black outline until the fall of 1943 when a new insignia was introduced. The red star was given a wide outline which was then rendered with a thin endline. The insignising were applied to the fuselose slides, vertical subfilter, and the lower wing surfaces. The upper wing surfaces were not marked. A two-digit identical number was applied to the fuselose slide with the fighter was on the production line. The tactical number was the last two digits of the serial number. The numbers were usually applied in white and often had a thin end or brk outline and were usually of the same size and style. Some units in the field would regain the numbers altering the size, shape, or location.

Some La-5F's received a yellow winner and a yellow radar to avoid confusion with the German Focke Waller for 190, which was operated in growing numbers on the Eastern Front. In retrospect, this would seem to be a rather odd system since the German Lauftaw's Eastern Front theater recognition markings consisted of yellow moss, wing tips, fuselose bands, and raders.

## 6 Introduction

The first La-5FN (FN for _Forisovanny Negrorodersvenno_ [Directly Boosted]) left the State Aircraft Factory 21 in March of 1943 -- about the same time the La-5Fs were being delivered to the Fisher Aviation Regimes. The La-5FN is generally considered to be a parallel development of the La-5F rather than its successor.

The La-5FN was powered by an 1850 hp Ash-82FN engine that developed almost 150 more improvement than the Ash-82F. The Ash-82FN was a further development of the earlier ASB-82F. The power increase, which could be maintained for up to ten minutes, was the result of replacing the endrouters with direct fuel injection. Late production La-5FNs were equipped with the Ash-82FN powerful. The engine was still fixed at 1850 hp, but offered improved performance at high altitudes. The Ash-82FN engine could be started using compressed air from an internal pressure bottle or using a Hucks-starter dog on the propeller spinner.

The production La-5FN differed from the La-5F in a number of ways. The La-5FN received a long supercharger intake run on top of the cowt to support the deeper breathing ash-82FN engine. The new supercharger intake altered the cowting's supercharger and the two reinsting busches on each side of the cowt were deleted. The La-5 and La-5F had the engine exhausts ganged into a single pico on each side of the fuselage. On the La-5FN, the pipes were split into seven separate outlets in a fashion similar to that of the German BWM 801 engine used on the view 190A. The smaller diameters pipes were covered by a single flat plate. Three small lowvers were cut into the rear of the exhaust shield to vent the engine accessory and cannot compartments. Late production La-5FNs were equipped with a small circular hatch on the downward magnetic engines access doors.

All production La-5FNs were equipped with an additional duration Intensive side panel under the cockpit area. These fieselage able panels were not present on the La-5FN prototype.

Early La-5FNs used the radio antenna configuration of the La-5F. The aerial array consisted of a single wire running from the fuselage to the antenna sub on the tail and then to the slant- and tank behind the cockpit, Most production La-5FNs, however, reverted to the antenna configuration used on the earlier La-5 with two wires running from the antenna mast to the aerial stub and a small wire lead running from the same into the fieselage. Late production batches of the La-5FN introduced a further revision to the radio antennas. These aircraft deleted the head and run the antenna directly from the vertical fin into the starboard side of the rear canopy glazing. A few aircraft had the wire fitted on the rear of the rear canopy glazing. The first production La-5FNs were equipped with an RSI-radio, but this was later channel to the modified RSI-4kNF radio.

Most of the La-5FNs also received thickar rampy mass. The first production batches retained the 55mm (2.1 inches) thick mirror glass behind the windscreen, but this was changed to 57mm (2.2 inches) on later aircraft. The armor glass behind the pilot was increased from 66mm to 68mm (2.5 to 2 inches) as La-5FN production progressed. Some La-5FN returning from periads were equipped with an additional vertical frame on the at-s-sliding canopy. Later production batches of the La-5FN added a small graph handle to the port side of the outer canopy frame.

In April of 1943 the La-5FN prototype was tested together with a production La-5F at the Scientific Research Institute in Superflox. The introduction of fuel injection greatly improved the fighter's performance. Top speed at sea level was 595 kmh (369 mph), 38 kmh (23.6 mph) more than the La-5F. Top speed of the La-5FN was 648 kmh (402 mph) at 6300 meters (20,669 feet), a remarkable 58 kmh (36 mph) higher than the La-5F. The climb rate was reduced to 4.7 minutes to reach 5000 meters versus the La-5F's rate of 5.5 minutes to reach the same altitude.

La-5FN sentence in the Soviet Union. The Germans, however, felt that the aircraft displayed good flight characteristics through all phases of flight. Only at high driving speeds -- some pilots reached speeds up 720 km (447 mph) -- and the controls exhibit any stiffness. Additional testing demonstrated that the La-5FN was an excellent low-to-medium altitude fighter at 4 was particularly suited to a close-in, high-\(\beta_{\rm c}\), numerous style of combat. Additionally, the La-5FN had a better rate of climb than its German opponents up to an altitude of 3000 meters (9842 feet).

Shortly after the production of the La-5FN began a weight swap program was initiated in order to improve performance. The Lav Lavonia Design Bureau decided to replace some wood-en parts with light alloy metal parts. Metal wing bars, first introduced toward the end of the La-5FN production run, were standardized on the La-5FN fighter with a weight swings of 172 kg (379 lb). The first La-5FN were equipped with three wing tanks, but these were replaced by a series of four tanks in the figures with metal squared wings. A fifth, smaller tank was installed behind the engine. La-5FN continued to use cooled exhaust gases detected into the fuel tanks as a fire suppression system.

Despite the increase in float, the La-5FN's range was reduced due to the engine's greater fuel consumption. Combut mission flight duration was limited to only 40 minutes, but during forty flights with only 1600 RPM the endurance was 2 hours and 34 minutes.

A reduction of control stock forces was attained by embedded aerodynamic and static compensation of the control surfaces. These provided a considerable improvement in handling and maneuverability.

The La-5FN also deleted the single large exhaust stack and introduced multiple stacks covered by a movable flat panel. The "f of the two digit tactical number is slightly larger than the "f". (Nigel A. Eastaway)The fuselage was built in two major subassemblies. The rear section was an assembly of 13 bulkheads and four longressors covered by a skin made of fuselide wood. The thickness of the plywood varied from eight layers (9.5nm\(\lambda\)73 inch) at the cockpit to five (4.5nm\(\lambda\)71 inch) layers at the tail section. The plywood skin was an integral part of the fuselage structure and, with the longressors and bulkheads, formed the semi-monocourse construction.

The front fuselage section included the welded steel tubular engine frame which was connected to fuselage structure by massive wooden beams blended into the fuselage longerons. This structure carried the actual engine mounts, ammunition houses, fuel and oil tanks. The entire front fuselage section was covered by detachable or hinged metal panels.

The pilot's canopy frame consisted of metal tubing with a sliding center section that could be jeditioned in an emergency. The canopy could be locked in three positions -- open, closed, and a mid position for ventilation. The adjustable seat was made of dual sheet and tubes and designed to be used with a seat-rock type branching. A piece of 10mm (3.9 inch) thick mirror plate protected the plight from the rear. On their traject proton labels of the La-5/FN, the thickness of the steel armwork was reduced to 7mm (2.27 inch). The space behind the seat was accustomed by an RSI-4kNF radio, battery, oxygen bottle, and the hydraulic and pneumatic systems.

The cockpit was not equipped with a heating system.

The landing gear and its hydrostatic retraction system were unchanged from the earlier variants, however, the tail wheel rotation system proved to be troublesome and was often disconnected in the field. The aircraft was often flown with the tail wheel locked in the down position.

The La-5/FN retained the La-5/FN's ammanent of two mouse mounted 20 mm ShV/AK Camons with 200 mouts per mug. The guns could be charged both bouth semantically or mechanically.

Each wing contained provisions for a bomb rack for carrying bombs up to 100kg (220 lbs). The bomb release was placed under strawberry very low on the left hand side of the seat. The pilot was forced to bend over to reach it at a point when his full attention should have been devoted to flying the aircraft and hitting the target. Despite the provision for bomb racks, the La-5/FN was seldom used for ground support duties. Aside from being vulnerable to ground for the bomb release mechanism was unreliable and it was a common occurrence to have one or both bombs hang up on the rack.

La-5/FNs were delivered in the now standard scheme of dark grey and medium grey-green. For the most part, the camohage, national insignia, and tactical markings were identical to those on the La-5/F. A few La-5/FNs were delivered with a three digit tactical number, but this was rare. Additionally, some aircraft were known to have one of the two digits in the tactical number painted out. Most La-5/FN fibers had a white Fortisavtionary Nerogradestvenno (Directly boosted) logo on both sides of the engine cowling and tail fin. While the Fortisavtionary (Boston) logo for the La-5/FN was round, the F8/10 was diamond-shaped.

The La-5/FN saw comfort for the first time during OPERATION CITADEL, the German offensive around Kurks during the summer of 1943. The arrival of the La-5/FN in front from site-service was a very unpleasant surprise for the Luff

was it was simply obsolete and had been replaced by newer variants of the La-7. Additionally, jet aircraft were also beginning to make themselves felt. Perhaps the greatest reason had to do with the speed at which they were produced. The wooden airfame was simply not designed for a long term. The La-5 was developed in conditions of total war, and is calculated combat life was shorter than its mechanical life. As a result the La-5's wooden components were not treated with chemicals designed to inhibit rot. Rot and wood fungi began to damage the wooden parts of the aircraft making them unsafe to fly over a long period of time.

La-5FNs in Foreign Service

On 31 January 1944 twenty highly experienced Czechnovskaian fighter pilots and one ground staff officer were discharged from the British Royal Air Force and transferred to the Soviet Union. The pilots had been serving in the RAF since the summer of 1940 and were to form the nucleus of an independent Czechnovska fighter regimen with the command struc- of the Soviet Air Force. The men arrived in Moscow in early April of 1944 and were assigned to the GR Reserve Aviation Brigade at Ivanov aircraft approximately 300 km (185 inches) northeast of Moscow. Their aircraft, 24 brand-new La-5NFs were shown in front State Aircraft Factory 381 at Yaroslav in 3 April 1944. The aircraft were banged on the airfield until the weather became more favorable for the first training flights.

When the training course started on 3 May 1944 each Czechnovska pilot fleve five 30 minute flights in an La-5UTI. They were then considered ready to solo in their La-5FNs, During the training course, the twenty Czechnovska air were augmented by two Slovakia blades, Master Agreement Manager Mantsov and first Sergeant Laovitch Dokrovsky, who had detected with EMI to 1904-649 m upstream 95enter 1943.

On 18 May 1944 the Czechnovska pilots transferred from Ivanov airfield to Kubihara in the southwestern outskirts of Moscow where their conversion training was completed. Each pilot had accumulated 12 hours in the La-5NFs. The 1st Czechnovska Figure Regiment, as the unit was now designated, was ready to operations the front.

On 29 August 1944 the German began to occupy the territory of its unreliable Slovak alles from several directions. At the same time the Slovak Army, which had declared itself to be a set of the Czechnovska Army fighting alongside the Alties, began to resist the German inversions. By October of 1944 the instrument arms numbered approximately 50,000 troops and 70000 retinas. The small number air free was concentrated at TriDaby (Three Oaks) airfield, lying between Zolten and Bangka Bytsica. The area controlled by the insurgent army was completely surrounded by German forces and was a large, but isolated pocket deep inside German-held territory.

The commander of the insurgent army, General Jan Golian, requested assistance from the Russians. At the time the 1st Czechnovskar fighter Regiment was based on Prokary airflow airflow airflow, near Love (Lemberg) in the Ukraine and was part of the Soviet 2nd Air Army under the command of General Team Span A. Knoxships. The Czechnovsk pilots were directed to support the insurgents, on 17 September 14th the regimen, equipped with 21 La-5NFs flighters, landed at the newly Twin Zolten affield floor Zouchen. During the night the ground staff, fuel, and ammonia were referred in by Soviet Kilianov Lj-2 and Lendel-Leuse D Capels C-475.

During its operations the La-SFNs of the 1st Fighter Regiment had damaged a Messechrist BT 109 and a Focke Wulf Fw 190 and had lost two Lavochkins before the war ended.

Due to lack of La-SFN filters, the 2nd Fighter Regiment was only able to accomplish their training by using filters borrowed from the Soviet A1st Fighter Aviation Regiment based at Premyral. The war in Europe ended before the 2nd Fighter Regiment could be committed to combat.

After the war 31 Lavochkina La-SFNs and La-SUTs were incorporated into the inventory of the newly formed Czechowska Air Force (CAF), Czechovskai became the sole operator of the La-SFN outside of the Soviet Union.

In the CAF the La-SFNs were designated S-95 (S for _Silback_ [Figure]). These aircraft remained in use after the type had been withdrawn from Soviet service. The Soviet Union had guaranteed an affiner of its two years starting from the date of delivery from the factory. Any operational use of the aircraft beyond this limit required a thorough overall. Since the La-SFN had been withdrawn from Soviet service, however, the general overhaul and maintenance facilities to be longer existed in the Soviet Union. In only 1946 a commission of Soviet specialists declared all but two La-SFN non-inv and directed the aircraft be scrapped. This meant a massive loss of CAF fighter strength, especially since an order of 60 La-7's had not been filled.

We made group of Czechovskai Air Force and civilian specialists was tasked to examine the La-SFN safety question and they reached more favorable conclusion, only recommending a bank on an aerobits in some of the aircraft. Despite the group's recommendations, an La-SFN and La-SUTs will be subjected to a series of static tests of the Scientific Aviation Institute at Laumps. The results were not favorable as it was found that the tensile and bending strength of the payload was only 50 percent when compared to the original specifications. All of the CAF Lavochkins were promoted on 13 December 1946.

A further study by the Scientific Aviation Institute revealed that the poor quality of the payload had already been calculated into the affine static equations. The design had even cleared for maintaining the fighter's surroundings while the fuselge shell was slightly damaged. Structural defects discovered in the fuselge and the tail sectors were caused by the unsuccessarily still full steel shock absorbers which transmitted too many funding forces to the tail structure, especially during hard lundings. These discoveries confirmed the great care expended by the Lavochkina Design Bureau to produce a durable affine -- even when using poor quality materials and built under crude conditions in relocated factories.

The conclusions made by the Scientific Aviation Institute permitted the reinstination of the La-SFN at the La-SFN at the La-SFN at some during 1979. By 1 July 1948 the Czechovskai Air Force had 23 La-SFN and La-SUTs' aircraft on strength. By the end of 1948, however, most La-SFNs and reached the end of their life and were gradually withdrawn from service use.

The Czechovskai La-SFN's upper surfaces were prompted overall green grey, while the under surfaces were painted in light blue. The Czechovskai Air Force insignignal consisted of a large red, white, and blue trisected disk outlined in white. The insignal was applied to the vertical fan and the upper and lower wing surfaces. A first, the aircraft retained their two-digit white tactical number on the fuselge, but these were gradually replaced by a black three digitizer code on the fuselge and the wing under surfaces.

The La-5FN was the first Soviet fighter with performance that was superior to the Messerschmitt BT 1009. The Shrestov design team, however, realized that the advantage would be short-lived. They also came to the conclusion that it was not possible to increase the power of the ASB-82FN engine much beyond the 1850 bp the powerful already provided. Additionally, there were no other radial engines in development that hold the promise of super-information for the ASB-82FN. For a brief time the 220 bp ASB-71F engine had been regarded a potential successor, but the engine proved to be so unreliable that its use was out of the question.

The only viable alternatives to a new engine were not availed weight reductions and careful refinements of the La-5FN's aerodynamics. The weight reduction program, replaying wooden parts with high metal alloy parts, was largely accomplished on the production line beginning with late production L-5F and continuing through the production of the La-5FN.

By 1943 La-5 had already undergone a series of tests in the Inge-T-104 wind tunnel at the Central Aero Hydrodynamics Institute (TxAGI) in Zhokovsky. The tests revealed that simply sealing the gaps in the airframe would gain an additional 24 km (14.9 m) in speed. Further tests indicated another kind (5.7 m) would be available for the time which weels our request covered. Another test released the oil cooler from under the nose to a position underneath the fuselage. Parsatic drag was reduced by 50 percent while the flow of air through the cooler was increased by 35 percent.

The results were impressive enough to warrant further testing on a standard production

The La-5 '206' was the result of an attempt to institute aerodynamic refinements into the La-5FN design. As a result of extensive wind tunnel testing, changes were made to the spinper, engine cooling, supercharger intake trunking, oil cooler, and the radio antenna arrangement. Although the La-5 '206' did not see operational service, many of the refinements were incorporated into the later La-7. (Yefim Gordon)

La-5FN (in 39 21 02 06). Aside from making the refinements noted above, the aircraft had its spinper enlarged and the Hucks started some eliminated. The aircraft, row known as the La-5 '206', also received a heavier, single piece cooling. The exhaust cover plates were reduced in size and squared of while the three small lowers at the rear of the exhaust shields were deleted.

The supercharger intake trunk flaring was moved to the underside of the cowling. This forced the location of the oil colder further at to a position under the freselage even with the wing trail: ingge. The oil cooler's housing was also slightly modified. The dwarf lentge side panels added to the La-5FN hees were deleted -- a measure that resulted in less drag. The fresh air intake in front of the canopy were deleted, as was the radio tunnel. The wire chambers now ran the leading of the overall fit on a pair of small bistces located behind the rear carrying flaring. A new mission wheel will bedew was added to the La-5 '206' which completely sealed the wheel well. This modification was resulted in less drag.

Between 16 December 1943 and 10 February 1944 the La-5 '206' was evaluated under the direction of N. V. Alamovi at the Flight Research Institute at Zhokovsky Air Base. The flight tests confirmed the calculations of the NaCl. The La-5 '206' had a step speed at sea level of 630 km (591 mph). At 6150 meters (2177 feet) the key speed rose to 684 km (425 mph) -- 50 km (13 mph) faster than a standard production La-5 '206', as a take of weight of 3445 kg (7954 bs), was approximately 150 kg (330 bs) heavier than a standard La-5FN.

Ultimately, none of the aerodynamic refinements were incorporated into production La-5FNs. The La-5 '206' program, however, provided a wealth of valuable data that aided in the development of future Soviet figures, most notably the upcoming La-7.

## La-5FN/La-5 '206' Development

La-5FNLavochkin La-5FN (Model 1944)

The La-5 '206" was a project under the control of the scientists of the Central Aero hydrodynamics Institute. Their goal had been to improve the aerodynamics of the La-5FN air-frame, but they did not look into the feasibility of incorporating the improvements into production filters. The Lavochkin Design Bureau, using shared research data, took over this portion of the project, During January of 1944 construction of a new variant, initially designated the La-5FN Model 1944, was completed by the Lavochkin Design Bureau at State Aircraft Factory 214 February-Noyrospec. Nearly all of the aerodynamic changes recommended by the TAGI were introduced. The aircraft served as a pattern aircraft for the La-7 project and only a single prototype was built.

The La-5FN Model 1944 introduced the standard winner of the La-5FN as well as the use of a radio mass to support the antenna wires, although the mast was slightly slimmer. The new locations of the oil of cooler and superbraster make were retained from the '206', but the superbraster intake trunk was only slightly modified. Most of the changes found on the La-5F '206' ultimately found their way into the La-7.

**The La-5FN Model 1944 represented an attempt to incorporate some of the aerodynamic improvements of the La-5 '206' into a production aircraft. The La-5FN Model 1944 reintroduced the standard winner and radio antenna arrangement of the La-5FN. The program was terminated in favor of the more highly refined La-7 (kwan Ivanov)**Lavochkin La-5 'M-71'

In early 1943, the Lavochkin Design Bureau began an alternative engine program for the La-5: Great hope was placed on the new Ash-71F (Fir for Forscurvanny [Boscowald]) twin row, air-cooled radial engine. The 22000 be engine was intended to replace the Ash-82FN engine with the La-5FN. With almost 350 h more than the Ash-82FN Powerband, the engine would dramatically improve the performance of the La-5FN.

The design of the Ash-71F had begun in 1940 by joining a pair of nine-cylinder M-63 engines to form a single 18-cylinder twin row radial engine with direct field inspection. Of interest, the M-63 was an improved copy of the American Wright Cyclone-1820 G-5 engine. With all of the engine moment accessories attached, the Ash-71F (replace 1856 3563 (also 18)).

The first example of the Ash-71 provided 2000 be able at off -- nearly twice the power of the Kilmow M-105 in-flight regions imaged to lower the La-63A and Yak-16 filters. At an altitude of 2600 meters (8530 feet) from the Ash-71 was rated at 1800 and it was 4265 meters (20,50 feet) from the engine was still developing a remarkable 1670 h. Nevertheless, seven freeing troubles delayed the engine's introduction into front free service and the first engines were not available until early 1942.

While still in development, an Ash-71 engine was installed into a prototype Polkinyrop 1-185 fighter in March of 1941, but the aircraft did not try until February of 1942. The 1-185 had been developed as a competitive design to the La-5FN and drew up to 6804 (1422) dump during the factory test trials. By January of 1943 the NXP decided that further development of the 1-185 should be postponed since it was clear that the La-5FN was better suited for the Soviet Air Force. Control evaluations using a number of 1-185 prototypes assigned to the 18th Gouver-Fighter Aviation Regiment on the Kalinin Front clearly demonstrated that the Ash-71 was mechanically unreliable. The 1-185 also used large quantities of durability in its airframe -- an alloy in short supply.

The development of the Ash-71F powered version of the La-5 was conducted in parallel with the La-5FN and Ash-82FN engine at the Lavochkin Design Bureau. The Ash-71F engine was **The La-5 ASD-71F was an attempt to incorporate a more powerful metal engine into the La-5F affframe. The larger, 22000 be, 18 cylinder Ash-71F engine required a lower cooling. The engine proved to be unreliable and the program was terminated.** (**wan Ivanov**) mounted into an La-5 airframe that had also been modified with some of the attributes of the La-5F, most notably the cut down rear fuselage and full canopy. Additionally, a number of the aerodynamic refinements tested on the La-5 2006 also found their way onto the La-5 Ash-71F airframe. These included the broad, single piece covering, the superbermerk on intake mounted under the nose, and the reduction of the oil cooler to the lower fuselage even with the using tailing edge. The La-5 ASD-71F also lacked the dual panels on the fuselage side and, at 831 meters (27.26 feet) long, was slightly shorter than the 8.67 meter (28.4 feet) long. The wings were unchanged, but the wheel wells were completely enclosed by flush fling floors. With a half-of-weight of 3.516 (37518), the Ash-71F powered prototype was 385 hg (788) heavier than the contemporary La-5FN.

The La-5 Ash-71F prototype was painted in the standard cambridge pattern of black-green and alive green upper surfaces over light blue lower surfaces with the national insiglina -- a red star with black edge -- applied on the rear fuselage, tail, and lower wing surfaces. For the La-5 Ash-71F took off for its magnetic fligh on 28 April 1943 -- only a few stars after the La-5FN prototype flow for the first time. Between late April and June of 1943 the aircraft was cut of the Scientific Research Institute of the Soviet Air Force at Serwick. In the mid figures were promising. The flighter had a stop speed at sea level of 612 nm (380 mph) and a speed of 858 (425 m) at 4500 m m each (1084 feet). The speeds were 50 kmh and 37 kmh (31 and 22.9 mph) higher than those of the Ash-82FN powered La-5 However, the overall performance of the Ash-71F powered prototype did not meet the expectations of the Lavochkin Design Bureau and the NXP. It was then decided to take the La-5 Ash-71F to Central Aero Hydrodynamics Institute (SAf3) where it was tested in the full scale T-104 with the commande parallel. The cambridge pair was stripped off the airframe for these tests.

The root cause of the performance deficiency was found in the poor production finish, particularly in the engine covering, which caused the aerodynamic drag to be farter than expected. The engineers in the TAGG concluded that once the corrective measures where introduced, the La-5 with the Ash-71F engine could attain a maximum speed of about 720 kmh (447 mph).

The aircraft still failed to prove itself, however, due to the unreliable engine. It soon became clear that the Ash-71F would never enter full scale production because its shortcomings would never be completely solved by the Shevors Design Bureau. Further development of the La-5 Ash-71F was terminated. Only a limited number of Ash-71 engines were built and these were used experimentally in Polkinyrop and Lavochkin figures.

With La-5 Ash-71F testing at a dead, the reliable Ash-82FN was chosen as the standard twin-row radial engine of the Soviet Air Force's fighters and bombers -- a position it held until the end of the Great Particle War.

## Lavochkin La-7

During the fall of 1943 it became clear to Acradiy D. Shvetov and his design team that it was not possible to increase the power of the Ash-S2FN engine beyond its current output of 1850 hp. Additionally there were no other reliable radial engines of superior performance to La-SrSr. For a time the 2200 hp 038-Ti7 was regarded as a promising alternative, however, test with an Ash-71F equipped La-5 revealed the Ash-71F to be so unreliable that its use was out of the question.

As a result only two alternatives remained for the Lavochkin Design Bureau -- a further weight reduction and a careful aerodynamic improvement of the La-Sr- NEW weight reduction offers were performed on the production line by exchanging certain wooden parts with the light metal parts, however, there were no aerodynamic refinements made to the La-SrSr. Instead, the refinements were made to have version of the basic La-5A estimate designed the La-7. These improvements had been tested on the earlier La-5FN and La-5-20%, of which had been tested in a wind tunnel by the Central Area Hydrodynamics Institute (SAGI) at Zuorkovsky. Many of the aerodynamic refinements tested and finalized on the La-5-20% accuracy introduced on the La-7 prototype. In that regard, the La-5-20% can be considered the 2-7 prototype.

Scorgnor Mihailovich Alexeyev, the deputy designer at the Lavochkin Design Bureau, took control of the La-7 project since Lavochkin remained in Moscow. The first purpose-built La-7 prototype was completed in January of 1944, Mott of the aerodynamic changes recompiling by the TsaM experiment were incorporated into the prototype's airframe including, at first, the sealing of airframe and coating gaps both inside and outside the aircraft.

The start edge was removed from the La-7s isomer on the prototype and all subsequent production versions. The La-7s isomer was also more pointed. The Ash-82FN engine turned an new VISH-103V-4 project which replaced the Vis-103V Doppler of the La-5-Sr. The engine of cooler was moved from below the cost to a position under the fuselge even with the wing trailing edge. The long superbermayer intake on top of the court was removed and replaced by a fish intake in the leading edge of both wing roots. The exhaust outlet cover panel was slightly revised, being both smaller and having a slightly different shape.

**The second La-7 prototype reintroduced the antenna mast and aerial stub. The aircraft table features the revised main gear doors, but still lacks doors over the tail wheel well. (van Ivanov)**

The wheel wells were fitted with rectangular doors, however, these were later changed to a triangular shape on the production models. The prototype also shared the same main pair start two as the La-SrSr, but these were later revised to completely smooth doors on production aircraft. The main gear starts were also lengthened by 80mm (3 inches) compared to the La-SrSr.

The fresh air injects from front of the La-SF and FN canopies were deleted. The cockpit layout was revised and the instrument panel was changed, although the separation look of the La-SrSr as cyclic remained. The La-7s will lacked an artificial nitrogen gauge. Whereas the La-SrSr used a space occupied stick, the La-7-used a stick similar to the American filginess -- a direct copy of tube supplied by the US to the USSR under Lead-Lease. Additionally, refinements to elevators resulted in reduced costric forces.

The La-7 prototype lacked the radio antenna mast and aerial stub on the vertical fan, a design element on the La-5-20%; but production straecily created an on the La-5-20%. The work presented in this paper was slightly simmer than the mast used on the La-5-Sr.

On February 1944 test split to G. Shivayay began the La-7 prototype's flight test program and the results proved to be encouraging. A maximum beam of 597 per/min (371 mph) was recorded at sea level. This was remarkably superior to the La-5FN's speed of 546 kmh (339 mph) and the Fock Wall Fw-100A-83 speed of 560 kmh (347 mph) at the same altitude.

Two weeks like on 16 February 1944, the La-7 prototype was handled over for State Acceptance Trials. The trials, however, were not without incident. On 20 February 1944 test flight Major Kobyloshia experienced an inflight engine failure when an aging coinciding rod failed and he was forced to make an emergency landing. By 8 March 1944 the engine had been repaired and the testing program was continued.

The start edge was removed from the La-7s isomer on the prototype and all subsequent production versions. The La-7s isomer was also more pointed. The ASR-82FN engine turned an new VISH-103V-4 project which replaced the Vis-103V-103V Doppler of the La-5-Sr. The engine of cooler was moved from below the cost to a position under the fuselge even when with the wing trailing edge. The long superbermayer intake on top of the court was removed and replaced by a fish intake in the leading edge of both wing roots. The exhaust outlet cover panel was slightly revised, being both smaller and having a slightly different shape.

This was remarkably superior to the La-5FN's speed of 546 kmh (339 mph) and the Fock Wall Fw-100A-83 speed of 560 kmh (347 mph) at the same altitude.

Two weeks like on 16 February 1944, the La-7 prototype was handled over for State Acceptance Trials. The trials, however, were not without incident. On 20 February 1944 test flight Major Kobyloshia experienced an inflight engine failure when an aging coinciding rod failed and he was forced to make an emergency landing. By 8 March 1944 the engine had been repaired and the testing program was continued.

The start edge was removed by 22 March 1944 when the aircraft suffered a complete failure of the number 12 bulkhead in the art of fuselge while taxiing. The failure was traced to the absence of resin bonding in the joints -- a defect that was attributed to poor, and perhaps hasted, assembly. Once again the plc's skills prevented the aircraft from suffering far-ther damage.

While the first La-7 prototype was being evaluated, a second prototype was completed and became available for additional tests. This aircraft was equipped with a fuselge mounted **An early production La-7s is still equipped with the old antenna configuration adopted from the La-SrSr. The wire lead ran from the antenna mast to the rear starboard side of the canopy. (van Ivanov)**radio must and an aerial stub on the vertical fin. Additionally, the shape of the main wheel doors was revised and the two busters on the doors were deleted leaving the entire door flush and with the wing's lower surface. The second airfame also lacked well wheel doors. Apart from these changes, and a more conical shape to the spinner, the second prototype was virtually identical to the first.

Despite the the short therm difficulties faced during the La-7 evaluation, the acceptance trials were successfully completed on 27 March 1944. In this flight report Major Kubyshira stated that compared with the standard La-5FN, the La-7's rate of climb had improved considerably, maximum speed of 680 khn (422 mph) at an altitude of 6000 meters (19,685 feet) was recorded with the La-7 prototype -- at the time the best performance for a spoit fighter. However, the dramatic rise in performance was gained at a cost. At maximum power the coorbit temperature rose to 40\({}^{\circ}\) Celusus (10\({}^{\circ}\) Farineh) even while operating in the bitter end of the Russian winter. The temperature rise was caused by the elimination of the coorbit airfines and poor thermal insulation between the coorbit and engine wing. The situation was worsened by the hot oil lines running between the coil cooler and the engine and passing directly beneath the plud's feet. Additionally, poor internal sealing allowed uskeep sense to enter the occupied parts of the pilots reported the odor exhaust gases and burning rubber in the coorbit. The lack of proper ventilation also increased the condensation in the coorbit. Test pilots also complained about excessive under pedal forces and the absence of an emergency canopy release. These poor operating conditions, even in normal flight, could lead to greatly increased pilot fatigue and a higher accident and combat loads rate.

The list of complaints over the La-7 prototype was long. In addition to poor ventilation, high rader cold forces, and lack of an emergency canopy release, commission were made about the lack of a single control to engine speed and people pitch, an automatic supercharger or control, and a new cow trip found system. Such devices were already in use on Germany. For 190 where a single lever controller engine speed and propeller pitch, in the La-7-pilot had to make up to eight separate movements to properly control engine speed, propeller pitch, and supercharger board -- actions often difficult to accomplish in combat.

**A Production La-7 (the 50) was tested at the Scientific Research Institute during 1944. This aircraft carries the standard La-7' canoquage of grey and grey-green upper surfaces over light blue under surfaces. The tactical number is thinly outlined in red. (Nigel A. Eastaway/BART)**

Regrettably, of the long list of complaints, only two -- the automatic propeller pitch change mechanism and a jet/tight canopy -- were incorporated into the production La-7. The new fighter was to be pushed into combat as soon as possible.

Production La-7's differed little from the prototype and shared many similarities with the La-5' 206. Additional biased panels were incorporated into the cowling to facilitate maintenance. Whereas the La-5FN used a metal blocking strip wrapped around the top half of the rear covd section, the La-7 had shape wrapped completely around the rear covd. The three low-Aven as the rear of the exhaust sheet were retrained from the La-5FN, but these weaker smaller. Along the fuselose sides the La-7 received an enlarged, rectangular dwarf panel versus the triangular type used on the La-5FN. The dural wing root filter was also strengthened and enlarged on the La-7-Aven.

Early La-7's and read antones must and aerial arrangement similar to the later production La-5FN. Most La-7's, however, slightly altered the arrangement where the wire are from the most into the fuselose. The La-7's also used a mast of smaller cross-section that was not slant-of forward on the La-5's. A few 4-7's were delivered with a slightly lower start. After the end of the Great Flavor multiplier of La-7's were equipped with a single compass. A direction finding loop was placed on top of the fuselose behind the antenna mast.

Most La-7's and the 20mm SNV Ark connections with 2000 ports per gm and PP-1B spin spin. The sent energies were developed through circular apertures below the fuselose. The last La-7's production batches were equipped with three-20mm Berezi B-20 cmounts, a newly designed weapon that entered the Soviet Air Force Inveriner in 1945. The pins were symmetrically mounted with two on the port side of the upper fuselose and one on the standard side. La-7's equipped with the B-20 cmounts had three top rectangular bridges over the weapons while the SWAK cannot equipped aircraft a bar of tear-drop shaped farings to cover the gun's bunches. The B-20 cmoun weighed only 25 kg (55 hrs) was compared to the 42 kg (908 h) of a single SWAK 20mm custom.

The ccqft of the L4-7 was captured by western standards. Warting La-7s received an artificial horizon which hindered flying in poor weather and darkness. The post-war Cached Air Force added additional instrumentation to their La-7s. (Harry Wisch)

The La-7 was equipped with the PBP-1B (Prized dyna Bombomdeniya S Pikrovanya [Bomb Sight for Two Bombompland gun sight. The PBP-1B was a rather rudimentary reflector sight with two deflection rings: one for 200 km (124 mph) and one for 300 km (168 mph). It was unable to provide any fine degree of deflection that often required fitting in front or, through, and behind the target to ensure hits. (Harry Wisch)

The La-4s series and La-7s were usually armed with a pair of 20mm ShvAX cannon with 200 rounds per gun stored in removable boxes. On the La-7 spent cartridges were elect-ed through circular apertures below the tuselage. The small rectangular exhaust stack cover was a standard feature of the La-7. The La-7sN used a larger cover for the clustered exhaust stubs. (Vidamini Danda)

Not all La-7s produced were sent to the Fisher Aviation Regiments. During December of 1944, a number of La-7 production batches from the State Aircraft Factory 21 at Nizhny-Norwood were found to have defetive using structures making them prone to shedding their wings in a drive. The defect was traced to manufacturing faults in the metal spurs. Large numbers of the defective La-7s were from to Lvov (Lember) ajrildified and covered with white lenses where they awaited field modifications to correct the fault.

During 1944 a total of 1782 La-7s were produced of which 1529 aircraft were delivered to the front. Between January and April of 1945 a further 2915-8s were built and 1913 of these were sent to the front-fire lighter regiments. An additional 1928 La-7s were produced from May to December of 1945. A total of 5098 La-7s led the State Aircraft Factories before motion came to a halt in December of 1945. Most of the La-7s were produced at GZ-21 at Nizhny-Norwood. A number of these La-7s, and a small white Cylinci _import Workers of Georgia_'s painted on the portal side of the fuselge behind the canopy glazing. Additional La-7s were manufactured at GZ-94's up to the end of GZ-318 at Yavnikov.

The La-7s was by far the most outstanding radial engined fighter in the Soviet Air Force inventory during W1. Together with the Yaakovic Ya-3 and Na-9P; it was superior to the Focke Wulf 190s and the Messestment BI 1906-10s operating on the Eastern Front. The success of the La-7s was based not only on its design, but was also the result of improved Soviet pit during the same second of the Great Patriotar War, white at the same time the skill levels of the Lufferffer's fighter pilots fell into sharp decline.

Like the La-5s, the La-7d did not last to In Soviet service since the aircraft had been under the assumption that is combat it would be shorter than its airframe life. The airframe was supposed to last three years if kept in hanguars. War-time production has omitted anist-fungal treatments of the wood. In the colder northern chimes this was not a problem, but aircraft in the warm and humid southern and eastern parts of the USSR suffered greatly. There was one instance of an in La-7s Regiment being sent to the far East during the fall of 1945 and having all of its sixestest being struck off charge due to airframe deterioration before flying a single strike.

After the war the need for such highly designed and built aircraft diminished rapidly. A shortage of dual and other light allows were also a thing of the past and all-metal aircraft aircraft the order of the day. The La-7s was seen being replaced by more advanced fighters (including jets), and every night 1947, the wooden fighters had been completely withdrawn from the inventory of the Soviet Air Force.

Most La-7s were delivered in a cambridge and markings scheme that was virtually identical to La-7s. After the warner a number of La-7s were delivered with the upper surfaces in an overall grey-green or night before scheme while the under surfaces remained light before La-7s also used the same type of national markings and tactical numbers as the La-7s although some regiments overhanged the factory tactical numbers on their La-7s and repainted the numbers in a smaller size.

The La-7s\({}_{20}-\)a yellow disc with a red Cylinci La-7' -- was often painted on both sides of the engine coming and the tail. The yellow disk was outlined in red. Not all La-7s carried the logo since it was either not applied at the factory or was overspointed in the field. Front-line regiments sometimes applied local recognition markings to the aircraft in the form of white, red, or blue spinners. Yellow was seldom used because it was used as a theater recognition marking by the Germans and their airlines flying on the Eastern Front.

## Czechoslovak La-7s

Onside the Soviet Union, only Czechoslovakia operated the La-7 fighter. In late March of 1945 the first eight La-7s were delivered to the 2nd Czechoslovak Fighter Regiment at Balice Airfield near Krakow, Poland. During April of 1945 another 64 La-7s were delivered to the 1st and 2nd Czechoskiak Fighter Regiments. These aircraft were too late to see combat some the war in Europe ended on May 1945. Most of the Czech Laevschosakia carried the standard Soviet Air Force commande and markings, but the La-7s of the 1st Czechoslovak Fighter Regiment had a larger red arrow with a white amplitude painted on the engine cowling. The spinter was painted in white, blue, and red -- the national colors of Czechoslovakia.

Cecchoslovakia eventually received a total of 56 La-7s. In Czech service the fighters were 56-97 (57 _for Sikonka_ [Fighter]). Soviet cambridge and tactical numbers were retained on the aircraft, but the Soviet national marking were replaced by Czech national fire. Later the Czechlovak's have seen a new cambridge scheme of overall brown-green winders and pale blue under surfaces. The original Soviet two-digit incumbent numbers was replaced by a four character letter oade that was painted in white on the rear fuselge. Occasionally the number was repeated in black on the wing under surfaces.

The majority of the Czech La-7s were equipped with the two 20nm SWAVACs, however. A few were received with the heavier arrangement of the 20nm B-20 cmons. These aircraft were also equipped with a direction finding loop behind the radio mosa. Most of the La-7s were allocated to the Czech Atk Division which had its bases in the Slovanian (eastern part of the country. The aircraft were believed in order to protect them from the raynest of the climate for as long as possible.

At the same time a Soviet scan of specialists was examining the La-5sNs in Czech service during 1946, the newer La-7s were also under scrutiny. Although La-7s in Soviet service were based on it early 1947, the fighters soldiers on in the Czech Air Force until 1950 making Exchoslovakia the longest operator of the Lavrochka La-7 fighter.

La-7 Front Fuselage Development

## La-7TK

Shortly after the first La-7s left the State Aircraft Factories during May of 1944, a project was initiated to improve the fighter's high altitude performance. The project involved fitting a new supergranter to the Shvetsov radial engine. The experimental Lavochkin fighter received the designation La-7TK.

A production line-7 was equipped with a TK-3 supergranter on each side. The TK-3 supergranter was developed by the Central Area Engine Institute (TIAM). The idea of equipping Soviet figures with supercharges was not entirely new. During late 1939 a single 1-153V (Visport) [High Attfield] bijnden had been equipped with a pair of TK-3 supergranters in order to improve the service ceiling and climbing capabilities of the original 1-153 design. Instead of La-7s V5ls-150 V-4peptide, the La-7TK recorded the VIS-105V propeller that the La-7-TK was also fitted with a quartz dog on the winner.

The outlet over panel was enlarged and a triangular flaring was added to each side of the engine owing. The flaring housed the exhaust of the TK-3 supergranter. The La-7TK was equipped with two outlet towers on the square shaped chistabitabit. The measurement of two 20mm Shvetsov was detected from the La-7TK prototype and the camera ports in the upper oct were fixed over. Additionally, the camera bored frings on the engine accessory by aucas panel were also deleted. The La-7TK carried the standard cammodage and national insisting for contemporary La-7 fighters, however, no tactical number was applied to the prototype.

The factory test flights of the La-7TK began in July of 1944 and lasted one month. The two T-3 supergranters enabled the La-7TK to climb to 11800 meters (56.0896 feet) which was 1000 meters (2380 feet) higher than the ceiling of La-7s. A top aspect of 676 kmh (420 mph) was accomplished at an altitude of 8000 kmh (26.246 feet). This was 21 kmh (13 mph) greater than the top speed of the production La-7.

Although the test results were favorable, the majority of aerial engactions on the Eastern Le-7TK was equipped with a pair of TK-3 supercharges -- one on each side of the twelagio. No ammanent was carried on the prototype. The tail wheel and propeller are missing. (ivan bran)

From were performed at altitudes between 1000 and 5000 meters (2380 - 16,404 feet). Consequently, the need for a high altitude fighter was of a relatively low priority. Additional testing also revealed that the T-3 supercharges were unreliable. Nevertheless, during the course of 1944 a batch of ten La-7TK figures were built. They were intended for operations against German high altitude reconnaissance aircraft and were armed with a single 20mm ShvAX cannot mounted on the port side of the fuselag.

La-7TK was equipped with a VISH-105V propeller and a starter dog instead of the VISH-105V-4 propeller without a starter dog used on the La-7. The two TK-3 supercharges gave the La-7TK a maximum ceiling of 11,800 meters (38,713 feet). (ivan bran)

## Lawochkin La-7R

During the summer of 1944 the first reports of the German Messerschmitt Me 262 jet fighter-ber-binder and the Arada Ar 234 jet bomber arrived at the Kremlin. The Soviet government fully understood that it had to intercept in the inventory that could stop the German jets. The Soviet High Command was particularly concerned that jet bombers would be used against the USSR, particularly in raids on Moscow.

As a countermeasure a rocket-powered variant of the La-7 fighter was developed during August 1944. Prior to profits given by cuts to the project and an RD-1 rocket motor was provided by a design team headed by Valentin Petrovich Glushko. During July of 1940 Glushko worked at the Reaction Motor Institute in Moscow and had presented a concept of an auxiliary rocket motor attached to piston enginel aircraft. The addition of a rocket motor could provide certain incident benefits such as speeding an intercept, allowing effective pursuit of an escaping energy aircraft, or allowing the fighter to escape superior enemy aircraft.

The rocket motor's development began in 1941 at the Experimental Design Bureau 16 at Kazan under the control of Glushko. The program received a boost when the leading Soviet rocket motor scientist, Sergey P. Kerovby, joined the staff. By 19 November 1942 Kozubov headed Group 5 of the Experimental Design Bureau 16 and had started work on RD-1 (RD-Radium Drygelat [Reaction Enginel]) auxiliary rocket motor. The first trials of the motor mounted on a modified Re-2RD bomb began to 1 October 1943, although there were some minor setbacks that delayed the program.

By the summer of 1944, production of the La-7 as the USSR's premier fighter was already underway. One example was chosen to test the RD-1KhZ rocket motor. The airframe and wings of an La-7 were heavily modified and the rocket motor attached to the fifteenth bulk-head adjacent to the vertical stabilizer. Its location required the raising of the horizontal tail surfaces as well as enlarging the surface area of both the vertical and horizontal tail surfaces. The rudder trim with was also enlarged. The fuselengues was lengthened by 80mm (3.14 inches) to 8.75 meters (28.7 feet).

The RD-1KhZ rocket engine was powered using a 90 liter (23.7 US gal) tank of kerosene and a 180 liter (47.5 US gal) tank of nitric acid placed in the fuselage. The nitric acid tank was made of stainless steel. The fuel capacity gave the rocket engine a thrust duration of 3.5 minutes. Special pumps driven by the ASB-82EN radial engine supplied the rocket motor with both fuel components.

The addition of the rocket motor and the fuel tanks shifted the center of gravity towards the tail. Consequently, it was necessary to add ballast to the engine mounts to bring the center of gravity to within acceptable limits. The supercharger intake allows us releaseed from the wing roots to the top of the oui in a manner similar to the La-5FMs. The wing root makes were lateropf. Additionally, insulation was added around the nitric acid tank to isolate it from the ASB-82EN's air induction system. Behind the canopy the radio mast and aerial stub on the vertical stabilizer were depleted. The antenna wire simply ran from the fit to a hole in the rear section of the canopy glaring. The La-7R also had the seat back and head armor removed in a further effort to save weight. (Theoretically, the armor was not needed since the La-7R could speed away from any threat behind it). The gross weight of the La-7R was 3490 kg (7694 lbs). This was 270 kg (595 lbs) more than the production La-7 fighters. The RD-1 rocket engine and its components alone weighted over 100 kg (220 lbs).

The La-7R carried the standard camouflage of contemporary Lavoshkin fibriters -- dark grey and medium grey-green upper surfaces with light blue under surfaces. The insignias were alsoidentical to those used on production La-7s, No tactical number was applied to the La-7s.

During the 1944 the La-7-R took off for the first time with test pilot G. M. Shivanov at the controls. The flight was of short duration since a malfunction in the fed supply occurred once the rocket engine was emitted. The design team was forced to spend additional time redesigning the fuel system. Eventually the fuel supply was placed into a pressure tank and, after some additional minor modifications the RD-1KlZ rocket motor worked flawlessly.

The RD-1KlZ rocket motor provided 3.5 minutes of boost at 300 s (66th lap) of thrust. During the flight tank, speeds up to 743 km/(641 km) were recorded -8 km km (54.6 mph) faster than standard La-7s. When the rocket motor was not operating, however, the system was simply dead straight that advected the preferred the performance, in particular the maneuverability, of the La-7s.

The experience and data gained during the trials of the first La-7s were used in the second experimental aircraft. In contrast to the first La-7s the second aircraft technic engine was ignited electrically. The second La-7s first fire in March of 1945. During the evaluation the aircraft technic speed of 795 km (494 mph) at 6300 meters (20.669 feet). During the flight the La-7s reached an altitude of 13,000 meters (42,650 feet) nearly 200 meters (650 feet) above the service ceiling of a production La-7. Further testing showed that the electric ignition system proved to be troublesome, especially at high altitudes. The electrical ignition system was detected in favor of a chemical ignition system.

Although the performance of the La-7s was promising, the operation of the RD-1KlZ rocket motor was extremely dangerous. Two meter employed live during test, one on the ground one on a test flight. During the test flight, pilot G. M. Shivanov succeeded in bringing the La-7s safety back to base, but with a considerable part of the control surfaces rinsing. Further testing demonstrated that, although mating a rocket engine onto the La-7s airframe was technically possible, it was unsuitable for service use. The end of the war also batched the end of the project as did the development of reliable (for the time) jet engines. The surviving La-7s was demonstrated to the public during the Tushino air display at Moscow on 19 August 1994. Its presence marked the end of the evolution of Russian fighters with mixed power sources. It was clear to both the Kremlin and Soviet Air Force that the future belonged to jet aircraft.

(Above) The L*-VTI had an additional instructive cockpit. The aircraft lacked an antenna mast. The tail wheel was locked down and the tail wheel does were deleted. The Soviet national marking was only applied to the rear fuselage and wing under surfaces. The silver bands on the nose are metal straps used to hold the cowling together. They were often left unpaired. (Ivan Ivanov)

(Below) This L*-VTI, originating in the Caucasus region, was from to Turkey by a Soviet detector. This was a production variant with the oil cooler placed in the front under the engine cowling. No tactical number was applied to this aircraft. (Heliz J. Nowarra)
