## Introduction

-jet Proposition: proposition of a body produced by the forevarded directed forces of the reaction resulting from the reward discharge from the body of a jet in this speed stream of fluid through a nozzle or orifice."

The theory of jet propulsion has been with a very long time since the second observation when there of Alexandro contact motion by straight and parallel with its supports by means of jets. But if a wasn't that the 1928a that the particle was applied to aircraft is in 1938. After Flight Flight Frank, written forth a thesis of the theory of reaction that is atopting to extend its targets, thus fed into the design, development and then testing of the whittle jet engine in 1937. But the British presentation had no interest in the jet engine at that time.

In Germany, Miller had revised the air arms and developed it to a scene edge. But the Garman Air Ministry also turned deaf ears on the jet engine. With this own mind, the flight behind, saw something inside the jet engine concept. With this own mind, and using an engine designed and developed a stream streamed toward the midway, well installed an air-frame and engine program that culminated in the flight of the recorded jets first peripted accident. After the flight, which he in 1938, powered by the NASA engine. Between the Heinzel developments and the infusion of young, forward discharge filters in the Lunar, the attitude of the Air Ministry changed. In 1938 and other was placed to develop the first jet propelled fighter aircraft - the Messerschmitt Me22.

In the United States, two companies had enough foresight to gamble on jet engine development - Lockheed and Northrop, Northrop was more interested in the turbiopiopios. Lockheed, also without government support, not only designed an engine of their own. The L+100- but also an affirmance to house it - the L+133. The complete L+133.400 package was proposed to the Army Air Corps in the Station of 1944. The L+100- engine was to have this thrust of any jet engine in the world. When installed in the L+133 air-frame, it promised a speed of 265 mB at 5000.000. The Army Air Corps turned down the proposal because 15, policy dictated that engines and airframes have separate manufacturers, and because the L+133, a stainless steel steel design, was "too material". At About this same time, an arm Chief of the Army Air Corps, General Hapold, found that in England, gas turbines that already been built and were almost ready to fly. With his insistance, the Army Air Corps decided to be ahead with development of an American aircraft. Due to the needed development of the Lockheed L+100 engine, the flight outside his place after the Station Station, it was decided to use the already developed British engine in a U.S. Airframe, General Electric world further develop the engine and Bell Aircraft. On would be the airframe. The result was the full-engine Bell P&S Aircom.

The two things came to pass which killed the P&S Aircom. The two things came to pass which killed the P&S Aircom as a jet fighter design. In the Fall of 1944 the P&S and its first flight and attained a speed of 0.044 mph, less than the speed of 0.936 mph. The second, and far more ominous, was the flight of the Me22 in july 1944. With improved jump 0004 and Qadir engines of 3960 hs, thrust each, the Me22 was expected to be 1090 mph. The Me22 was expected to drop production in June 1943. Continuation, it was in June 1943 that the Army Air Corps gave the goahead to Lockheed to build the P&S Aircom.

The p-80C was built in greater numbers than any other variant. Incorporating the \(333\)-\(23\) engine with \(4600\) bis. of thrust, the C's top speed rose to \(580\) mph. The p-80C was the first aircraft to use an explosive canopy remorer. Additionally, the wings were strengthened and added to hold the other reconcels or to two \(1000\) b. bombs. The p-80C was the true "Higher-bombier Shoring Star". In June 1948, all p-80C, indeed all flightery aircraft, were redesignated".

A large number of p-80Cs and \(88\) were rebuilt for \(60\)C standards.

This p-80C opened up for engine maintenance shows how the tail was designed to come out. Access to the engine was accelerated, and with the long baseline panel removed, as seen here, most of the engine accessories could be inspected and exercised without having to remove the engine from the aircraft. The flags of the p-80 were fairly large and extended back as well as down when they were extended. Note the redesigned cockl company-the integral antenna in the plexidless canopy can just be seen.

T-33A

Interest in a trainer version of a jet powered aircraft began at almost the same time as the original X-ray-object design. Insight into the fact that flying a jet aircraft would be vastly different from any pro-driven aircraft for local vehicles to push for development of a jet laminar. But Air Corps was no need for such an aircraft, and the fly did not want to satisfy any fighter arrangements on tainhers. Other methods for training jet pilots were later including the fixing to the ground of a standard F-00. In 1947, jet pitting called for 80 hours in the 16-70, 50 hours in P-80.

1.79 in 1947, 1wild: Shockwise's shungst almost finished twice to contact cancellations, the Air Force decided to imight a tube to use a two jet jet trainer. England already had one-force the MUT and France was working on one-axis, thus logical for the Air Force to let the contract to Lochead since they had been working on the ideas 1944. A cross-section for Air Force awarded a contract for 20 T-800 jet trainers in January 1948. The designation was later changed to T-33A.

The original trainer version was an F-00 (Image with a 20 inch section added forward of the shipped). Another 12 inch section was added forward of the rear fuselage for balance and stability. Additional differences between the p-800 and T-800 were smaller as 52 gallo fuselage but trails, nylon total cells, two 50 calime runs instead of six, improved air conditioning, and of course the additional seat and flight controls. Lockheed proposed a three piece side-opening canopy for the trainer but USAF insisted on the single claim-shell canopy so familiar on T-33A. If the need arose, the regular six-quin nose could be fitted to the T-33. Early T-33a were had the dual 1000 lb, bomb shackles on the wings. The Or-ly major change to the T-33 throughout the years was the addition of the Fletcher-type wingtip tanks. However, there were some T-33A fitted with the PF-00 nose and designated RT-33. These were all old to other nations. Almost 6,000 T-33a were built, including 649 for the US Navy (TV-28) and 1058 for foreign air forces.

The F-94C, originally designated F-94C, actually was on the drawing boards more than a year before the F-94C. But all the design changes, some incorporation into strategic support, then, but no production for ordering these areas. The F-94C was also used to construct good-term front noise to tailor. It had its all-offset manager wrapped around a new f-thister.

Protein plagued the layer development of the F-94C, Lockhead had promised delivery of a production F-94C in 1951. But this time the schedule could not be met. There were simply many unused items at time. Neither the engine or the lunar flux wing designed specifically for the F-94C would be ready on time. Testing the new fuel-tronics packages and argument systems was not even to start until 1951. Engine plans across and were not completely covered until we will not the production run, One gear is technically enough enough that that will then in case rockets were fired at once a f-thister frequently occurred.

But the problems were slowly rotted out and the F-94C were operational with the 43Th F-94C at 93A F-94C. If such 1951 may favor bypass behind Scheded Operation Hopp was a program that had many of the problems.

## Shooting Stars over Korea

When the Korean War broke out on June 25, 1950, Far East Air Force (FEAF) was called to secure the sites over South Korea. F40 Snooting Stars were the most prevalent after twelve available to FEAF, which had 365 F-80 s in the assigned total of 553 aircraft. The fifth Fughe, 331 Fughe, 439 Fughe, all with Fughe F-80 s and based in Japan, and the 51st Fughe aged at Niana, Onhaver, were all pressed into cotton covering the evacuation of 55.5 personnel from Korea.

It wasn't once until the F-80s drew first blood. On the afternoon of the second day of the war, 27 June, North Korean Yars attended to interrupt the evacuation at Kimpa, F40 s-100 s, the 55th Fughe, 879, were on outer over the base. When the first two sugar, about two minutes after it had begun, our Yars had been shut down with F-80s even.

In Capt, Barbon Schlieter and H.T. Robert Deeault each got one, while it, Robert Wayne shot shot down two. The 880,000 figure in World War 2, had finally been blocked.

The majority of F40 s-100s, however, were not to be the mirrors at superiority.

One, They were the air stopper missions needed to break the armored swearhead of the Communist arms, in the early going, inexperience with the F40 (some units had just transitioned into the aircraft) led to the conversion of some squarctions back to the F51D Nation. This was temporary, however, and most visits were back in their F-80s by 1951.

After the North Korenas closed the Pusan Perimeter, the F60s started operating from bases in Japan. This meant long flights in the ramped cockpit of an F-80. The typical mission from 8th F8WB pilots from Itzakov Air Base was two hours forty minutes long. And in 1951, some F-80 cores started flying "back to back" missions - morning tastogi, from Itzakov, by the mission to N. Koros, Iand, retrieval and reram at Tago, Koros, Jr. s.e., and confusion, land and retrieval again at Tago, then the flight home to Itzakov. It made for a full day of combat flying.

On November, 1950, there first let's-get all control took place in an area in northwest Korea later known as "MIG Alley". Several days prior to the fact that day, MiG 15 jets had been encountered by USAF F-510s on patrol near the Yaj River. Although no Mistang were lost, it was obvious that there were no match for the speed of MiG, FEAF courtesy the travel by increasing F-80 combat targets in the Yaj River era. On the afternoon of F40 s, November, 14, Russell Brown, 1619, Gutmuever has to attach ANG 15s, tracked onto the tail of one of them, and poured 50 caller fire into him until the MSG explosion. It was the first of 627 MiGs to be shut down in Korea and the first jet-rs-jet victory ever.

RFs over Korea

Photo reconnaissance played a vital part in the Korean War. And again the job felt to the F-80, RF-40s from the fifth TIWW view sterile after sortie deep into Mid Alley, trying to keep this on the Mid Activities north of the Yahia. It was easily the most hazardous of all F-80s. Future "Fiber", another another, and another until many (774) quintup into the HotS 65 out, the pilots of the 67th consortiumly bought the needed photo. Sometimes their aircraft were short to pieces of ready belt by centing "Gree" encountered trying to evade the MIS. But they came back in three years of combat flying any one RF-80 was lost in the other.

F-94s over Korea

Capt. Ben Filtan and U. Sam Lyons got the first F-94 full when they shot down a Yak 9 on the night of 30 Jan 1983. During the first four in Korea, the F-94s accounted for a enemy aircraft while loop up to one of the four. The two less occurred when an F-94s were right into the F-94s. During the second five years, the F-94s was wrong to intercept.

When the Korean War drew to a close on 27 July 1983, there were no F-94s in the sites. They had all been replaced by faster F-94s and F-94s further bothers. However, the sites turned to defend the tree world until the 1986s. F-94s remained on July 11 Kony could the last shot was fired. Lockheed's jt step-child; and Its descendants, had written a glorious page in the analysis of air warfare.
