## Introduction

The Republic Aircraft Company of Farmingdale, Long Island, New York was a major aircraft manufacturing company by the mid-20th Century. This firm built the P-47 Thunderbird fighter, which was service as a long-range secret fighter and as a fighter-bonner during World War Two. Republic entered the jet soap some after World War Two ended with the P-84 Thunderbird (redesignated F-84 in 1948). This straight-winged, single-engine fighter-bonner was delivered to United States Air Force (USAF) fighter-bonner units assigned to the newly-formed Tactical Air Command (TAC). The F-84E and F-84G variants was restrictive during the Korean War, providing support for US-to-United Nations (UN) troops. The straight-winged F-84 suffers further developed the swept-wing F-84Thunderstbird's fighter-bonner and the RF-84Thunderbird reconnaissance aircraft. The F-84F and RF-84F served with the USAR and Air National Guard (ANG), with the ANG rating its last examples during the early 1970s. F-84F and RF-84F was few well overall allied air forces from the mid-1950s up until until - with some countries - and early 1998.

By the early 1950s, F-84 production was winding down and Republic needed to pick up another aircraft program to continue its business with the USAF. The Air force did not have the funding for any kind of F-84 improvement study, so the company initiated in sou studies in the early 1950s. Republic Chief Engineer Alexander Kartwell, designer of the earlier P-47 and F-84, ran these studies. Republic titled its proposal AP-63 (Advanced Project) and it was written to meet the USAF's requirement for a new fighter-bonner. This aircraft would replace the F-84F and be capable of carrying technical nuclear weapons. AP-63 was originally proposed.

**Republic's first letter failure when the F-84 Thunderbird, which had straight wings and tail stages. It saw extensive action in the fighter-bonner role during the Korean War, the F-84G (51-821) flews with the 30th Fighter Escort Squadron, 31st Fighter Escort Wing in the early 1950s.

As a scaled up version of the RF-84F Thunderfish, with a length of 52 feet 3.6 inches (15.9 s) - 5 feet (1.5 s) longer than the RF-84F. This wave aircraft's wingening was 3 feet 8.4 inches (11.2 s) and its height was 17 feet 8.4 inches (5.4 s). The fighter-bonner was designed to have an all-metal structure derived from the other RF-84F. The AP-63 was to be powered by one 14.500 ground thrust Allison 771-A 7atheratheratheratheratherather. This was projected to give this aircraft a maximum speed of over 800 knots (921.2 mV/1482.5 mV at 35,000 feet (0,668 s).

An internal bomb bay is in the mid-fuselage was planned to hold two 1000 pound (453.60 x) conventional bombs or one 3400 pound (1542.2 x) nuclear weapon. Additionally, six 1000 pound weapons or one nuclear bomb could be carried under the wings. The AP-63 effective armament was four 60\(\,\)collect (15.280). The 15.280 m ceiling was mounted in the wing notes. Both pilot at a Republic-developed election set. But has enclosed by a three-piece windfall, a single-piece upward-going canopy, and two raw vision windows retained from the F-84F. Republic's engineers referred AP-63 by making 108 major design changes. These changes included powering the aircraft with two 71 engines, which would have increased its maximum speed to March 1. The finished AP-63 submission had its length increased to ten feet (3.0 \(\,\)to 62 feet (18.9 s). The wingening was reduced from 36 feet 8.4 inches to 35 feet (10.7 s). The wingening at the 45\({}^{\circ}\) sweep angle from the rear of RF-84F, but had a distance chord (width). Wing-mounted control surfaces included leading flag, upper wing positions in place of conventional cameras, and Fowler flaps on the trailing edge. The tail incorporated conventional vertical stabilizer and rudder and stabilators, which combined elevators and stabilizes in one movable surface.

The revised AF-63 proposal replaced the J71 engine with the new 23,000 pound thrust Part **The F-84F Thunderstands incorporated sweptup and all surfaces to a modified F-84G Tuselago. A channel canopy reduced the Thunderbird's off-opening bubble canopy.** This F-84F (52-6713) was assigned to the 77th Fighter Bomber Squadron, 20th Fighter Bomber Group at RAF Wethersfield, England in the 1950s. (RLL Ward via Manner)& Whitney YJ75-P-3 afterburning turbojet engine. Fixed geometry engine intels were located where the wing leading edge and fuselage met, while a variable exhaust outlet was fitted to the engine.

The internal weapons bay was revised to carry a single 2000 bound (007.2 x\(\alpha\)) conventional bomb, a 3400 bound per nuclear device, a 350 gallo (1324.9 d) tall tank. Four wires fitted under the wing to each carry up to 4000 pounds (1814.4 x\(\alpha\)) of ordinance or an external fuel tank. A fifth prism with a 2000 bound capability was located on the committee, under the weapons by. Defensive manner was changed from four 60 caliber T-130 machine guns on the wing roots to one 200m General Electric Te-1710 (later M61A1 Vulcan) six-barrel rotary common. This weapon was mounted on the port nose side and was supplied with 1028 rounds of ammonium. The rotary common's maximum firing rate was 6000 rounds per minute.

General Electric's new M6-like control system was common to both the original and revised AP-63 proposals. This system was installed in the nose, based of the occupied, It used a K-19-filled flight system, which was linked to an ANAP-31 radar engine for weapons aiming. The M-8s also incorporated the 23-A ranging medium in the nose and the 5-145 special (nuclear) stores weapons release system.

Republic projected the revised AP-63's performance to include a maximum speed of 765 s/m (1231.1 x\(\alpha\)) at 5000 feet. A simple concept of 33,000 feet (108.30 x\(\alpha\)) and a constant radius of 959 mutual millides (1104.31), and 1177.2 x\(\alpha\)x0. Its emission profile of one nuclear target achieving fuel tanks gave the aircraft a projected combat weight (its weight over the target) of 23.247 pounds (128.12 x\(\alpha\)). This range could be extended by in-flight feeding, using a retractable probe mounted on the port side of the nose in the front of the cockpit.

In February of 1952, Republic submitted the revised AP-63 to the USAR, which approved the proposal the months later in place of further F-84 production. That September, the USAR eventually ordered 199 aircraft, now officially designated the **F-108**. The Air Force Woops Board reviewed this request and recommended a reduced contract. The USAR awarded Republic a formal development and production contract for 45 F-105 aircraft in March of 1953. This included 36 F-105 nuclear strike fighters and nine **RF-105** reconnaissance aircraft.

## 6 DevelopmentF-105a

Republic's original AP-63 proposal was greatly modified to a more streamlined design for the F-105a. The nose was more pointed and incorporated a small cone enclosing the E-34 ranging radar antenna. The fuseluge was ship-sided from the cockpit area at to the engine exhaust. A small streak was mounted under the tail to provide additional stability. The sweep-back wise was mounted in the mid-fuseluge and was capable of supersonic speed. Four stainless steel posts formed the fat end of the engine exhaust and opened to serve as speed backes. The aircraft was also fitted with an arcasing box mounted in the lower atfuseluge. This book was used to engage a barrier ceiling across a short narrow.

Republic engineers built a mock up of the new F-105a at its Farmingdale, Long Island plant. The Arc Force inspected and approved this mock in October of 1953. The original order of 46 -105b is made in March of 1953 as well as for polyethylene powders to 15 YF-105s aircraft in February of 1953. In order to ensure that the system, only to be reinstated to 15 aircraft in February of 1953. This order included two **YF-105a**, six **F-105b** position fighter-bombers, and three **YF-105a**s. In June, the Air Force revised the order eliminating the four YF-105b and increasing the 105a of F-105b on top.

The YF-105a was 61 feet 1 inch long (18.6 \(\times\)0.3), with a wingason of 34 feet 11 inches (10.6 \(\times\)0.4) and a height of 17 feet 6 inches (53.3 \(\times\) 10.1 \(\times\) an all-metal structure, which used forged enceptions in high stress areas of the airframe. Six panels were mixed in thickness using machine milling, with other panels used where greater pressure was required and thinner as well as elsewhere. Republic's use of forging and machine milling was innovative in aircraft on construction at the time. The fully retucable landing gear consisted of a forward-retracting nose near in the forward fuseluge and inward-retracting main landing gear units in the wings. Each gear used a single wheel and tire.

The F-105a was originally designed to use one 220,000 normal thrust **P**ata & _Whitney_ \(J\)55-arthurning turbine utpied engine; however, this powerful was unavailable in 1953. Republic engirners redesign the YF-105a to use the 150,000 normal thrust **P**at & _Whitney_ \(J\)55-arthurning turbine utpied engine. Fixed elliptical nuts at the wing leading edge root supplied air for this Reynolds built two YF-105a (89rail numbers 54-0908 and 54-0909) at Farmingdale. The first aircraft (54-0908) was completed and shipped to Edwards Air Force Base (AFB). California for flight-testing. It first three from Edwards on 22 October 1955, with Republic's conflict test but Russell's Taylor's fault in the controls. Both broke the sound barrier on this 45 minute long flight, which handled safety at Edwards.

On 16 December 1955, the first YF-105a was making a 5.5 \(\times\) 5 \(G\) turn at over 550 knots (633.3 \(\times\) 0.19/10.2 \(\times\) 0.80) when the strawford main landing gear is underwendary deployed. The slipstream tree hole the garden of the aircraft and forced Rott to make a highly landing on the Edwards day back. This flag changed extensive structural damage to the YF-105a's at the fuseluge. Its turn returned to the Republic factory for repairs, plus the damper was judged too extensive for economic repair and the aircraft was permanently grounded. The initial YF-105a (communabled 22 flight hours in 28 29 flights.

Flight tests continued with the second YF-105a (54-0099), which first few on 28 January 1956. This aircraft offered from the first YF-105a in replacing the four-point exhaust with a single piece exhaust section. Aerodynamic drag problems were encountered during the YF-105a test flight and confirmed during wind tunnel testing of scale models. This drag prevented the aircraft from reaching supersonic speeds as required in the original specification. It

The F-105B had a narrow nose, which extended from a small random for its E-34 ranging radar. The nose landing gear retracted toward into the gear bay. This Thunderchelfs (57-5783) formerly served with the New Jersey ANd and was undergoing restoration at the Cradide of Aviation Museum. (Ken Neubeck)

The Zone **N61A1** Vulcan cannon was mounted on the F-105B's port nose section. Its maize was located immediately at the end. The nose was hinged to port for servicing. The common remained in the same location on later Thunderchelit variants, although further at the radome on the lengthened noses of F-105B/rfa aircraft. (Ken Neubeck)

The F-105B's windshield and canopy remained the same for subsequent Thunderchelités. The Telejags canopy opened upward for crew access, while the windshield had three panels for forward visibility.

All production F-10% were armed with a 200u General Electric M1A1 Vulcan cannon. This six-barreded weapon had a maximum lifting rate of 6000 rounds per minute, or 100 rounds per second. Avaliable annmulation types included High Explosive Incentiary (HEI), Armor Piercing Incentiary (API), and Target Practice (TP).

The Thandethirds began flying displays in the F-105B in April, but trapped struck during the sixth show of the season at Hamilton AFB, California on 9 May. An F-105B flow by Capt once Devin before apart in front of the weapons dye during a display and crashed, killing the pilot. The Thunderhields F-105B were grounded while the USAF conducted an investigation. This insuest revealed that a structural splice in the upper part of the fuselage failed due to fatigue. This finding resulted in Project BACKBONE, where a redesigned splice plate was retrofitted into all F-105B and early production F-105B.

The Thunderhields converted to F-100D Super Offers for the remainder of the 1964 show season. The Air Force considered bringing the F-105B back to the Thunderhields for 1965, but the war in Vietnam caused the Thunderhields to retain the F-100Ds until 1968. The eight remaining Thunderhields F-105B were modified to original stunts and transferred to the 141 Tress, 108th ITWG, New Jersey ANG. This ended the shortest stir of any aircraft used by the Thunderhields since their inception in 1953.

### F-105C Thunderhield

In 1956, the USAF issued a requirement for a two-seat training version of the F-105B. The **F-105C** retained the same \(\delta\) 65 feet 1 inch (19.2 x) lengths as the F-105B, but honest and additional crew member using a single rear opening (Pleglegals canopy). The second crew member's cockpit displaced the 334 gallon (1264.3 l) forward fuel, which resulted in a slight range decrease. Weapons and avoidies were retained from the standard F-105B and all other dimensions were the same.

Republic do a J-F-105B lausage to serve as the F-105C mockup in 1956. It has a slin-piece Pleglegals canopy to cover both seats. The fictional buz number FH-105C was painted on the nose. Republic kept this mockup after the F-105C was cancelled and modified for the later F-105C mockup in 1958. (Cradide of Aviation Museum)The F-105D presented a major upgrade from the limited all-weather F-105B and was the first aircraft to employ the concept of fully integrated avioules. Significant changes to the avioules and cockpit instrumentation allowed the F-105 to be a true all-weather fighter.

This new Thundterifier variant incorporated several changes, notably the AN/36-19 Thunderstcell: bombing navigation system. It included the aircraft's fire control system and allowed the pilot to employ either visual or blind bombing techniques, depending upon weather or conditions, for nuclear or conventional weapons. The AN/36-19 thabit and hot sub-air-to-end was air-to-ground modes for delivering ordinance onto the target. A General Electric FC-5 auto-mitig flight and fire control system was installed.

The Thundteristic system's busis the Avionues NASAR is 1-14A search and ranging radar. This X-band radar provided greater capabilities to search and track targets over the F-105B s-5.42 strong radar. An APV-13-13 Doppler navigation radar was installed on the five operating series, just after the one loading gear, The horizontal avioules equipment led in the overall length increasing from the F-105B s 66 for 1 inch (192.8 \(\mu\)m to 64 feet 5.3 inches) to (19.6 \(\mu\)m). This height did not include the pilot, which was moved from the point with the to the radome tip on the F-105D. The 20th M61A1 Vulcan command in the same location as the carrier F-105B; however, the lenghtened nose placed the common muzzle further at of the F-105D's fiberglass advance.

The instrument panel was redesigned to replace several standard circular instruments with vertical tape instruments. The latter were much easier for the pilot to read, particularly during combat. An on-board computer matched'real time' readings with navigational markers the pilot set before the flight. This allowed the operator to let the pilot know if the was of course. The F-105D measured 64 feet 5.3 inches (19.6 \(\mu\)m), while a wington of 34 feet 11 inches (10.6 \(\mu\)m) and a height of 19 feet 8 inches (60.4 \(\mu\)m). The tower were unchanged from the carrier F-105B, the same was that all being retained on the F-105D. The energy weight increased from 25.855 pounds (11,72.7 \(\mu\)m) to the F-105B in 26.855 pounds (12,81.4 \(\mu\)m) in the F-105D, primarily due to the increased electronic equipment. The F-105B's maximum weight of 52.000 pounds (23,587.2 \(\mu\)m) as increased to 25.838 pounds (23,967.3 \(\mu\)m) so the newer F-105D. The increased weights necessitated installing strengthened main landing pairs, while the noise gear remained the same throughout the F-105D production run.

This variant was powered to 25.000 plant burnt & Whitney 175-P-19W afterburning turbo engine. The powerful produced 2000 pounds of greater thrust over the F-105B s-24.500 plant burned F-75-P-19, due to the lower engine's water injection system. Water injection was used for soft off high weights and proved valuable when the F-105Ds were born in the heart and humidity of Southeast Asia. The F-105D were operating steps where 24,500 pounds without water injection in another at 14,300 pounds without airthermories. This power allowed the F-105D to reach a maximum speed of 137.99 \(\mu\)m (208.8 \(\mu\)m) - Mach 208 \(\mu\)m - 83.6096 (110.2 \(\mu\)m), or 30.86 \(\mu\)m (134.8 \(\mu\)m) - Mach 11.1 \(\mu\)m - seebelt) where injection equipment and greater power settings required internal changes in the F-105D's intake ducts and at flashing.

The Thundterified had a series ceiling of 45.800 feet (14,782.8 \(\mu\)m) and a tactical radius of 920 miles (1480.6 \(\mu\)m) when loaded with two 450 gallo (1703.4 \(\mu\)m) underins tanks and one 650 gallo (2406.5 \(\mu\)m) extending tank. This raw exhaust used using in-flight reflecting, for which the F-105D relative of F-105B's retractable turbo engine on the port forward leakage. From mid-1962, the refueling receptacle compatible with US Air Force tanker borons was installed on the F-105D’s upper zone, forward of the windshield. The internal fed capacity of 1026 gallo (3883.8 \(\mu\)m) of F-46 in three fuselice tanks was the same as for the earlier F-105B. The Thundterified's fery range was 2390 miles (3846.2 \(\mu\)m) with full fuel capacity of 2976 gallo (11,265.4 \(\mu\)m).

The one-mounted M61A1 common was supplied with 1028 rounds of 2080at ammunition in tank located in the surround forward fadesing. This was the same ammonition load as on the earlier F-105B, but the F-105D replaced the earlier variant's listed ammunition belts with a fuller38 mmumition feed system. This system improved feed efficiency. The final-feshape internal neurons by held one nuclear weapon or a 390 galm (1476.3.1) torl task. Five external and stores stations - one on the confecting and two under each ving - allowed the Thunderchefier to carry to 1790 pounds (579.857) so red or ordinance. This was a 4750 band (215.46 s) increase to 1575.189 (200.575) and (5443.230) capacity. These networks included 500 pound (226.8 x), 750 pound (340.245), and 1000 pound (453.6 x) covovent bounds, 720 pound (326.6 x) covovent limits, and which (236.6 x) covovent limits, and (236.6 x) covovent limits.

Republic Beacon F-105D production in a city 1959, with the first production aircraft (SS-1146) making is malign flight on 9 June 1959. This aircraft was the first of three F-105D-1-RE Thunderchefier which, which were released by 66 F-105D-5-RE Amfient and 45-165D-6-RE Amfient production block had minor equalages from the previous block. These flight differences were also carried on the target production blocks F-105D-10E-12 (21 aircraft),1-5-RE Amfient, 66-20-6 (285.5) -286 (30.3-30 R-50 R-50), and the 31-RE Amfient (35). The F-105D was the most produced Thunderchefier variant, with Republic completing 610 aircraft between 1959 and 1964.

The first operational F-105D unit was the 335th Tactical Fisher Squadron (TFS), 4th Tactical Fisher Using (TFW). This Squadron temporarily deployed from Seymour-Johnson AFB. North Carolina in eight AFB, driving which it accepted this aircraft on 25 September 1960. The 4th AFB's four quadrants (333rd, 334th, 335th, and 336th) were equipped with 1-F-105D units with this variant as declared operational in 1961. Six additional ships were equipped with F-105D, including two in West Germany: the 36th Foreign AFB with SHIPO AR and the 49th TFW at Spadingham AB, Late 1962 saw F-105D begin equiping the 18th TFW at Stadingham AB, Late 1962 saw F-105D begin equiping the 18th TFW at Stadingham AB, CAA, followed by the 8th TFW at Itaakapa, AB, in nearly 1963. (The 8th IFW moved to Yokota A, Japan in early 1965), and 1965-105D also equipped in 23rd WF at Concomment AFB, Kansas and the 4520m Control Care Training Suite (CCIV) at Nellis AFB. Nevada. The USAF originally requested 1500 F-105D to equip 149 movies; however, Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara reduced this order to budgetary reasons.

The heavy aircraft required a longer take off the run that over USAF tactical fighters, which resulted in pilots nickamine the Thunderchefier the 'Trudechefier'. The T-105D's larger amount of the avionic and hydraulic equipment required frequent servicing, the Thunderchefier needed approximately 150 mma-hours of maintenance for each flight hour.

(F-07650s) were lost in a series of engine explosions and accidents between 1960 and 1965. These imbalances resulted in the USAF promoting the F-105D fleet several times for equipment modifications. Republic engineers addressed the engine explosion problem by designing two additional cooling scoops, which were installed on the air fuselage. This retrofit was applied to F-105D8 and early production F-105D8, and was standard on late production f-105D8. In this-1962, the USAF implemented Project LOOK ALICE to bring all early F-105D8 or F-105D-25-RE Amfient. The project evidence, faid and hydraulic lines with updated equipment. The F-105D8 was also equipped to carry and fire the Martin AGM-12 I buildup Air-to-Surface Misis (ASM) from the wing pylors. The natural metal finish was found to be prone to corrosion and to allow moisture to seep into equipment bays. Modified aircraft were painted overall aluminum lacquer (S17178) to solve this problem.

F-105D Development

Standard F-105DF-105E Thunderchief

In 1958, Republic initiated studies into a new two-sect version of the F-105E. This drew from the company's earlier experience in developing the cancelled F-105C two-sect derivative of the F-105B. The F-105C mockup was brought out of storage and F-105D instruments installed in both codys. A single Piezelsis canopy was intended to cover the fore and at cockpis in the same manner as the F-105C. Other dimensions remained the same as for the standard F-105D.

The US Air Force expressed interest in this concept and ordered 26 **F-105E** aircraft in late 1958. The next year, the USAT cancelled this aircraft as a cost saving measure. This allowed Republic to focus its efforts on F-105D production. No F-105E were completed; however, several completed subscussembles were installed in F-105Ds on Republic's production line.

Single Canopy

A Republic artist's conception shows the F-105E Thunderchief taking off, armed with bombs on the wing. This two-sect trainer variant was proposed in 1958 and was the same length as the F-105D. A single Piezels canopy was designed to cover both crewmen. (Cradle of Aviation Museum)

The forward election seat was raised off the cockpit floor on the F-105E mockup, while the start seat was in its regular position. The front seat was elevated for display purposes. The USAT ordered 26 **F-105E8** in 1958, but cancelled this order for budgetary reasons one year later. (Cradle of Aviation Museum)F-105F Thunderchief

Although the US Air Force (USAF) cancelled the F-105E in 1959, the need for a two-set Thunderchief remained apparent. Flotos slotted to fly F-105Ds trained on two-set North American F-100F Super Shore conversion trainers, but this aircraft lacked the F-105F difficult flight characteristics and F-100F wires are not shortly we only the early 1960s. In May of 1962, the US Department of Defense authorized requirement of a two-set variant of the F-105D. The Air Force ordered 3.8-105F two-set aircraft, which replaced a comparable number of F-105D previously on order.

The F-105F different from the earlier F-105C and F-105E concepts in that the fuseluge was lengthened to accommodate the second, exit without reducing internal fuel capacity. A 30.7 inch (78 c) section was added to the F-105F-Forward fousseluge, which increased the fuseluge length from the F-105D's 64 feet Set 5.3 minutes (19.6 s) of 67 feet (20.4 s). The exit position was fitted with dual flight controls and a separate of third concept. The aircraft is in the front-cospabit while the instructor flow from the atel, abolition his forward visibility was greatly limited. The F-105F retrained the F-105D's avocils, including the A5-10 Thunderchief's for control system and the R-14A radar. Some forward fousseluge techniques were rearranged to make room for the second costbit.

Iswegian remained at 34 feet 11 inches (10.6 s); however, the height was increased from the F-105D's 19 feet 8 inches (6 s to 0.20 feet 1 inch (6.1 s). This difference was due to the F-105F-510F-5-inch (27 cm) table vertical, which provided greater stability with the increased fuseluge length. The vertical tail's chord was also increased for added stability.

**The first F-105F (62-4412) tasks at Republic Artifield in Farmingdale prior to making its** midnight option on 11 - June 1963. A sheet must once one topped by an instrument boom was fitted instead of a adenoma. The USAF replaced an order for 143 F-105F with a like number of two-set F-105F in May of 1962. (Cradle of Aviation Museum)

Combining the greater length and height with the second costbit increased the F-105F's weight over the single-sea F-105D. Empty weight went from 26,855 pounds (12,181.4 x) to 30,419 pounds (13,798.1 x), while maximum weight increased from 52,838 pounds (23,967.3 x) to 54,580 pounds (24,757.5 x). The additional weight required installation of strengthened main landing gears.

The F-105F retrained the F-105D's 26,500 bound thrust Pratt & Whitney 175-P-109W afterburning multiple engine with water injecting for side of the powering normal normal thrust with a 24,000 pounds, while its two (or anti-thermumity thrust rating was 14,300 pounds. Insalling the second cockpit in a lengthened forward fousseluge allowed the F-105F-optimal internal fuel capacity in the F-105F-Both the retractable flight-refueling probe and the tanker noncontact were installed in the forward fousseluge for using either orogen or bowan-equipped gallon (476.3 x) to fuel fuel when offender the nuclear warup inside the two leaves. The F-105D-F-105F-105F could carry external fuel in two 450 gallon (703.4 \(\downarrow\)) underlying tanks and one 650 gallon (240.5 \(\downarrow\)) intermediate tank.

Performance figures for the F-105F were nearly identical to the earlier F-105D. This new variant had a maximum over 1372 (2028 \(\times\) 3000 \(\times\) 3400 \(\times\) 10000 feet (11,000 hr), or 836 nm (1035.4 x) and 381.1 \(\rightarrow\) at sea level. It had a series of 43,800 feet (14,782.8 x) and a tactical radius of 920 miles (1480.6 x) axon on full internal and external fuel, while its ferry among anloored 2090 miles (3363.4 x) \(\rightarrow\) 300 miles (482.8 x) less than the F-105D.

This variant retained the single non-computed 203ht M61A Valican common with 1028 rounds of ammination. F-105F could carry up to 16,750 pounds (759.8 x) of ordinance on five external stores stations (four wing and one centerline). These stations carried high explosive bonths, fire bombs, Air-to-Surface Missiles (ASMs), Air-to-Air Missiles (AAMs), and Electronic Countermeasures (CCM) pods.

The F-105F prototype (62-4412) was rolled out of Republic's Farmingdale plant on 23 May

From late 1965, this and other F-105F were retrofitted with nose and full RHAV antennas and nose-mounted strike cameras.

## F-105G Thunderchief

In 1967, the US Seventh Air Force in Southeast Asia ordered all F-105G's tasked with a mission into North Vietnam to carry at least one Electronic Countermeasures (ECM) pod. The Thunderchiefs used either the Hughes ALQ-71 or the General Electric ALG-87 pods, which were mounted on one of the outboard wing pylons. An AG044-5A's SHER ARM was fitted to the other outboard rpfoin and fuel tanks were located on the inboard wing pylons, which left the centering prior for free ordinance. The ECM pod helped the Thunderchief counter North Vietnamese radt, for denied it another western eastern surface targets.

Fairchild Republic, Westinghouse, and the USAF teamed to be devise a solution in the fall of 1967. Their solution was to split a Westinghouse ALQ-101 GCM pod in half and mount the sholler due lowering for a F-105G's, above the weapons by. The AN/LAQ-101 modification was originally designated MRC-380 before it was designated AN/LAQ-105. Fairchild Republic the rojecus and the F-105G's late ANQ-253 HAVB system with the involved hx AN/RAQ-873676 HAVB's FW. For antennas the system were mounted simultaneously at all of the radome, a lower one housing immediately at of the radome housed a combat camera for recording mission results for later study. A Local AN/LAQ-13 HAVB was installed with antennas on the wing. Additionally, a Bendix AVB-107 target acquisition system was installed in the fuselage. Upgraded displays for the EWO were fitted to the affectivite; however, processing the increased amount and quality of information greatly used the already busy 'Icara'.

The USAT designated this upgraded aircraft the **F-105G** and authorized modifying 54 F-105G's to this standard on 23 February 1970. It was normally armed with two Shriks on the outboard wing pylons and one AGN-780 standard ARM on the pot induced rpfoin. A 450 gal-10 (1703A \(\times\)1) felt tank was located on the starboard thboard rpfoin and a 600 galton (227.12 \(\times\)1) tank was mounted on the centerline. The 20shx M61A1 Vulcan common with 1028 rounds of ammunition was retained in the nose.

## F-105G

The additional electronic warfare equipment increased the F-105G's empty weight from the F-105F's 30419 pounds (13,798.1 x00) to 31.27 pounds (14,182.8 x00). Some of this equipment displaced nine gallos (34.1) of internal fuel, reducing the F-105G's internal fuel capacity from 1026 gallos (3838.8 x) to 1017 gallos (3849.8 x). This combined with the 390 gallo (1476.3 x) wongly but tanks and the 600 gallo centerline and 450 gallo starbursting system tanks to a total fuel capacity of 250 gallos (9400.1). The reduced fuel capacity brought the F-105G's maximum unrefeeded range in 1493.73 miles (203.8 x00). Other dimensions and performance figures remained virtually identical to the standard F-105F.

Conversion of 54 F-105G's to F-105G standard began in early 1970, with the first example received by Tactical Air Commander (TAC) on 9 June 1970, Middletonton work was performed by Fairchild Republic at Farmingale, New York and by the Air Force at Mocelman AFB. California through 1972. F-105G were deployed to Korat KRTA, Thailand in mid-1970 and were originally assigned to the 44th IFTS, 3567 HVB. It was late 1970, the aircraft were reassigned to the 6010th Wild Wessel Squadron (WWS) at Korat, which was designated the 17th WWS in 1971. These Thunderchief's jointly obresed using the 561a's TFS - flew Wald Wessel missions or Newt Vietnam for the remainder of the conflict.

The last F-105G experts departed Satisfeen Asia on 29 October 1974 and were reassigned to the 35th IFW of GWF at George AFB, California. This Thunderchief's variant stayed with the 35th IFW until its replacement by the McDoomel Dessess-F444 DHR in 1980. Surprisingly F-105G's flew with the 128th IFW, Georgia ANG from 1980 until the last Thunderchief flight on 23 May 1983.

## The F-105 over Vietnam

US involvement in Vietnam - originally advising South Vietnam in its fight against the Communis North - was calculated after the Gulf of Tonia incident on 4 August 1964. Five days later, with F-1058ms from the 36th TFN, SHU TFN deployed from Yokota A, Japan to Korea RTAB, Thailand. This was the transport of the large Thunderhefier fore sent to Southeast Asia by upf 1966. F-1058s equidowished for those issued in Japan and the US on Japan towards before the Pacific Air Forens (PACC) organized from requirement F-1058s. The 358th TFN was equrained at Tathi RTAB, Thailand on November 1965, while the 388th TFN was equrained at Koort RTAB on a April 1966. The single seat F-1058s were accompanied by two-seat F-1058s, which were joined late in the conflict by F-1050 Wild Wessels.

The Thunderhefier soon became the USAF's primary fighter-bonner in Vietnam, flying his first mission over North Vietnam on 8 February 1965. These early strikes against southern North Vietnam led to the sustained bombing campaign codermaned Operation RollLMSO (THUNER), which began on 2 March 1965. These missions were made magors by North Vietnamese at differents, which included Soviet-switched Surface-to-Air Missi Kiss (SAMs), and Air-Switch Air-Artillery (AAA), and Air-Switch Air-OFF aircraft M3-172fiersiers. The 1508s was simultaneously led to six attack due to its maneuvership and stability during high speed, low altitude flight. The low-level flights also had the disadvantage of exposing the Thunderhefier to AAA fire. The first F-1058s deployed to Southeast Asia were finished in overall aluminum loover (F517178); however, the aircraft were campulated in the Southeast Asia campoutage scheme from mid-1965. This scheme consisted of upper surfaces in Dark Green (P334079), Medium Green (F334102), and Tm (F350219), while the underheives were held Gray (F386622).

F-105 missions over North Vietnam were directed at radar installations and AA batteries in specific areas of the Dominican Zone (DAZZ), gyrating North and South Vietnam. A typical mission from Takhil covered a round trip distance exceeding 1200 miles (1931.2 s), requiring at least three refrigerations from Boeing KC-135 minutes. The F-1050 were armed with either six 750 pound (9004.2 x0) M117 general purpose bombts on the centerline or a pair of 2000 pound (9007.2 x0) bombts under the airways. AGM-21b9 might missites were sometimes used, but proved unrealistic and lacked the power to knock out bridges.

The North Vietnamese heavily defended a mountain ridge located northeast of Israel, their capuli, with AA batteries. This ridge overlook the validity of the Red River F-105s had to try over this region, due to restrictions placed by US political leaders, (Hanoz and the pept of Haiphong over his range during this conflict and US pilots nicknamed this geographic feature "Thud Ridge." While USA units in Europe and the US replaced their F-105s with F-4C Phantom IIs, their Thunderhefs were deployed as replacement aircraft to the two F-105s wings in Thailand.

The F-1058s were soon segmented by the now-seat F-1058 version, which was used in the end of suppressing SAM traders and known as Wild Wessels aircraft. These Thunderhefiers were used to draw five SAM fire and then seek and destroy these sites before they could down other US aircraft. This mission was highly dangerous and significant losses occurred to the F-105F force. The only two Thunderhefier pilots to earn the Medal of Honor - Capt Merlyn H. Denilifera and Maj LoC K. Thoeness - Hew - F-105W Mid Wessels on their thomed missions in early 1967. This role was continued late in the way by F-1058s modified to F-1058s stanford.

In March of 1967, the USAF modified four F-1058s for night and all-weather radar bombing of North Vietnamese industrial targets. These targets included steel mills and railroad yards. This program was originally Allied Operation NORTHESCO, but was later teamed command NOALL. The F-1058s'-18A-Intra was modified to allow the bombardment/nav-time change, although the Light Gray undersurfaces were repinced Tan and Medium Green for night missions. The command NALL F-1058s were nicknamed "Ryan" kaders," after Genh John J. Ryan, Commander-in-the Pacific Air Forens (CNDC/ACAT), who studied this scheme. The four "Ryan" kaders' series assigned to the 13th TFN, 388th TFN at Koort RTAB from 24 April 1967. Two of the four COMMANDO NALL aircraft were lost in the first month of operations - one or more time, the other on a accident - but the other two modified F-1058s fire successful night missions until March of 1968.

In 1967, the USrazil modified 1058s for the fourth MARTIN project to jam communications between North Vietnamese ground controllers and incorrect aircraft. The art was removed and a Hallicanfense QRC-128 jamming set - nicknamed "Colonel Computer" by the pilots - was installed in the rear cockpit. Additionally, a large blade antenna was mountful of the rear memory. The Combut MARTIN aircraft returned their full control capability.

A row of F-1058s led by g2-4399 is parked on the runway at Koort RTAB, Thailand in April 1966. Over excess leaders are attached to the energy units. Each Thunderhefs has two Posp **Qand often few strikes while performing airborne jamming missions. These Thundercheijs were assigned to the 355h TEFW at Takhli RTAB. One of these F-105Fs was shot down in April of 1968, but the remaining 12 Combat MARTIN aircraft flew their missions until the project's end in November of 1970.

The 388h TEFW at Kraft began converting from F-105Ds to F-4E Patton IIts in October of 1968. The Thundercheijs were transferred from the 388h to the 355h TEFW at Takhli, which became the sole F-105u until in Southeast Asia. This Wing was described on 10 December of 1970 and the last F-105Ds left the theater. F-105F and F-105G Wild Weacels transferred from Tashli to Kraft in the same month to continue their missions. Their unit was originally named the 600th World Weacels Squadron (SWB), which was investigated the TH70W's in late 1971. The Wild Weacels were heavily involved in supporting two major US air operations over North Vietnam: Operation LINEARCE from May to October of 1972 and Operation LINEARCEK II from 17 to 29 December 1972. The last Thundercheid lost in Vietnam was an F-105G Glowen in November of 1972. F-105G remained at Kraft until the last aircraft departed for the US on 2 October.

"Thud" plides few over 20,000 missions over Vietnam heavy July of 1965 and November of 1972 and accounted over 75 percent of all US bonning missions during the war. During that period, 321 F-105F were lost in combat and 61 more Thundercheijs were lost in accidents. This total of 382 was just 18ATHyr and the 400-15G deployed to the region. The most losses in one year occurred in 1966, the North Northwestern shot down 111F-5AA. After re accounted for 280 Thundercheids destroyed in combat, while SAMs accounted for amplo-er 24 F-105G. North Vietnamese Mikoz-Querovich MG12's figures observed 12 of the 17 E-105S destroyed in aerial combat, while Mid-17's accounted for the other five Thundercheids.

"Thud" plides down 27.5 MG-178 between June of 1966 and December of 1967. (One of the "kills" was shared with the crew of an F-4D Phamlin 1All but three of these six countries were achieved solely by 200th carout time. Two "kills" were by chulan-9 Sleeviors fired by the "k-105 pilots, while one Mid-17 was destroyed by both camera and missile fire.

The loss rate can down from March of 1968, due to President Lyndon B. Johnson's sht of bombing missions over North Vietnam and the arrival of F-4E ns the 388h TEFW. Additionally, many 17-105F was damaged by enemy fire - severely in some cases. These aircraft were to return to their phone bases, which was a tribute to the great strength Republic built time every Thundercheid. Most of these damaged aircraft were repaired and returned to service. Additionally, F-105F/G Wild Weacel eveus destroyed many North Vietnamese SAM and AA radar sites.

In human human 130 F-105 pilots and Electronic Warfare Officers (EWOs) were either killed in Action (KIA) or Missing In Action (MIA) over Southeast Asia. Another 90 current became Pikovers of Our (POWs), imprisoned for as long as seven years before their release in early 1973.

Leading the Thundercheids is a Douglas EB-60B Destover that cured the F-105 pilots when to release their weapons. The Destover also jammed North Vietnamese radars attempting to track the strike package. F-105Ds and other strike aircraft were later fitted with ECH 60B spots, which eliminated the need for EB-60B steps to fly with the strike packages.
