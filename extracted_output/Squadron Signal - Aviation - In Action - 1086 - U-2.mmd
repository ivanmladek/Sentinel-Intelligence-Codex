CIA Chief of Research and Development, Dr Joe Charyk, and Johnson, an agreement was reached where Johnson would re-design the CL-282 so use the Point & Whitney \(\,\)-57.

Johnson redesigned the fuselage to accommodate the larger diameter \(\,\)-57 still using F-104 technology. The two programs complained each other one each stressed with authors to join performance. A maximally opened disk shaped, similar to the F-104, diminished the canopy hydraulic system. The F-104 ejection sent was eliminated: a pilot could start a built at proposed operating time-dates, and the storage cross-sections, or intraclass, and unit level of the F-104.

Johnson had indicated that he could build twenty aircraft plans were parts for 822 million, and that he would deliver the prototype within months of signing the contract. One's December 1994 (CELA award) technological development counter under the code name Project AQLIONC. The shiply classified prototype was found from two indifferent sources. CIA finds for the airplane, and Air Force funds for the segments (which were purchased in order 8-25 square coverage compared to Exercise 1848. Although the aircraft carried outwards wide rationale design, it turned (52.1 million) want to advance his own the C.N. The prototype featured a sliding versus corner inside the cockpit system was not given a Acknowledgment model number, being known as CIA Chief 3A1. Our story was prepared against the aircraft as was high altitude reached platform for the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NAAC).

While the "Skan" button's design building the hand reactor prototype, Johnson began searching for a location as the top-agent prototype, which had been nicknamed the "August" by the Lockwell Ltd. As a specific location was found at Green Dr. Jake which was part of the Atomic Energy Commission's atomic rest facility in the northwest and North AFB Bay. By today 1956 the last six, nicknamed The "Knut" was really, and was the prototype on the 20-24 July 1956 the completed prototype was disseminated and prepared for shipment. The fuselage was covered in 14th and 18th mode on a T-240 Gkema-140 Gkema-140, with the engine and being long longled into account 1.2. The prototype was then low to 20th source in a reasonable manner and hidden in a barrier.

The prototype resulted a 4-year spreader shifting with a slender fuselage, long tapered stripes, and tall in and milder. It was 49 feet inches long with a suspension of 88 feet inches and height 15 feet inches. The prototype obtained 12.000 pounds empty, with a tilted weight of 2200 pounds.

U-2A

After the U-2 prototype had successfully completed its initial light test program during late 1956, the U-2A collected the aircraft into production. The initial controller called for twenty aircraft under the Air Force designation (U-2A Production U-2A differed from the prototype in a number of ways: the U-500 best Pratt & Whitmore 1957-97 engine was replaced with a 11,200 hot 17-57-91A engine specifically built for high altitude operation. The commands washable in the canopy was replaced by a suction of the upper canopy plagies which was painted while to reflect the sun. A boost, that shaped fatigue was added to the rear (fasting under the radiator which was used to house either a breaking parachute or additional sensors. Early production aircraft can not find with ejection as follows, although they never reinterfed so all U-2A aircraft. U-2A were delivered to the U-2A at 60% C in order to prevent the risk of the necessary servicing strategies.

All subsequent variants of these early U-2A were based on the production U-2A air-frame. Since the number of aircraft to be built was more emodured to be high, included recently enabled a production line in the normal sense, with all aircraft produced being basically hand made airflows. With the many interchangeable modifications done to the U-2A, has become necessary in sympathetic to state with certainty the cost needed a specific aircraft within the U-2A series, or was Changs and reconfiguration of basic U-2A air-frame were worn, with U-2A being bright as U-2A (U-2A) and has their retrofit.

This overall Patel Binck, CA U-2A carries thus NASA lift marking and a state Air Force aerial to be U-2B configuration. Serial numbers were often measured and switched for service on the tail in which CA aircraft normally were devoid of making exceed during security reasons. CA, NAAC, and NAAC still ignittings over assigned to a random and the same "N" marker was offing assigned to two different aircraft. Because of the security surrounding the program, total production figures are also difficult to store accurately. It is believed that that at least as early (1-2s built with fifty-five Air Force serial numbers having been confirmed as belonging to early U-2A.

In a part of the security surrounding early production U-2A, run-0A data was followed marked with National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NAAC) through an on the tail. NAAC never pulled to 2A, although this successor, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NAAC) obtained several for high altitude research with (NAAC).

**U-2Ct**

The U-2Ct was a two-cast conversion of one U-2C slitframe and one U-2D slitframe. The U-2Ct had a second cockpit installed above and behind the first cockpit with the vacuum occupying the upper half the equipment "Q" by. U-2Cts were used as flight estimates with all sensor equipment deleted.

**U-2D**

Five U-2Airframes still in production were completed with a modified systems "Q" flag, which could house either a second-core member or alternate error systems. A rear missed every match with two small windows was installed on the upper fuselage engine behind the cockpit classo to pinelate the upper "Q" flag has batch. Besides the five initial conversions, at least one other U-2A airframe was rebuilt up-2D standards and one U-2D airframe was later modified to the two U-2Ct trainer configuration.

**U-2E**

A number of U-2A and U-2B airframes were modified with J-75-P-13B engine, additional ECM equipment mounted in pods on the tail, and a small fuselage spine electronics "caro" featuring. At least eighteen U-2A aircraft were modified to U-2E standards and were assigned solely to the CIA.

**U-2F**

Four U-2A airframes were modified for inlight rotating with a reflorting recogplete mounted on the upper fuselage spine in the front of the dorsal cone failing. After a series of combat tests with the reflorting equipment, these aircraft were retrofitted to U-2C stan dark with the reflorting equipment deleted.

**U-2G**

Two U-2C airframes were modified for aircraft carrier operations with sharp contrast to books, reinforced landing gear and wing/high skis, and the addition of large speakers clamp fusion landing. These aircraft were later retrofitted back to U-2C standards and assigned to NASA.

**U-2J/U-2N**

These designations are believed to have been designations reserved for modifications that were not standardized, or for aircraft that were modified with internal fixures for installation of an anterior hook for carrier operations. These designations remain unverified.

The 1-20 was not configured with that controls and was used for various high altitude research measurements. (ISISAR via Andrew)CIA Operations

While the Slank Works won building the first production aircraft, the CIA was selecting and training services. To push the CIA screenings process pilots had 0 demonstrate exchange, resistance to classroom, and had to be cleared for high level security clearness. The plates were at "multiferroed" to the CIA from their respective service. Various owners were used and a number of these plates were "employed" by Lockheed under the idle "Flight Test Consultants." Before beginning flight training, these were then created and labeled on CIA systems and paintings -- which they owned over a more rigid plan any military regulations. By April of 1936 the first group of high cross had completed their CIA association, U2 flight training, and were located operationally ready. The screw, along with the first two production U2-A, were then by C14-Bitobenzene cargo aircraft to RAI Labasorben, England to begin operations for their first operational mission. To preserve security, the unit was given a military cover designation, Weather Reconnaissance Spazion (Provisional) -1 and a cover of using a high altitude water research unit.

Notify a year earlier, in July 1935, President Eisenbower had proposed an "Open Skate" policy for the entire world -- including the Soviet Union. It was known that the Soviet has a nuclear capability and were developing a delivery system capable of environmental studies. Since most US Government scientists are open to the public, Eisenbower was willing to be the world such that it's would do the same. Nikola Knuchev and the Soviet leadership balated in the proposal and enclosed to negotiate on 1. With the Soviet request to negotiate, Operation OVER/14/C, the domestic aerial to rebuild the service of the Soviet Union, was given in the gas-based.

With the handful of CIA/CIA/CIA/CIA and U2-A in position at RAI Labasorben, President Eisenbower gave permission for the first overridships of Soviet airspace. High-ranking British officials, however, who had been needed to the area infusion of the "weighted carf" and the possible consequences, objected by having the overridships going from British soil. As a result with WR(P) moved in Novosibaden, West Germany and it was from this base that the first overridship took place.

On 4 July 1936, Article 07(1-D2 Air Force Seattle 56-608) led Westerborken AB housed for Moscow and Landsman, to find the most recently afterwardness in the world. The flight was a complete success and Soviet declines had been caught off guard. The Sorris made no mention of the intruder aircraft to the world press, and the phaberlights obtained by the U2-A project to be photochemically close. Additional overridships were scheduled and received President Eisenbower's immediate approval.

The second CIA unit, WR(P)-2, became operational at IacribiAB, near Adams, Turkey in August 1956. Originally known as WR(P)-2, the unit's CIA designation was Detachment 10-10. In February of 1937 WR(P)-1 moved to Gehinehika, A remote near Warsaw, Germany, Philip-1937, WR(P)-1038, was considered with WR(P)-2 with both annual moving to India their status discovered that Gehinehkat had been penetrated by Soviet intelligence -- the KGB. Overridships confirmed the 1960, with over thirty missions being Housi, and with great practical approval. Misiose remotely deep into Russian airspace, using off from Turkish houses and returning the same base some nine hours later. During 1935 a third s unit, WR(P)-3, became operational at Awayi Air Base in Japan for overridships of Asian targets.

The Soviet air defense force, the PNO, made a number of attempts to intercept these early certifships, although all were unsuccessful. The Mid-15, Mid-17 and Mid-19 interferogen then in service could not reach the U2-S operating distance. Later Mid-21 (fibers would be used to attempt room climb interrupts, and although the Mid-21 could reach the U2-S ahinded in a perfectly executed zoom climb, it could not maneuver. At the ages of the climb the Mid-21 was ballistic and U2-I pilots could simply turn away from

aircraft such as the RF-AC Phantom lock over the reconnaissance duties over the North. The U-2s, however, were still used for stand of surveillance missions. One aircraft was lost during the Vietnam War, a U-2C (50-600) which was 38st over South Vietnam from structural failure.

Following the Vietnam War, detachments of U-2s were assigned to various bases throughout the Free World, flying outboard feeder electronic surveillance missions. In 1975 sts U-Cs were deployed to Europe to test a prototype unarguing system under the code name _H_on_. There U-2s flying it precisely known distances were used to triangulate the locations of Warsaw Patel electronic emirrora while flying over friendly airspace. At the specific request of the British government, these U-2s-X were pointed in a special use one Gray cammodifier, known as the Sabur Schwen, instead of their standard Flat Black scheme. The U-2s remained at RAF Wethersfield until August of 1975, when they were ferried back to Davis Mondan ATR.

The threat from surface to air emissions has ended high altitude U-2-overfights of hostile territory with that mission now being carried out by ultra-equplicated reconnaissance satellites and ultra-high speed high altitude aircraft such as the Kelly Johnson-designed SR-17A Blokoff, U-2s, however, continued to serve in research projects, stand of surveillance, and a number of U-1s disaster trial missions. During the late 1970s now military flights become increasingly more prevalent. During one such flight, several U-2s were used to conduct a least test test test test test, and a half hazard missions from California, this to Guatem to survey the damage caused by an earthquake which desvalued Guatem City during February of 1976. Another ARF Force U-2s was used to photograph a 600 square mile area of the Pacific searching for survivors of a sunknot. Flying from 60(300) feet, the U-2 cameras detected the ship's yellow life unit and the survivors were successfully resolved.

## U-2r

By early 1966 the number of remaining U-2s in the inventories of both the CIA and US Air Force had been significantly reduced through combat losses and attrition. To make for further issues the Defense Department, acting forth the CIA and Air Force, awarded Excellence a development/producation contract for one prototype and twelve production aircraft in August of 1966. Rather than six results in the original U-2 production facility, the CIA approach Lockheed with a proposal to redesign the U-2s to correct some of the deficiencies in the original U-2s. As some packages had increased in weight, the original U-2s began suffering from poor flight characteristics at mission altitudes. The CIA award this problem correctly in the new U-2 production program using improvements in the landing characteristics, camped cockup, range, and payload capabilities of the aircraft. Additionally the CIA award the airframe strespight-coated to improve the integrity testing life, Kelly Johnson's Sumi Wrois team began back to correcting the problem areas and came up with a design that, while based on the U-2s, was entirely new aircraft.

Lockheed began work on the U-2R (R or Revised) prototype in late 1966. The 17,000 hPa from 1973-P-15-10 of the earlier U-2s series was retained for the U-2s future (a steps are published and would provide excellent power for the new design). The storage was extended both in front and behind the wing increasing overall length from 4.91 feet to 5.2 feet. The storage streak allowed soon for an enlarged occupied with a new U-2s operation seat, and a enlarged "Q" 3D capable of housing updated sensor powders, detection countermeasure systems, a strengthened relief to release infrared emissions, and provisions for an original area flow for carrier operations.

The horizontal and vertical full surfaces were both enlarged (the horizontal surfaces between U-2s and between reinforced with external ribs passing back from the stabilized loading depth). The wing was increased in length from 80.17 feet to 103 feet. The lengthened wing featured tricch leading edge and still strips and swing spoilers to improve her speed control during landing, carried leaf tests, and folding signifying for carrier operations. Additionally the wing was strengthened to permit the use of larger moving mouset sensor or tear "gaps" which attached to the wing leading edge. These structural changes raised the gross weight from 34.000 pounds (U-2X) to 41,000 pounds for the U-2R. To handle the increased weight the main landing gear was strengthened.

Performance differed little from the earlier U-2s series except in range. With an 1,700 gallos of interest fast, range was increased from 4.700 samples (U-2X) to 4.000 times for the U-2R. Service U-2R have down non-stop from Beale AFB. California, to forward bases in England = a distance of some 5,000 miles with a flight time of some fourteen hours.

The prototype U-2s R made a first flight 23 August 1967. After about and intensive flight period, the first production U-2sR was delivered in the CIA at Edwards AFB, North Bank alone, during late 1966. North Bank based the main CIA-2C-Operations base (the stand down after the Puresesional, CIA U-2s were absorbed from North Bank to Operating Locations (CIA) in Florida (for Cuban overlightity) and Taiwan for mainland CIA withgrids).

All remaining U-2s aircraft, bearing Nationalistic Chinese Air Force ingingingin and flown by Chinese stress, were used to verify mailing CHA Union 1964 through 1974. During 1974, however, all Chinese multileg operations were ordered cancelled to accordance with an apparent mouset channel between the US and Red China following Presidential Issues 1974 (a division C. Following the behaviour of Chinese program(TAL): 2 operations began a steady decline with the remaining Agency aircraft being passed to Air Force control.

During 1966 the Air Force had begun redesignating and ruicocating their U-2 units. The 4080th SRW, veteran of the Cuban Minville Crisis, moved from Laughlin AFB, Texasto Davis Monthian AFB, being redesignated the 100th SRW. During 1976 the Air Force elected to consolidate its strategic reconnaissance system under one organization and the 100th SRW was transferred to Beale AFB. California. The consolidation placed the U-2 units within an SRW, alongside Louchfoy's other reconnaissance platform -- the SRW-17A hydraulic.1

## TR-1

By 1977 the active Air Force intensity of both early model U-2A and U-2B6 had been seriously reduced through accidental and antitrusive. This reduction came at a time when the Air Force was an increasing need for the U-2B in standard electronic surveillance, especially in the NATO Meteor. As a result, the Department of Defense awarded Lock-neutral contract to prepare the U-B reproduction line. The initial portion of the contract, SU-210 million, was examined for participating the U-B reproduction facility and participating whatever new testing might be necessary.

On 18 November 1979, twelve years after the last U-2B had rolled off the Lockheed assembly line, production of the U-2B was reinstated. These new predictions aircraft were externally identical to the U-2B6, with one exception. The Defense Department decided that the U-2B6 augmentation should be changed to one that there closely described the aircraft's mission. The production contract, issued in December 1979, stated that there's production U-2B8 would be built under the designation TR-1 (Sectional Reconnaissance-1).

The initial TR-1 production contract called for production of TR-1A and one CERN. The first U-2B6, ARM Resources Ten, basically a TR-1A with all military sports dedicated. The aircraft was built for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and is used for upper atmospheric research, alongside several U-3C6 that remain in the NASA memory. Production of the TR-1A/ER2 began in June 1979, with the first U-6-millimeter DE-AR, roofing for extension 1 May 1981. The prototype RI-1A/ER2 of the RI-1A/ER2 of the PI-10 simulation line making is fast flighted August [188], followed shortly by the second RI-1A. These first two TR-1A-sites were used for right tests, systems development, and pilot training.

The TR-1A/ENO/enounced a number of major internal changes from the U-2B-scan carry the latest developments in a airborne verification scheme such as the Hughes Advanced Synthetic Agrate Solar System (NASA) and Lockheed Precision Entire Cointure System (PLSLS). Only which has been successfully applied for one year of the U-2B6, the CASA system is housed in a detachable business terminated zone adjacent and allow the ICR to be used hundreds with a high resolution catalyst which is capable of producing imagery of mobile agents without exposing the TR-10 isobile action. The PLS system consists in a passive carrier-locative usually carried in a "Suger" food" mounted on either wing. The system requires three TR-1A-s working together to straightize hostile radio emissions. In a court to take these TR-1A-bus would relay the information by melt-income civil intelligence data in a ground station where the location of the enemy radar a quickly related and an strike scheduled against it. These systems not only enhance the TR-1A is ability to perform standoff visibility, they are much lighter than previous systems and impose for fewer performance penalties.

Following a short flight test program the Air Force officially announced that Lockheed had been awarded a multi-phaseed production contract for the TR-1B, Production would be present over three years, with first TR-1B being in 1982, four in 1984, and five in 1984 with a total requirement for driving-the aircraft (awenty-five TR-1A-s and ten U-2B-string replacement aircraft) before production based on Lockheed in the contract were two TR-1B two cost failures. The TR-1B was similar to the earlier U-2C7 with the second configuration installed in the "Q" high with a cockheed energy installed above and the center of the pilots capable. The first flight of the TR-1B took place on 23 February 1983.

In addition to the TR-1A-s the contract also called for construction of the U-2B8 as antitrusive replacements to fill out the depleted Air Force inventory. Additionally, an antitrusive injection of these aircraft were slated to meet the needs of "non-indigenous"

NASA U-2s

During the early days of the U-2 program extensive use was made of the core warp that is external much National Advisory Committee for Armous Research aircraft. Press Press notes were issued by the Air Force and NACA that the Air Force Weather Service in cooperation with NACA were using the U-2 for high altitude weather research. Although some number information was gathered by early U-2s, it was a popular of their inefficient operation since rather than a dedicated Air Force. In reality, the NACA, had absolutely no control or input to the early U-2 program.

From 295 through 293, NACA and later its successor, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) recommends the U-1 - 2's analysis a project for the Central Intelligence Agency. Through 1997, the Air Force placed on permanent boat to NASA with U-3C: Las-UNASA and NASA-NARSA based at the Anne Research Center, Naval Air Station Moffet, California, these two U-2s were used to form the NASA High Altitude Missories Branch (HAME). Under HAMB the aircraft were too on a variety of earth resources projects, such as water managers, land use, disaster assessment, photographic survey, and mapping.

One of the major projects undertaken by the NASA U-2s was the Anes Airborne Instrumentation Research Project. This project involved flights by the U-2 in conjunction with the track of the Earth Resources and Technology Satellite (ERTS). Those missions collected test data for step by government, university, and industrial scientists in connection with the EETIS program. The NASA U-2s also use used to support the flight of XETIS, the ground orbiting research station.

NASA missions are conjugate in that all photographs and data obtained are part of the "Public Domain", that is, open to the general public. The Ames Research Center maintains goals of all imagery, a mission between life, and various light tables and viewing equipment. With prior arrangements such as ours with NASA imagery and ecology any photos they wish (with their own equipment), NASA publishes reports of each mission (from and maintaining computational data base for all actual measurements missions, data base is also taken to the public.

In June 1992 the UK was a US-2 system joined by the single ER-20N-TRAN. The 88-2 (Earth Resources-2) was the first for the TR-1 series to be marked and is to be 7-10 with all railway student sensors removed NASA's first operational mission with the ER-2 took place in 12 June 1992. Initial missions with the ER-2 were limited to pilot training and finalization, while the aircraft's superpose was completed to accept NASA's narrow. The ER-2 has an increased
