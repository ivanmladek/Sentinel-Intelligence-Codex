## Introduction

By the time the First World War started in August of 1914, Thomas Sopwith had already distinguished himself in the aviation world by setting an amazing number of aerial records. He had crowned these accomplishments with the establishment of the Sopwith Aviation Company. His company went on to produce an aircraft which won for Great Britain much coveted Schneider Trophy (in the second of the Schneider races). Indeed, the future seemed bright for the Sopwith Company in the spring field, with a entry submitted for the Aerial Derby and plans in motion to compete in the London-Paris-London Air Race. All of these plans quickly vanished with the outbreak of war, with military orders fully occupying the output of the two Kingston factories for the next four years.

The first Sopwith aircraft to go to war were also among the earliest military machines to be taken on strength by the Royal Naval Air Service. After the opening of hostillies, a part of standard Sopwith Libdosta, a Tractor Biplane and the prototype Laboid were all impressed into Admirality service.

It was not long before the firstro Sholabtsev hot to make history when their pilots, like Spencer Grey and LT Maris, were ordered to bomb the airshp shols a Utseloff and Kolp the College during October of 1914. To reach the first of these targets called for an outward trip of 103 miles, with the second target being nine miles more distant; long range missions for open cockpitplanes.

It was, however, the advent of the Sopwith 1 % Strutter that firmly established the name of Sopwith as a producer of quality fighting aircraft. The 1 % Strutter was largely overshadowed by other Sopwith aircraft, but it was instrumental in the development of the South Pup -- as pretty and stick as a throughout horse, as one American Officer was later to record. The use of the larger 1 % Strutter by both France and the American Expeditionary Force, plus the seizure of any 1% Strutter that force landed in Dutch territory, and itself to the qualities of the design.

The Camel was first destea long than anything the Kingston factories had built before and the very lack of stability that the design incorporated meant to, in skilled hands, the "title beast" was an astonishing maneuverable; 5,490 Sopwith Camels were produced along with several experimental versions. The variety of arrangement it was capable of carrying, the development of the 2F.1 and the appearance of the Shallow all testify to the potential of the Camel design.

The best qualities of the Camel were reflected in its successor, the Sopwith Ships. The Smipe entered service once more than three months before the second, just in time to prove that it was the best Allied flighten in service. In fact, due to post war financial constraints on RAF re-equipped the Sippould remain in service for another eight years as the RAF's standard post-wa fighter. The Sapiec directly to the Sopwith Salamander, an amped trench lighter (ground attack aircraft). The Salamander's potential was never fully realized since only three were in October of 1918, with another pair reserved for training and the type was quickly withdrawn after the war ended.

## 6 Appendix

### 6.1 Sopwith Schneider

The Sopwith Schneider and Baby both share a common ancestor: the Sopwith float plane that won the 1914S-Schneider Trophy race for England. Performance of this aircraft impressed the Royal Naval Air Service which ordered twelve of the float planes during November of 1914 under the name Schneider.

Like the record breaking float plane, the new machine retained the 100 bp Gnome Monosopage rotary, pioneer has in a angular cowing. The aircraft also retained the wing warping method of lateral control and triangular fan (although a curved fan and allerows were used on late production aircraft). Ammaneit consisted of a 303 Lewis machine gun mounted to fire upward and forward through a cutout in the upper wing. Over the course of its production run, a total of 160 Schelters were built, five of which were retained in service until the first quarter of 1918.

A number of Schelters went to sea, carried aboard Royal Naval Way light crisers. These air air concentrated immediately in attempting to take off from heavy seas which often broke up the wooden floats. A number of others were sent overseas and were used in the Dractables and the eastern Mediterranean. Others were allocated to a number of coastal air stations in England, where one pilot was to record off to three, "Tits" supposed to be

Perhaps the Schneider's place in history rests with its use for takeoff trials from the seaplane carrier CAMMAN on August 1915. For this, the aircraft was first fitted with straightly wheels beneath the floats. The Koeffs were all made from a wooden platform installed on the ship's fondrack. This test was crowed with success, unlike trials from the smaller seaplane carrier BEN-MY-CHEEE conducted some four months

Senior. Since three was no way the aircraft could be landed back on the carrier's deck, all landings had to be made on the sea. Once again, there was difficultly in heavy seas which tended to destroy the floats before the aircraft could be healed aboard the parent vessel.

### 6.2 Sopwith Baby

The Sopwith Baby was a direct development of the Schneider, differing mainly in the lower plant and ramament. The Baby was powered by either a 110 bp of 130 bp Clerget rotary engine housed in the above (inverted Ushaped) cowing.

Ammaneit varied with some aircraft being fitted with an upward and forward firing Lewis gun, while others were fitted with a synchronized forward firing Lewis gun. Two different mountings were used with the forward firing armament, one had the gun mounted to fire over the cowing along the aircraft's center, with the brech projection backward through the windscreen. The other mount had the gun offset to stradward. Additionally, the Baby could carry two sixty-five bound bombs for anti-submarine patrols.

The Sopwith Baby saw wide spread use with the RNAS and was produced under licenses by other British companies including Blackburn and Faircy.

Sopwith 1% Strutter

Designer and built for the British Admiralty, the Sopwith 11's Strutter (which took its name from the arrangement of the upper wing center section W-trut supports) was the first true two-cast fighter to enter service. Powered by 110 h of 130 h/p Clerator tvay engine, the aircraft was armed with a fixed synchronized forward flying Vickers. 303 machine gun and a Lewis. 303 machine gun in the rear cockpit. The 1% Strutter entered service with both the RANS and the Royal Flying Corps, with the former lying both two-user feathers and singles-place bomber variants.

Deliveries of the "Strutter" as the type was more commonly known, began during February of 1916, with the first machines delivered having no fixed forward. It is believed that these aircraft were delivered without the forward gun due to a shortage Vickers. 303 machine gun because of Army demands of the weapons. Some early production aircraft had the observer's 303 Lewis gun mounted on a smaller plant mounting these were later replaced by the "Eleve" mounting and eventually by the standard Scott N.o. 2 ring mount.

A number of these early production aircraft were delivered in time to participate in the grim fighting of the Battle of the Sommer and, although they gave a good account of themselves, by the following year the aircraft had been completely outclassed as a fighter by the more heavily armed and faster German single seat scouts.

A small number were used for Home Defense, with the rear cockpit s faired over. These aircraft were armed with twin Lewis guns on Foster mountings above the upper wing center section. A few others were converted in the field to be flown from the observer's cockpit.

The RANS operated 1% Strutters from ships as reconnaissance and spotter aircraft. The United States Army Air Service Review 11's Strutter, assigning them to the RSN,900 and with Agro Sudarshan Bureau and July of 1918. Still others were flown by the American Expedition Force at winners. The US Naval also found the 1% Strutter from the battlellips US ARIZONA, NEVADA, OKIMOR, PENSIVANIA and TEXAS.

Besides the British and Americans, the 1% Strutter was also flown by France, Belgium and Russia, while small numbers were intended and flown by the Dutch. Reportedly a few aircraft also were delivered to Romania and Japan, where the aircraft saw action against the Russian during 1918.

The 1% Strutter was also built in France in a number of different variants including two seat fighter-reconnaissance aircraft, single seat bomber and two seat bomber. French construction totaled 4,500 aircraft and continued until April of 1918.

## 6.2 Sopwith Pup

Sopwith's next fighter was delivered to "A" Squadron, RNAS which took delivery of the first Sopwith Pup (number 3691) prototype (which was joined by five additional prototypes, numbers 94967 and 9899-9900) for a service evaluation. Both the Royal Flying Corps and Royal Naval Air Service followed this evaluation with large production orders for the aircraft. As a result, the aircraft was sub-contracted to at least four companies in order to meet the demands of the RGC and RNAS. The first production Pup was delivered during September 1976 to the RNAS.

Early production Pups were powered by 80 hC larger rotary engines; however, this engine was quickly replaced by the 80 hC Bc. Rehones rotary which became the standard engine for the Pup. Armanent consisted of a single, 303 Vickers machine gun mounted on the aircraft centering synchronized to fire through the propeller are on the Yup pan introduced into combat by the RNAS during October of 1916 and soon built up an impressive score of victories. Such was the pace of aircraft development at that time, in July the latter sum of 1917, it was recognized that the Pup was rapidly becoming obsolete, despite having distinguished itself during the Battle of Arrasa where it was born by three RNAS squadrons.

With the Pup's ability to maintain attitude, coupled with its maneuverlying (even at altitude), the aircraft was far from finished in squadron serving (except over the Western Front). During the Summer of 1917, two Pup squadrons were moved from France to England for Home Defense duties, while a further two squadrons were formed in the British lies for the same purpose. Most of the Pup sude for Home Defense were modotified with 100 Bp Gnomousousop engines in long chordvolies with featured addition cooling air intakes on the upper tip of the cowling. The increase in power gave these aircraft an improved rate of climb and a slight increase in top speed at altitude. Additionally, a number had their synchronized forward Vickers gun augmented by a fixed 303 Nevin s gun mounted above the upper wing center section; however, this arrangement configuration remained essential and did not become standard.

Other armanent trials centered around fitting the Pup with Le Priour rockets. These were mounted on the interplane starts, with four rockets being carried on each wing. To aid in the rockets, the transparent panels in the upper wing center section were enlarged.

The Pup was also used as a ship board fighter by the RNAS, operating not only from aircraft carries, but also of platforms (usually no more than twenty feet long) fitted to eight crusts. One Pup, flying from the cruiser, HMS YARMOUTH, shot down Zepplin L23 on 21 August 1917. RNAS Pups usually had the fixed Vickers gun replaced by a triped mounted Lewis gun fixed to fire forward and upward through a cutout in the upper wing.

A number of Sopwith Pups were fitted with skid undercarriage instead of wheels for shipboard use. These aircraft were re-designated as the Sopwith 901a. A small number of these were used at caught trails conducted at Hendon during May of 1917, Others were pressed into service for using nearly experiments with flotation bags and with a drop-double conventional underwater that was jessioned before the aircraft was ditched at sea.

The Pup was also used for early trials that had the goal of landing an aircraft on a ship which was under way. During these experiments aboard HMS FURIOUS, Squadron Commander E.H. Dunning, on 2 August 1917, made the first successful landing aboard a ship that was under way. His third attempted on 7 August 1917 was to cost him his life when the Pup went over the side of FURIOUS and he drowned.

After it was withdrawn from front line squadrons in France, the Pup continued in use for a wide spectrum of trials and experiments. Others were used as hacks for officers who were lucky enough to procure one. British ace James McCodden was toilet recall how he used his personal Sopwith Pup in an attempt to intercept German Gotha bombers that were operating at 15,000 feet over Kent during in the Summer of 1917.

The Pup quickly disappeared with the coming of peace and it is believed that the last operational Pups were a pair operated by the United States Navy.

This Sopwith Pup (B2192) of the School of Special Plying at Gosport is believed to have been painted in Black and White stripes. The aircraft appears to be unarmed.

This Pub has the modified cowling indicating it is powered by 1000 Monosouge engine. The aircraft was based at London College/Artificial during 1917. The aircraft in the background is another Pup (48235) which carries a White fuselage band.

## 6.2 Sopwith Triplane

It has been said that the sight of a Sopwith Triplane "oping through its spaces" was guaranteed to send fear into the hearts of German fighter polots. True or not, the Sopwith Triplane is viewed by many to be one of the most successful First World War fighters to emerge from the Kingstone factory.

Sopwith's choice of the unusual triplane configuration was an attempt to produce a highly maneuverable aircraft that would, at the same time, provide a better view from the cockpit than had the earlier Pup. This was achieved by the use of narrow chord wings, which gave a good overall view, while their combined wing area gave a the aircraft plenty of lift.

Construction of the fusecolor was very similar to that of the earlier Sopwith Pup, with the prototype and early production aircraft having an identical tailplane to the Pup (although this was later changed, with a smaller tailplane becoming standard).

The Triplane was powered by either a 110 hp Clergot rotary engine or a 130 hp Clergot (98 rotary engine.

Despite the fine qualities that the Sopwith Triplane embodied, its first appearance was marked by rumors of general structural weakness. One runer said that the wings would just fail to dip in a step? These rumors were atelpity false and were probably inspired by the light breaking of the main planes, although this did not trouble Harry Wakep no the topotropic within minutes of its first takeoff

There is no doubt that the Sopwith Triplane was a remarkable fighting machine, yet only a small number were ever produced, that could be in the region of 130 aircraft. The type was in front line service for no more than seven months, with the first production machines being required by No 1 (NaNa) Squadron, which spent several weeks working at the aircraft before taking into action in early April of 1977. The introduction of the Tripplane by Nos 8, 9 and 10 Seqators of the RNAs restored the balance of power over the Western Front, ending the domination of the Altbands D.II counts. Even with the success of the Triplane in Royal Naval Air Service use, the Royal Flying Corpsdecided to standardize on the Spatz 7 and relinquished their ordered Triplanes to the RNAs in exchange for that service's Spads.

By November of 1971, the career of the Sopwith Triplane was nearling its end. It was not the introduction of a superior enemy aircraft that ended the Triplane's operational but, rather the introduction of the first Sopwith Camel fighters. The Camel carried train, synchronized Vickers machine guns was standard armaraman instead of the Triplane's single Vickers gun (although some late production Triplanes were modified with twin span) and it was the need for heavier flower that led to the Triplane being withdrawn. No 1 Squadron, RNAs was the last unit to replenish the Triplane, finally giving them up at lower in each for Camels during December of 1971.

The best known Sopwith Triplanes were those operated by (originally all Canadian) "B" flight No 10 (NaNa) Squadron. This unit reputation was well described with a set of eight-seven years after hearing destroyed by the famous "Black Flight," The members of this unit bestowed fitting names to their Triplanes including _Black Dwork_, _Black Rinue_, _Black Rinue_ and _Black Rinue_.

The Triplane was modified during February of 1971 with eight-foot tailplanes being substituted for the ten foot squasi planta (as used on the Sopwith Pup). Most Triplanes received the modification as a retrofit carried out at the squadron level. Although the changes significantly improved the control response, aircraft in front line units were some of the last to be modified.

Besides the RNAs, the French Navy also flew the Sopwith Triplanes. At least eight-tera aircraft were delivered to the _Attiation Martinez_ and were used to equip one squadron at Dunkerque.

**This Tribiane, believed to be NS431, saw service at Imbroos and was modified with the addition of a.303 Lewis machine gun to augment the forward firing Vickers machine gun.**

**An RFC pilot prepares to start this Sopworth F.1. Camel which is armed with a single, 203 Vo-keras machine gun. The aircraft is believed to have been attached to a training unit at Cotton, Leicestershire, during 1916.**

Cully's next concern was finding his flotilla again. He found the ships, with less than a pair of fuel remaining in his emergency fuel tank, and successfully ditched his machine near the British thing. Within a short period, his 2F1 Camel was hauled aboard its lighter, loved by HMS REDOUBT.

A number of Navy Camels were fitted with special devices for shipboard use. These included jetsinable undercharges made from steel tubing, clips mounted on the undercarriage spreader bar to engage carrier arresting wires, and propeller guards to protect the properclaring a nosover landing.

After the war the car canal was rapidly phased out of service and replaced by the Sopworth Snipe and only two Camels, both F.1s, were placed on the British Civil Register.

**American Sopworth Camels**

During August of 1918 a number of Sopworth F.1 Camels were carmarked for service with the United States Air Service. At least sixty-six were drawn from British stocks and issued to the 17th Zero Squadron.

The United States Navy is also known to have had at least six F.1 Camels. Two were aboard USES TXEAS and one was allocated to USES ARKANSAS. One aircraft (A-5721) and possibly others had a hydrone mounted in front of the main landing gear and Grain flotation equipment mounted beneath the fronts of the lower longrons.

**The upper wing of this Camel F.1 (B7360) was painted to represent the Egyptian god Behout. The aircraft was the 1.000th aircraft of the Russian Prostore production line, being deferred on a January 1918. The Camel carried the name Ruaston Proctor on the cow coming in Black.**

## 6.2 Sopwith Snipe

With the pace of aircraft advancement during the First World War, it was only a matter of time before the Sopwith Camel would be outcast as a fighter. With this in mind, Sopwith began work on a replacement during mid-1917 It was decided early on that the new aircraft would use the same Bentley rotary engine that was employed in the later variants of the Camel.

The first prototype of the new machine was built during the Summer of 1917 and was followed by an additional five pre-production aircraft. The first two prototypes of the fighter fighter are borne at spring limitty of the Camel having single bay using a slabed fuselage and a distinctly Camel-like fin and rudder. The third prototype featured redesigned vertical slit surfaces and a faired in fuselage. The wings were changed to a two bay interchange strut configuration with a 4 foot 3 inch increase in wing span over the first two prototypes.

Armament originally consisted of a pair of 303 Vickers machine guns with 750 rounds per wind to fire forward and a Lewis machine gun with 250 pounds mounted to pivot upward. Later, the Lewis was scheduled from production aircraft and the standard armament became a pair of forward firing Vickers guns.

For its time, the spine was, by single seat standards, a large and powerful aircraft. PhotIS graduating to it from the smaller Camel described the change as like driving a track after having a sports car. Deliverations of production aircraft began during the Summer of 1918 shortly after the formation of the Royal Air Force (April of 1918). No 43 Squadron, RAF was the first unit to be equipped with the appe and made their initial operational sorting on 23 September 1918. The fin and rudder of these production variants was considerably larger than the prototypes. This was done to restore lateral control to the aircraft after it was found to suffer badly from the torque of the 230 hp Bentley engine.

The Snipe featured a number of advanced items as standard equipment including oxygen and electrical heating. For eight flying, navigation lights could be fitted which proved useful for the Snipes retained for Home Defense which interceptions. These night-figures also carried flares under the lower wing tips. Snipe pilots were to use the Guardian Engel type parachute, which necessitated a special compartment be added to the fuselage docking for the stowage of the parachute canopy; however, the war ended before this modification could be introduced on production aircraft.

Shortly after No 43 Squadron on re-equipped with Snipes, they were issued to No 4 Squadron of the Australian Flying Corps. Only one other squadron re-equipped with the Snipe before the Armiscio, No 285 Squadron, RAF. Four other squadations, Nos 37,78, 112 and 143 were not re-equipped with Snipes until after the war ended. These squadations received late production aircraft which were modified with an enlarged fin and rudder, revised horizontal tail surfaces and inversely tapered, horn-balanced aiternes. These modifications improved the aircraft's control responses which had not been considered completely satisfactory by service pilots.

The most famous Snipe was the aircraft (E8102) flow by MAJ W. G. Barker while attached to No 201 Squadron, RAF, a Camel squadron. Ten days after being attached to the unit, on 27 October 1918, Barker was on patrol over the Western Front and engaged an enemy two-seater which he destroyed. In this engagement the sustaining a wound in the thigh from a burst fired by the pilot of a Fokker D.VII. This caused him to spin down, pulling out with the middle of a formation of some fifteen Fokker D.VI. Its histone down despite receiving a second wound in the left elbow. Again he fainted and when he came to, he found himself in with another group of Folkers. He shot one down before being wounded a third time in the left elbow which once more caused him to lose consciousness from the pain.

When he regained consciousness, Barker found himself the target of a fresh memory formation. He managed to send one of his attackers down in flames before diving away. After Denosing through another enemy formation the crash handed just inside the British Uns. On 30 November, Barker was sufficiently recovered from his wounds to receive the Victoria Cross from King George V at Buckingham Palace. His Snipe was recovered and the fuselage of this aircraft is preserved in Canada.

With the end of the First World War, the Sopwith Snipe became the standard post-war RAFT fighter. The Snipe served with Nos 2, 17, 19, 23, 22, 32, 34, 56 and 111 Squadrons, with a total of 1600 aircraft using produced a number of post-Swipes where to see active services abroad, including those of Nos 25 and 56 Squadrons which deployed to Turkey during 1922 at the time of the Canada crisis. Other Snipes were used in Iraq, mainly in the ground attack to against relt between during 1925.

In addition to the single-eat Snipe, an unarmed two-seat variant was also produced to serve as an operational transit and most fighter squadands had one or two on strength. The majority of the two-seaters, however, served at the Central Flying School and with No 1 and 2 Flying Training Schools.

At the time of the Armiscio, a revised variant of the standard single-seat Snipe was being developed. This aircraft, designated the Snipe has, instead for the long-range escort for role we by the Independent Air Force. The Smipe Ia featured a large fuel tank installed beneath the pilot's seat. With the increased fuel supply the aircraft's endurance was extended to four and one half hours. The rearward shift in the center of gravity was compensated for by giving the wings a slight sweepback.

**E8102 was the Sopwith 7F.1 Snipe flow by MAJW. G. Barker during the engagement on 27 October 1918 that won him the Victoria Cross. The aircraft was salvaged following the fight and the fuselage is still preserved in Canada.**Had the war lasted, the Snipe was envisioned, by the RAF, as being the replacement aircraft for all the Sopwith Camel variants in use, including those used as shipboard lightures. Just before the war ended, one Snipe was fitted with reitsitsubable wheels and a hydrostore to be used for dificing trials. About this same time, another pair was reportedly allocated to the Royal Navy for service with the Grand Fleet.

The end of the war did not immediately put an end to the use of the Snipe in the naval role. During 1919, on the Snipe was fitted with Houston gear under the front of the lower longens and slinging equipment above the using center section. Three years later, another Snipe was set aside for testing carrier deck landing techniques.

There was little use of the Snipe outside the RAF, although five aircraft were briefly entered on the British Civil Register and three were entered for the Aerial Derby of 1920.

Additionally, a number of Snipes were sent abroad. One of these, 2813, was intended to be donated to Canada by the city of Licester, England, during February of 1919. But before the presentation could take place, the aircraft was located to H. G. Quigley for use in the Toronto to New York Air Race. In the event, it crashes on 2.5 August, before the race. Atleast one Snipe was used by the U.S. Air Service at McCowKeld. Then are two known surviving Snipes in North America, one of these having survived as a result of its use in early Hollywood motion pictures.

This Snipe (P2330) of 208 Squadron is a late production aircraft which featured horn balanced upper allerdings. The aircraft has a locally produced modification, a small conical shaped propeller splinner.

The three White fusuge bands identify this Snipe (E8057) as being assigned to No 70 Squadron at Bickendorf. The stripes around the Gray cowling are also in White. This is an early production aircraft with the early stugfe fin and rudder and plain upper allerons.

## 6.2 Sopwith Salamander

Had it not been done by an unreliable engine, the Sopwith Dragon, a re-engined variant of the Snipe, was to have been the standard post-war RAF fighter. In the event, the Dragon never entered service, however, Sopwith was more successful with another variant of the Snipe, a flat-sleged ground attack aircraft named the TF2. Salamander. The TF2 Salamander was intended to be a follow-on to the earlier Camel TF1-ground attack aircraft (The TF designation standing for French Fighter) and replace the word in time by the same 230 Bentley name cylinder rotary engine (with the 200D Cigerget specified as an alternative engine) as the Sipe and the same general appearances the earlier fighter.

The aircraft was armed with a pair of 303 Vickers forward firing machine guns with 1,0800 rounds per pen. The signs were mounted in a staggered arrangement with the start-board pen being some three inches ahead of the port weapon. This was done to allow the amminution boxes to be installed side by side across the full width of the fuselage.

This was the second named configuration, an earlier folder of a moving a pair of 303 Lewis guns pointing downward at about 45 degrees having been abandoned. Additionally, the Salamander carried four twenty-five pound Cooper bomb on under fuselage rock. Over the course of its development, the Salamander was used to test a number of amminents, including one Salamander that was experimentally fitted with an arm of eight downward firing Lewis machine guns.

RAF experience with the dangerous mission of ground attack, where service figures had suffered almost thirtypert losses, led to the addition of some 605 pounds of armor plate on all sides of the cockpit, fuel tank and the installation of an armored headset behind the cockpit. The front plane was that thick, the side plates were 60 and the botpante was 118th thick. The rear wall was made of a six gauge plate over a ten gauge plate forming a double plate wall.

The Salamander differed from the Snipe in having a slab sided fuselage, fixed horizontal tail surfaces and the tapered armored headset behind the cockpit. Late production Salamanders had the same bomb balanced alteors and enlarged in front and druder found on the late production Snipe.

The first prototype Salamander was sent overseas during early May of 1918 for an operational publication. This evaluation was highly successful and the Salamander was ordered into production on a very large scale. By the end of October the RAF and thirty-seven one, although only two of these were in use over the Western Front. The RAF planned to equip four squadations with the Salamander, Nos 86, 96, 157 and 158 and Nos 96 and 157 had begun to re-equ with the eye when the other ended. Production continued after the war, well into the Summer of [1919] by which time more than 200 aircraft had been produced (many aircraft were reportedly put into long term storage after the war).

With its Herpower, top speed of 125 mph and maneuverability, the potential shown by the Salamander was such that it was proposed that the aircraft he adopted as the standard post-war RAF fighter. In the event, another Sopwith product, the Snipe, was chosen for this led and no RAF squadron was equipped with Salamanders as its sole equipment.

One of the reasons the Salamander was rejected was a problem with warped armor plate. A lack of proper inspection and supervision of the armor plate being made for use on the Salamander led to a number of aircraft being built with warped armor. This, in turn, led to a misalignment of the fuselage, wings and tail plane. The misalignmented to serious control problems, rendering a number of aircraft unsafe for flight. This problem affects all the aircraft built and was not resolved until late 1919, although by that time it was no longer important.

The type was quickly withdrawn after the war, although a number of camourlaged Salamanders were sent to Egyptian during 1922, no doubt as a result of the Chanan crisis. This crisis was sufficiently serious for at least one British newspaper to carry the headline "Wor Almost inevitable."

One Salamander, F633, was tested by the U.S. Air Services at McCook Field. The aircraft was carried on U.S. Army rolls until October of 1926.

**Fig602**, was one of 160 T-2 Salamanders constructed at the Sopworth factory at Ham. The primary external difference between the Salamander and Sipe was the slab-sided fusage of the Salamander.

It is believed that this is either an early production Salamander or one of the prototypes, as indicated by the small fan and rudder fitted to early aircraft. The fin and rudder were enlarged on production aircraft.
