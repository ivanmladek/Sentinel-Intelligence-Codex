performance carrier based day fighter in the Spring of 1948. McDomell was one of the six firms which responded to the Navy, with a total of eleven designs being submitted. Eventually the Navy chose the McDomell design, Model 58, along with the Douglas entry, for development.

The new McDomell design was a radical departure from the straight winged Plantmont and Bankbe. The design team, under Richard Deagan, came up with a fighter which incorporated as much aeroulent technology as was possible in their attempt to develop superior fighter. The single engine was placed in a slack, pointed fuscheg with a swept wing and all, A clean, aerodynamic shape was emphasized and the mockup was ready for inspection in the Summer of 1948. Official were basically happy with what they saw, although some revision in the basic design was necessary. This included such to cut down on weight and better access to the engine. Following these changes, work began on the prototype, now designated the XFMI-1, which was completed in early 1951.

Unfortunately, Westinghouse ran into serious problems with its new engine. Originally the XFMI-1 was to have been equipped with the A0-W-8, but this was changed to the more 1948 output-wide-10, but neither engine was available to equip the prototype. As a result a non-atherthing, lowerened H0-WE-6 was substituted for flight tests until either the 8 or 10 new ready for installation.

Despite misgiving about this underpowered engine McDomell engineers began taxi tests with the XFMI-1. In July of 1951, The first flight of the aircraft took place on 7 August 1951 when McDomell's chief test pilot, Robert Leahon, took off from Lambert Field. Due to the engine problem, however, company officials decided to carry out flight tests over Kansas rather than in 8. Louis. This first prototype (Buo 125444) drew for six months before. Second aircraft (Buo 125444) was ready for testing in January of 1952, equipped with the 6 engine. During flight tests the low power of the 6 became even more obvious. In addition it was **The XFMI-1 prototype**, now called the Demon, takes to the air from Lambert Field in 8. Louis. Early tests showed that the Demon was underpowered, especially since it was forced to use a non-atherthing Westinghouse J40-WE-6 until the anticipated 340-WE-6 was ready. (**ldomell-Douglas**)

proved to be unreliable at high altitude and the aircraft's handling characteristics suffered. Reposition of the control surfaces provided some relief, but the main problem continued to be the engine. In August of 1952, over safer the first flight, the 40-WE-8 was finally ready for installation and both prototypes were pulled out of service to be re-engined.

The first flight with the new engine took place during January of 1953 and flight testing began afterwards. Even with the new engine the aircraft was still underpowered, and the engine proved to be mechanically unreliable, which resulted in numerous groundings. Despite problems the XFMI-1, now called the Demon, in keeping with McDomell's ability of using "good" type names, proved to handle well except at high altitudes. To solve this problem modifications were made to the wings. Late that summer, the Demon was obtained ready for Carrier Qualification trials, which were conducted on USS CORAL SEA (CVA-A3). Aside from the power problem the only major concern was the lack of forward visibility when landing. To solve this, the nose and cockpit would be tilted downward five degrees on production aircraft.

By this time the Navy had changed its requirements and the production versions would differ greatly from the two prototypes. These continued to be used for flight tests but the first XFMI-1 suffered an inflight fuel explosion in March of 1954, resulting in its complete destruction. Following this, it was decided to cancel further tests with the remaining prototype due to safety considerations and a feeling that no additional information could be gained.

The second Demon was promoted within a short period, scrapped.

The second Demon prototype is reactified for a scrapped launch from the USS CORAL SEA (CVA-A3) in late 1953. The tests, while not encouraging, showed that the Demon did have **potential. Its most glimp medium was its lack of power**. In addition, the view during **moving was less than adequate and led to a revised nose on production aircraft. In the background was another aircraft which was also plagued by a lack of power, the Douglas P4D Skyr. (**Mcomell-Douglas**)

## F3H-1N

As originally intended the Demon was to have been a clear weather carrier fighter. When the first XF3H-11 rolled out of the factory in early 1951 it reflected this concept, but the Navy decided to change the aircraft's mission to that of an all-weather interceptor with multi-role capabilities under the designation F3H-1N. Due to engine problems the Navy decided to use the more powerful J40-W-2 to 10 minutes in place of the J40-W-E, which resulted in a change in the final flagging design along with an increase in weight. Additional weight was added when it was realized that the low gear needed to be strengthened. The nose itself was also enlarged to handle the larger Westinging APD-50 radar which gave the Demon is all-weather capability. The redesigned Demon also replaced the manually folding wings with hydunlumally operated ones because of problems with the annual stay fold.

The results of all these changes was a large rise in overall weight which translated into a speed for more power, which in turn required more fuel. The only way this could be accomplished was to enlarge the fuselge for additional fuel storage which changed the original sketch design. As a result, the new aircraft took on a more pottly profile. Due to the Korean War the Navy decided to place an order for the new aircraft even though testing the pro-processing was not yet completed. In addition, the production engine was not, a yet, fully proven. In March of 1951 McDonnell received a contract for 150 aircraft, while an additional order for the **F3H-1N was a big aircraft for its day, having dimensions very close to that of a later McDonnell design, the F4 Phantom. The drastic difference between the XF3H-1- and the F4H-1N was the result of a mission change by the Navy and the need for a bigger engine and more fuel. As a result, the sleek look of the original Demon gave way to a more pottly and less angular looking aircraft, ( McDonnell-Douglas)**

types had been completely tested and all the problems worked out. Finally, the Demon was a tremendous step forward in terms of Navy fighter development and as such pioneered new ground. This ambitious program suffered in part due to the very advances the aircraft sought to achieve since it tried to achieve so much so fast. Had the development time been longer and had the original engine been ready when it was supposed to have been, and achieved its power output, many of the Demon's early problems would never have occurred. When coupled with the aircraft's change in mission during its initial design and construction it is remarkable that the F3H was eventually able to get into production and service.

## F3h-2n

The problems which arose from the Westinghouse engines early in the Demon program caused the McDonnell design team to look for another power plant to replace the J40. Although initially the Navy felt that this was not needed, when the J40-WE-8 failed to live up to expectations, it came around to McDonnell's point of view. R. J. Baldwin, now in charge of the program at McDonnell, selected the Allison J71 as a possible alternative to the J40. In early 1954 four production line aircraft were modified to take the Allison engine. Two of these served as J71 powered F3H-1N test aircraft, while the other two were used as prototypes for the next production version, designated the F3H-2N.

The first flight of the Allison equipped F3H-2N took place on 11 January 1955. The difference between the F3H-1N test with the J40 and the Allison equipped F3H-2N was substantial. While the J71 was not trouble-free, it was a tremendous improvement over the three-slable and undeproverged Westinghouse engine. The increase in high altitude performance, in particular, was impressive. Additionally, there were a number of other significant changes between the F3H-1N and the F3H-2N. Early models of the F3H-2N had a one-piece windscreen but early in the production this was changed to a more conventional three-piece design during February of 1955, shortly after the loss of the first F3H-2N prototype. Three was coincident that this loss was due to the failure of the windscreen and it was decided to switch the stronger three-piece type. Early aircraft were eventually retrofitted with the newer design windscreen.

One of the early problems with both the XF3H-1, and the F3H-1N was the increase in overall weight which further degraded the aircraft's performance since the original engines were already undeproverpowered. In order to compensate for the increase in overall weight, the wing area was increased by 17.5 percent. This was done by extending the tailing edge of the wing rotor forty inches, then extending the trailing edge of the wing out to the wing tip. This helped offset some loss in performance due to the weight gain, and improved the aircraft's overall handling characteristics.

Another problem which switched early in the F3H-2N career was using warrage, which resulted when a plot put to the aircraft through a high speed roll maneuver. This warrage then reflected the overall aircraft's performance and could only be corrected by the pilot applying anlor adjustment, resulting in additional drag and loss of fuel due to the compensation. While the easiest solution would have been to be yet up the wing structure, this would have led to a major increase in weight for the already undeprovered Demon. Instead, it was decided during 1956, to add wing spoilers to the upper wings which spread the stress out over a large rate of the wing. This solved the wing warp problem and helped the aircraft's roll rate at high speeds.

The F3H-2N also received several modifications internally at the factory and in service to improve its performance. Initially the Demon had been equipped with the Westinghouse APD-50 all-weather radar. This was later changed to the Hughes APQG-51 which offered their acquisition capabilities. The original ramament of the aircraft was four 20MM commands which were located below and behind the intakes. Due to their weight, four of these guns were often removed to increase performance. In addition it was discovered that when the new were fired at high altitude, the ingestion of gun gases caused the engines to stall. Eventually, when missiles became an integral part of its ramament, squadoms often removed all four guns and relied solely on missiles for armament. On early models the cannons were supplemented by Mighty Mouse folding fin aircraft rockets (VFARS) which were carried on the four underving hardpoints. These unguided rockets relied on the volley effect, saturating the target area with a lethal stream of missiles, any one of which could destroy or disable an enemy aircraft. In 1956 these were replaced with the early AAM-N-7 Sidewander infrared guided (net seeking) air-to-air guided missiles.

One of the more serious problems which played the Demon during its early service was flame-ous in rainy weather or under marginal weather conditions, a serious impediment for an all-weather fighter. Eventually, it was found that the turbine blades were rubbing on the engine casing, resulting in the problem. To solve the problem, the blades were milled down a small amount which rectified the problem and allowed the Demon to operate in all types of weather.

Externally, aside from the increase in wing area and the change in windscreen there were relatively few changes in the Demon's external configuration. A removable refacing probe was fitted to the right side of the fuselage just behind the pilot for in-flight refueeting. Various underings were reset for ordinance and external fuel tanks. It was found that the addition of external tanks did not help increase range endurance due to their drag and, in fact, reduced it. As a result, external tanks were not popular and saw only limited use. In 1957, the last significant outward change for the Demon occurred when the original flat topped "bever tail" was shortened and tapered. In 1962, under the new Department of Defense aircraft designation system, the F3H-2N became the F-3C.

Canopy Development

The first production F24-28 sits on the flight line prior to a test hop. From this angle on the ground, the visibility through the one piece uniderement is apparent. The cages on the intake and fuselage side are to keep out debris during start up which could be ingested by the engine and cause various damage to the turbine blades. Early aircraft used for flight tests carried a large test probe on the nose. (McDonnell-Dooplas)

Due to the problems with the early -1N Demon design, the decision was made to substitute the more reliable and powerful Allison 71. To help improve performance due to the weight gain caused by the various modifications, the wing area was increased by 17.5 per secondly extending the trailing edge of the wing back forty inches, then extending to at the wing tip. This helped to increase performance and handling which had deteriorated sharply due to the increase in weight. The difference in the wing area can easily be seen between the Gray F24-28 and Blue F34-18. Both are fitted with the one piece frontween which was later deleted when the original F34-28 prototype was lost when the windscreen chintegrated in flight. (McDonnell-Dooplas)

Carrier qualifications for the F3M-2N were conducted on board USG TICONDEROOA (CVA-14) during the second week of September, 1555. This F3M-2N (BuNo 3559) was used for these tests and nearly two dozen findings and students were conducted along with check handling and stawage evaluations.

With the apparent problems of the Demon solved, the Navy and McDonnell geared up for full production. Early production 73R-2R+s are being assembled at the McDonnell St. Louis facility during 1956.

Unlike the Demon, the XV-1 did not progress beyond the prototype stage. (McDonnell-Douglas)

When the Navy changed the mission requirements for the F3H, one of the jobs envisioned for the Denoma was that of a fleet at defense missile intercore. Designed the F3H-2M M for missile/his variant of the Denoma was developed in parallel to the F3H-2M. Initially this model was to be equipped with the AAM-N-2 Spurnov I which was a new beam riding rather guided at-u-at missile. Aside from the associated launch equipment and wiring, the F3H-2M carried a modified radar run, the APC-518,0 had the large missile. Eventually, however, it was decided to switch from the Spurnov I to the Spurnov II thick used a semi-active radar homing system when was far more effective than the carrier missile.

In addition to the Spurnov, the F3H-2M could also carry the AM-N-7 Sideswarter like the carrier F3H-2M. Though the F3H-2M could carry up to four Spurnov, it was more common for them to carry up towards and two Sideswarters to allow the aircraft to do deal with a variety of threats. In some cases, two of the four internal 20MM common were deleted to save weight and improve performance. In some situations, all four Spurn was removed when the only mission planned for the fighter was long range fleet at defense.

The first flight of the F3H-2M took place in the Time Summer of 1958, with flight and ramament testing beginning in line fall. It would be almost a year; however, until the F3H-2M went into service with front-line units. Once it began to be phased in, the F3H-2M became the mainstay of fleet defense units until replaced by the very aircraft it helped sirc; the McDonnell F4H Phantom. In 1962 under the DOD revised designation system the F3H-2M became the MF-3B.

## Advanced Demon

Design

As the basic F3H design was refined, McDonnell began work on an improved series of variants. These were based in general to the Demon, but with more powerful engines, sophisticated electrodes and enhanced load carrying capabilities. Some of these designs were proposed beyond the conceptual state, while two, similar in general outline, progressed to the mock-q stage. These variations were broken down in the following manner:

F3H-C: This was basically an F3H-2 with a General Electric 167 engine and an increase in overall wing area. Anticipated performance and speed was to be superior to the F3H, particularly as the altitude increased. Top ceiling was expected to increase by approximately one mile.

F3H-E: Built around the 367 engine, this version featured a designed fussile similar for the Gramma F11F, and a new wing. Its anticipated performance would have been metter at altitude than either the F2H-2N or F3H-C. In particular its rate of climb would be almost double shot shot of the F3H-2.

F3H-G: Basically a new design, this model had two General Electric 165 engines. While performance was much improved over the F3H-2, it was similar in performance to the F3H-C but inferior in most cases to the F3H-E.

F3H-H: Similar to the -G Model, this version was to have been fitted with two General Electric -79x which would have increased overall performance dramatically over all the other proposals. The F3H-G/H proposals and mock-up showed a great deal of promise. The general design was to have served as the basis for a wide family of variants including a dry interceptor, a dry attack fighter, an all-counter integrator, an all-counter attack fighter, an ECM platform and a two-place version which could be used for a multitude of missions. Each variant was to have carried different types of armament, missiles, electronics, and radar. Though was given to making the notes interchangeable rather then produce complete aircraft for each mission requirement. Since the entire program never got beyond the mock-up stage, this never progressed beyond the planning stages.

In looking at the F3H-G/H design, however, one is struck by the similarities between it and McDonnell's next production aircraft, the F4 Phantom. It is reinvolger this is perhaps the greatest contribution in the Demon track, for it served as the site for one of the most important and profile jets of the 1960s and 1970s. Undoubtedly, lessons learned from the Demon power were put to use in the design of the F4- and it is probably safe to say that if it had not been for the F3H, the Phantom as it eventually evolved would have been much different, if it would well have seen the light of day. If served as a bridge between the, straight windized at the early years of jet propulsion and the modern, high-tech wandering pione-mined by the F4- and its various success. Although it never fulfilled the original high thrust is it was intended to have, it nevertheless gave a good account of itself during its lifetime and left behind a successor which still flies today, a legacy of which its designes can be broad.

**The wooden mock-up of the F3H-G/H was put on display at the St. Louis facility during its 1954. McDonnell hoped to use newer, more powerful engines to take the basic Demon design much further then the original model was able to progress. A series of inter-campaneable noses, different armaments and electronics would give the new design for greater versatility. (McDonald Douglas)

## Into Service

Following flight tests and carrier qualifications the first F3H-2Ns began to reach fighter units when VF-14 Top Hatterers, and other Atlantic context great standards received their Demors during March of 1956. The first Pacific coast Demon fleet squadron, VF-124 Monowners, received their F3H-2Ns shortly afterwards in May. VF-124 plots were aimed in this transition by VC-3, a composite timing squadron which acquired their Demons in the early spring of 1995. By the end of the year, four additional fleet units, VF-31, VF-1, VF-82 and VF-112 had made the transition to the F3H-2N Demon.

During 1995 and early 1995 these and other units worked up to operational status with their Demons. In the Summer and Fall of the year VF-14, VF-124 and VF-122 made the first carrier or deployments with the Demon, VF-14 going on 2.4 cruise aboard the US FORRESTAL (CVA-59) while VF-124 and VF-122 made WPes (Western Pacific) evokes on the USENIXON (CVA-16) and USENIXON-HOSOKA (CVA-14). VF-122 was one of the four new best quadrants, cf., which we equipped in the IDrano ding 1957, and a variety of operations were carried out during this initial deployment of the Demon. VF-61, the second Atlantic unit, took part in a interesting NATO ocean crossing exercise and made the first F3H landing on a foreign carrier, the British carrier HMS MAXOVA, during the full of 1957. The unit also became the first to deploy with the new Sparrow air-to-air missile and the **The first Fleet unit to receive the Demon was VF-14 Top Hatterers, an Atlantic Fleet squadron.

In 1958, seven quadrons were equipped with the Demon, two in the Atlantic, and four in the Pacific, although one of the Pacific units had resulted from the merger of another Demon unit. VF-124, to form the Pacific Fleet Replacement Air Group (RAG) VF-121. This year was to prove interesting in that the FM received its first heparin of fire, so to speak, in both the Pacific and Mediterranean. In the early spring the Black Angels of VF-122 aboard US. TOOSPROGA (CVA-14) flow combat airports (CAP) in the South China Sea as tension between Comnulation and Nationalt Clinin increased. Though no serial action occurred, Red Chinese MoFs were splited on a number of occasions and the unit took part in a strike against a ground target.

Hall af world away, in the Mediterranean, VF-31 Demons from the USS SARATOGA (CVA-60) provided air over for U.S. Marine and Army forces over Lebanon when American knows were requested by the Lebanese government to help it against internal turnear and outside pressure from the United Arab Republic (UAR), a union of Syria and Egypt. Additionally, a health result from high waich was the murder of the monarch, further pushed the Lehanese government to ask for foreign troops to safeguard to position. A Marines stormed above, Demons and other Navy jets fle over cover are there were serious concerns that Syria might throw its MoFs and Russian tanks into the fraid political station. The strong reaction by the U. S., Britain, and France; however, proved to be a powerful determent and by early Fall the situation not stabilized. No aerial combat took place and although Syrian aircraft were spotted on radar, none were over actually encountered.

During 1959, one new Atlantic squadron VF-41 Black Aces was formed but one of the early Atlantic Demon units, VF-61, was decommissed. Despite being a new F3H spankree VF-41 took the evoved "topgan" troply for being the best all weather fighter squachtoring the annual weapons competition held at the Yuma Marine Corps Air Station (MCAS) late inThe Navy was the only service to place the Demon in squadron service although an attempt was made to perform the Fair in Marine Corps markings.

that year. In the Pacific, four quadrants received the Demon, VF-92, VF-141, VF-151 and VF-213. All of these quadrants except VF-92 mentioned from the Douglas FAD Sky Skyursive VF-92 traded in another McDonal aircraft, the F2H88, fingers, for Demons. In the November of that year the last Fild middle of the McM-on assembly line, the final production figures for all variants of the Demon being 519. During 1960 and 1961 only two new Demon quadrants were added to the fleet, VF-161 (1960) and VF-13 (1961) both in the Atlantic. Two units, both Pacific, retired their FMI. One V-112, was redesignated and attack until art- equipped with North American FJ Furjes, while the other, VF-141, transitioned to the FA92 Phantom, the first Pacific squadron to do, so, Another unit VF-14, won the Battle "E" and Safety "S" award the third year in a new, only squadron to ever accomplish this. By this time the Demon was beginning to show its age as never aircraft such as the F-14 Phantom and F-8 Crasadro came into the inventory. In 1962a/or in order to avoid confusion, various aircraft were designated under a new DOD designation system. For the Demon menu, most that the F3H-2 became the F3H-32 become the F3-B, the F3H-28 N become the F-3C, and the F3H-28 became the MF-3B. Another two quadrants formed in their Demons for Thant year. The Demon pilots of VF-13, VF-37 and VF-10 also took part in the Caban Missic Crisis in the Fall of the year. As of the next decade of Caban's Me-57-13 and VF-13H of new the USS.

This star was mounted due to the uncertainty as to whether or not the I2-88 were equipped with nuclear weapons and the tension during this time was substantially high. Fortunately, the crisis was solved peacefully through negotiations, but for a number of weeks the whole world watched with bailed breath as the two superpowers stood on the brink of nuclear war.

By 1963, only seven brief syndoms were still equipped with the F3H, three in the Atlantic (VF-14, VF-31 and VF-13) and four in the Pacific (VF-54, VF-151, VF-161 and VF-123). By the end of the year four of these units had switched or were in the process of transition to the "deal", delivering VF-13, VF-161 and VF-213 bring the Demon. The Demon's last "conject-bat" works close in November when Flight of VF-213 from the USS HANOCK (CVA-19) provided air cover as American civilians were evacuated from Sigion, South Vietnam following a bloody coup again President Negon Dem, the head of South Vietnam, which led to its execution. This was the swan song of the Demon's operational life. With the Pattonen and Crascador now the Navy first filter lightsense, the F3-dsays were numbered. In the Atlantic V-143 trad in its Demons for Crascades in early dynamic while on the West cost, VF-161 and VF-213 transmitted to the F-4.
