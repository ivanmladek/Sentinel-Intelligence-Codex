## Supermarine Spitifire (Griffons)

Mks.XIV and XVIII

by Len Bachelor

THE combination of the Spitifire and the Rolls-Royce Griffon aero-engine had already proved successful and operationally acceptable with the introduction of the Spitifire Mk.XII which used a Mk.V airframe for its development.

Meanwhile, a major redesign of the Spitifire was planned. This would use the Griffon engine and exploit the Mk.VIII airframe with a new mainplane. In due course this redesign was to appear as the Type 394 Mk.XVIII.

However, long before the new fighter appeared there was an operational demand in 1943, for an improved Spitifire capable of greater performance at higher altitudes.

To meet this demand, yet another interim type was evolved by the mating of a Mk.VIII airframe and the Griffon engine. The result was the Type 379 Spitifire Mk.XIV.

As had been the case with the Spitifire Mk.IX, built as a "stand in" for, but in larger numbers than, the Mk.VIII, so the Mk.XIV was built in greater numbers than the Mk.XVIII.

## Pre-production Spitifire XIVs

Six Mk.VIII airframes, serialized JF316-321 were taken from the production line and used as conversion and development aircraft.

**JF316.** Converted at the Hursley Park works from whence it went to Rolls-Royce's aerodrome at Hucknall (Nottinghamshire) in April 1943 for propeller tests at low altitude with the Griffon 65 and 67 engines. Following these tests, it was returned to Vickers at Eastleigh near Southampton (Hampshire) in April 1944, and finally on to de Havilland Propellers Ltd. In 1948, JF316 finished its useful role at Sutton-on-Hull (E. Yorkshire) where it was burned in Royal Air Force fire-fighting tests.

**JF317.** Powered by a Griffon RG5SM (a pre-production development Griffon with a slightly lower supercharger gear ratio than the subsequent production Griffon 65); modified fin and rudder; Mk.VIII wing, without extended wingings (and small-span airfoms as on the Mk.VII); and with "balloon"-type* cockpit hood, JF317 was evaluated by A&AEE--the Aeroplane & Armament Experimental Establishment--at Boscombe Down, near Salisbury (Wiltshire). The take-off weight for test purposes was 8,375 pounds; and the following observations are extracted from the official A&AEE report (reproduced by permission of the Controller ofH.M. Stationery Office; Crown Copyright Reserved).

When taxying with an open hood, stated the A&AEE report, the pilot was unable to put his head out of the cockpit because of a considerable amount of heat and exhaust fumes being blown back by the propeller slipstream.

Take-off length was short but there was a tendency to swing to starboard as the throttle was opened. However, this swing to the right could be controlled without difficulty by applying rudder and full left trim.

For the Mk.XIV, the stalling speeds were similar to those of other Spifire marks. Calibrated indicated airspeed (IAS) measurements amounted to 88 miles per hour IAS with flaps and main undercarriage "up" (retracted) and 75 mph IAS with flaps and main gear in the "down" position.

If controls were applied quickly in an aileron turn, a yawing oscillation occurred.

The rudder was "heavy" and very difficult to hold in a fixed position at high speed.

With an "engine on" approach for landing, the aircraft could be brought in at around 85 mph, IAS.

In September 1943, JF317 was "loaned" to Rolls-Royce for tests with the Griffon 65; and, in June 1944, to RotoI Ltd. for their propeller tests.

**JF318.** Also flight tested at A&AEE between May 20 and September 25, 1943, after conversion by Air Service Training Ltd. at Hamble in Hampshire.

After 104 hours flying and 101 flights, the Griffon RG5SM engine failed. A replacement engine was fitted which also failed after 47 hours flight time and 54 flights. On the last flight, on September 25, the pilot baled-out successfully but the aircraft was "written-off" after making landfall near Amesbury in Wiltshire. The accident investigation revealed that a connecting-rod had fractured and broken through the crankcase on the port side; and that the main big and bearing had overheated.

During the period of trials, which included stability and carbon monoxide contamination tests, JF318 was flown at take-off weights of 8,160 lb.; 8,200 lb. and 8,270 lb.

For take-off at maximum power with 2,750 revolutions per minute, a boost of 12 pounds per square inch was required. This increased to 15 lb./sq.in. for combat level flight and climb. In flight, if the throttle was opened too rapidly, the engine would "splitter"--a rather disconcerting experience to any pilot unaware of this characteristic.

**JF319.** The prototype Mk-XIV with Griffon RG5SM engine. Also went to A&AEE for flight tests. Between which included climb and level performance, position error, oil cooling and radiator suitability trials between September and November 1943. A "universal" wing with gun ports and muzzles sealed; "balloon" hood; modified fin and rudder (similar to JF317); and a highly polished finish.

For the performance trials, JF319 was flown at a take-off weight of 8,400 lb. and +18 lb./sq.in. boost--in combat maximum boost was only permitted for periods of five minutes. The best climbing speed was 175 mph up to 22,000 feet. But this decreased by 3 mph per 1,000 ft. thereafter. Time taken to climb to 10,000 feet was 2:3 minutes; 20,000 ft. in 5:1 min.; 30,000 ft. in 8:35 min. and to 40,000 ft. in 15:05 min. Absolute ceiling was 44,600 feet.

Taxying was found to be similar to that experienced with JF317. Short bursts of power were found to be more preferable than a steady flow of low power. This was due to the fact that the engine did not open up smoothly.

In the air, the swing to the right following full throttle setting was easily held by applying approximately threequarters of the available rudder deflection.

To recover from a stall (flaps and underarriage in the "up" position) presented no problem. At the stall, the nose dropped straight through 30deg and recovery was complete with the resultant increase in speed.

Recovery from a dive was also trouble-free. It was quick and required only light stick force. JF319 was eventually lost in a flying accident following its development flying at A&AEE, Boscombe Down.

**JF320 and JF321** were both used for propeller testing by RotoI; JF321 being fitted with a contra-rotating propeller.

## Examining the Griffon

At this stage it is convenient to look in greater detail at the development of the Griffon aero-engine, which was originally conceived as a high-power, low-altitude unit to meet the requirement of the British Royal Navy.

Prior to the appearance of the definitive Griffon, there was the "Griffonized" Merlin engine which incorporated a Griffon crankcase but retained the Merlin cylinders, wheelcase, supercharger and reduction gear. This modified engine was first flight-tested in a Fairey Battle (N2234), October 16, 1939, from Hucknall aerodrome, the Rolls-Royce Experimental Flight Test Establishment in Nottinghamshire.

The Griffon proper (Mark IIA)--soon to be replaced by the Griffon IIB--had now been produced and was flight tested in a Hawker Henley (L3414) on March 13, 1941, also from Hucknall.

The principal feature of the Griffon was that the magneto and cambants were driven from the front end of the crankshaft instead of the rear as on the Merlin. Drive for the supercharger and components at the rear of the engine was also taken from the front of the crankshaft; being effected by a long spring drive-shaft carried in bearings in the lower half of the crankcase. Considerable cleaning-up in design was also accomplished by the elimination of all possible external pipework; using instead internal passages in the castings. Thus, maintenance and overhaul requirements were considerably simplified.

The bore and stroke of the engine were 6:0 and 6:6 inches respectively giving a capacity of 36:75 litres. The two-piece construction cylinders were arranged, like the Merlin, in 60deg vee formation with six cylinders per bank. Further particulars applicable to the Mk.IIA and IIB are as follows. Supercharger gear ratios of 8:25 (MS--moderately supercharger) and 11:22 (FS--fully supercharger). Supercharger rotor diameter 9:75 inches. Maximum power output was 1,735 brake horsepower at 16,000 feet.

The first production Griffon IIB was delivered on March 31, 1942, this version being installed in the Royal Navy's Faiey Firefly--a carrierborne, two-seat reconnaissance fighter. Development and production of the single-stage, two-speed marks continued with the RG2SM (Griffon Mk.III and IV for the RAF's Spifire XII) and the RG14SM (Mk.VI for the RN's Seafire XV and XVII).

It was inevitable that the Griffon would follow suit with the Merlin and be equipped with a two-stage supercharger, and, in line with Merlin policy was given a mark number range beginning with the Mark 60. The use of the two-stage supercharger permitted the higher compression ratios necessary to obtain high-altitude flight. However, an intercooler was necessary because the fuel vapour (charge) leaving the supercharger was of such a critically high temperature.

The charge cooling was carried out after the style of the Merlin intercooled series; but differed slightly in that the intercooler--atop of the supercharger between the cylinder bank vee--was set at an angle to the centreline of the engine. This method of mounting eliminated the sharp angle through which the mixture had to turn in passing from the volute to the intercooler. It was reasonable to suppose that in negotiating this sharp angle a loss in boost pressure, though small, would be present. Thus, by mounting it to meet the charge flow, this loss--if not entirely eliminated--would be reduced.

The Griffon intercooled series was only slightly greater in size than the Merlin counterparts. A comparison of overall dimensions shows that the Griffon Mark 65 (at an overall length of 81 inches) was only 3 inches longer than the equivalent Merlin, the Mk.66. Respective overall heights were Griffon 45 inches (Merlin 436 inches) and overall width 29.5 (29.8) inches. Frontal area was 7.9 sq.ft. bare and 11 sq.ft. when installed in the Spitife XIV. Dry weight was 2,090 lb. Amazingly, despite the similarity in size, the Griffon had a swept volume (2,239 cu.in.) which was 35\(\cdot\)9\(\%\) larger than that of the Merlin.

The two-stage Griffons were the same mechanically as the Griffon IIB except that the supercharger drive from the front end was dispensed with and the drive taken from the rear end of the crankshaft through the medium of a spring drive as in the normal Merlin practice. Instead of the usual type of S.U. carburettor, a Bendix-Stromberg fuel injection unit was fitted. The remainder of the engine assembly was similar to the Griffon II.

The first bench run of the two-stage Griffon took place on June 27, 1942; with deliveries beginning on December 12, 1942.

## 6 Test Mk.Xivs

**RB141.** The first "true" Mk.XIV to be tested was actually the second production aircraft (RB141). During the period of November 14-20, 1943, handling trials were carried out with RB141 when the results were compared with those obtained from similar trials with the prototype aircraft JF319. Flown at a take-off weight of 8,490 lb.--and with a 90 Imperial gallon drop-tank for part of the time--no great differences were found in the handling qualities. The revised fin and rudder decreased the change required in directional trim with speed. Fin and rudder area was 7-40 sq.ft.

**RB144.** The fifth production model (RB144) was flown between November 25, 1943, and March 1, 1944, for a total of 150 hours and 121 flights; with very little trouble being experienced from the Griffon 65 installed. Circular exhaust stubs were fitted to this aircraft for the last 45 hours of the trials. Starting the Griffon engine could only be achieved by loading the Coffman starter with 4-bore paper cartridges (purple in colour). Take-off weight was 8,445 lb. except for a few hours when this was increased to 8,845 lb, as a result of fitting the aircraft with a 45 Imp. gal. drop tank. Attempts were made to fit the Mk.XIV with a 30-gal. drop-tank, but were unsuccessful because--without modification--the forward ctt-away fouled the air intake scoop.

Speeds of between 450 and 470 mph (limiting speed),were reached during diving tests when the aircraft was subjected to 61 sustained dives. Oil consumption-was low--an average of 2.8 pints per hour during the tests.

When ground running the engine, it was found necessary to lash the aircraft down firmly, especially at the tail. Manual holding-down was not sufficient as the lift at the tail during maximum run-up was approximately 650 lb.

One unsatisfactory feature became apparent from the initial tests with the 45-gal. drop-tank--it was discovered that the fuel pressure warning light came on shortly _after_ the engine cut. This could be a disconcerting experience, particularly if the aircraft were flying at low altitude at the time. The fuel pressure warning light came on when pressure dropped to 10 lb./sq.in. The release lever was situated on the strapboard side of the cockpit.

Two years later RB144 was fitted with a contratating propeller by the de Havilland company. The powerplant installed was then a Griffon 85.

**RB146.** Gun heating trials were carried out on RB146 and found to be unsatisfactory. The position was improved not so much by additional protection but by the introduction of the "E" ("universal") wing. This resulted in the heat being fed into two bays, whereas on RB146, with the "C" wing armament, there were six bays. This aircraft was frequently flow whilst on gun heating, spinning and fuel consumption trials from Boscombe Down by the outstanding Polish fighter pilot, Jan. Zurakowski, who later became test pilot for Martin-Baker Aircraft Co. Ltd. and Gloster Aircraft Co. Ltd.

**RM766.** This Griffon-Spiffre was used in connection with the later gun heating trials. Other Griffon-Spiffres which were subjected to tests included the following aircraft.

**MV247.** FR.Mk.XIV. Trials during March and April, 1945, which included the fitting of a rear-view "teardrop" cockpit canopy. Prefix "FR" indicated camera installation; "Fighter Reconnaissance".

**RM784.** Spinning, manoeuvrability and handling tests at A&AEE, Boscombe Down, in March, 1945. Frequently flown by Jan. Zurakowski.

**RM929.** Tests to determine efficiency of chlorobromomethane and dry powder carried out by Fire Research Board. Subsequently allocated maintenance serial 6849M.

**NH706.** Tests by Rolls-Royce with Griffon 65, between April 1944 and July 1947.

**RM766.** Tested at A&AEE in May 1945. Nature of tests not known.

**RM650 and RM689.** Used by AFDU--Air Fighting Development Unit--in late 1944 for testing the efficiency of a curved windscreen. Results did not show sufficient improvement of vision to justify introduction of new windshield. RM689 went on to Rolls-Royce in March 1949, for liaison work and later became civil-registered as G-ALGT. In 1968 it participated in the film _Battle of Britain_, for which it had wing tips fitted. After "demobilization", it retained a camouflage finish and subsequently became "RM619" coded "AP-D".

**RM790, NH707 and TP240** were all engaged on the testing of the Mk.IX rocket projectile installation.

**TX980.** Tested by Rolls-Royce with a special three-speed supercharger during period September 1945-October 1948.

**TZ138.** Another surviving example, this FR.Mk.XIV E shipped to Canada for winterization trials in the winter months of 1945-46. New trials were carried out from Fort Nelson, British Columbia, during the period January 15-27, 1947, and finally from Churchill, Manitoba, between February 17-28, 1948, when the tests which had continued for 95 days were concluded. During this period the aircraft was fitted with modified (de Havilland D.H.82C) Tiger Moth skis following several incidents when its wheels broke through the snow surface. However, operations of single-motor fighters on skis were not recommended and the aircraft was then disposed of; being sold to Imperial Oil Company of Edmonton, Alberta. It was issued with a civil licence and became the Canadian-registered CF-GMZ. In this guise, CF-GMZ participated in the National Air Races at Cleveland, Ohio, with racing No. "80"--and took third place in the Tinnerman Trophy Race in 1949. Between 1949 and 1960 the history of TZ138 is obscure but it was apparently at one time defined for Cuba, but following damage en route, its delivery was abandoned.

## 11 SPIFIRE XIVS IN Production

Only the first batch of aircraft produced were fitted with the "C" wing armament. The remaining aircraft were fitted with the "E" ("universal") wing armament. The "E" wing could be identified by the 20-mm. cannon being situated in the outer bay with a faired stub plugging the inner bay.

The first production Mk.XIV aircraft--delivered to No. 39 Maintenance Unit in October, 1943--were RB142 and RB143, the former being the first to enter squadron service.

The Mk.XIV assemblies produced by the Vickers-Armstrongs (Supermarine) factories at Aldermaston, Chattis Hill, Keevil, Southampton and Winchester, appeared in two versions; the F.Mk.XIV--fighter version and the FR.Mk.XIV for fighter-reconnaissance work at low altitude. The FR version carried one F.24 camera in the fuselage behind the cockpit on the port side for oblique photography. Normal armament was retained.

The majority of Mk.XIVs appeared with the standard "balloon"-type cockpit hood. Later the rear-view hood --the 360"-vision "bubble" canopy--was introduced on to the production line.

For low-altitude work, wingtips were removed or "clipped". This was applicable to both versions; although, because of the nature of the role, all FR, variants had "clipped" wings. It was _not_, therefore, a means for establishing the identity of an individual F./FR.Mk.XIV.

External armament of the F.Mk.XIV C consisted of one 500-lb. bomb carried beneath the fuselage; while on the F.Mk.XIV E, this was augmented by one 250-lb. bomb under each wing.

The fuselage and wing bombs were released by operation of a push button situated on the top of the throttle control lever. A manual release handle was available in the event of electrical failure.

Pilots were extremely eager to fly the "new" Spiffre and were enthused by its superior performance. Inevitably, some pilots felt that this was no longer a "Spiffre" with its bigger nose, redesigned fin and rudder and larger (two) underwing radiators. A total of 957 of both variants was produced.

## 11 The Mk.XIV IN Action--Europe

The privilege of receiving the first Griffon-Spiffres in service, went to No. 610 (County of Chester) Squadron, R.A.F., who picked up eight of the new aircraft on arrival at Exeter Airport, South Devon, on January 6, 1944. These aircraft had previously been delivered from Nos. 33 and 39 Maintenance Units.

Within two days, Flight Sergeant White was airborne (in RB154) for just under two hours in company with a Spitife Mk.V, the Squadron's outgoing equipment.

Familiarization with the new Griffon-Spits, by pilots through local flying interspersed with convoy patrols was the pattern throughout February--at the end of which No. 610 had 19 Mk.XIVs on strength; a full quota.

A weakness in the rear fuselage near the tail section became apparent following a test flight to 40,000 feet by RB150 on February 16. An inspection of all Mk.XIVs was ordered; and RB140 was also found to be in similar condition. The aircraft were repaired and suitably strengthened by Air Service Training Ltd. at Exeter.

No. 610 Squadron suffered its first accident with a Mk.XIV when RB156 forced landed at Harrowbeer near Yelverton (Somerset), on February 2, through excessive vibration caused by plug trouble.

Teething troubles were relatively few and seem to have created little difficulty. The Mark XIV was favourably acclaimed, particularly by the pilots who thought it to be a "marvellous plane". Ground crews had some misgivings--because of the inaccessibility of some components when servicing--but these were not of a serious nature.

Tyre changes were frequent due to the combination of the increased weight of the aircraft (up to 8,500 lb.) and higher landing speeds. Tyres had a life covering only eight to 12 landings.

The next R.A.F. Figure Command unit to receive the Mk.XIV was No. 91 Squadron, picking up six aircraft on arrival at Castle Camps, near Haverhill, Suffolk, on February 29, 1944. However, a move north to Scotland was soon made--to Drem, near Edinburgh--by which time, March 8, there were 13 Mk.XIVs on strength.

No. 91 Squadron got off to a bad start with its first operational mission which took place on the 12th. RB172 (Flight Sergeants C. Sayer (RB172) and B. Ritchie (RB188)) were "scrambled" in order to assist an incoming Consolidated B-24 Liberator. No help was in fact required; but, because of deteriorating weather, RB188 crashed at 19:00 hours 20 miles south of Turnhouse with the loss of the pilot. Dusk flying was carried out on March 17, and everyone was pleasantly surprised to find how nice the Mk.XIV was to fly at night. No trouble being experienced from exhaust flames.

On April 10, 1944, No. 322 (Dutch) Squadron took possession of 20 Mk.XIVs on arriving at Acklington and soon found the fuel consumption to be higher than previously experienced. To quote one pilot: "You can see it go down the gauge."

A move to West Malling, near Maidstone (Kent), was made by No. 91 Squadron on April 23--the unit declaring itself to be operational by the following day.

The first No. 91 sortie over enemy territory with Mk.XIVs was permitted on April 28 when RB182 and NH697 were "scrambled" to intercept an aircraft over Rouen--this turned out to be a USAAEF Lockheed P-38 Lightning.

The next day, Flying Officer J. Collis (RB187) was lost when his aircraft failed to return from a patrol over the Thames Estuary.

In its first month of operations, No. 91 Squadron recorded 132 hours 45 minutes (day) and 14 hours 55 minutes (night) of operational flying.

On May 7, No. 322 (Dutch) Squadron, now based at Harford Bridge (later Blackbushe) in Hampshire, received and entertained a royal visitor. During his stay His Royal Highness Prince Bernhard of the Netherlands flew "C-for-Charlie" for 15 minutes.

During May, No. 610 Squadron was engaged in offensive "sweeps" and _Rodeos*_ over Occupied Europe. While four aircraft of this squadron were carrying out a shipping reconnaissance on the 22nd, the Flight Leader, Flight Lieutenant H. Percy (RB162), was hit by anti-aircraft fire off Plemont Point, Guernsey. Climbing to 1,500 ft., Percy baleed-out but, unfortunately, his parachute failed to open.

This squadron lost another aircraft the following day when RB178 crashed on landing returning from a _Ramrod_.* The pilot, Flight Lieutenant West, was fatally injured.

The first Spitife Mk.XIV known to be lost over enemy-held territory, also belonged to No. 610. Piloted by Flying Officer Colgrave (RB175), it was hit by fire from a _flak_ wagon while on a _Rhubarb*_. The aircraft broke up following an attempt by the pilot to make a forced landing eight miles s.s.e. of Lamballe. Later four aircraft were sent out to destroy the wreckage, but these were driven off by a heavy anti-aircraft barrage.

To combat the V.1 Flying Bomb ("divers" as they were also called) menace, No. 91 Squadron began "anti-diver" patrols on April 16 and immediately had one success when Flight Lieutenant H. Moffett (RM617) destroyed one over Kenley (Surrey) after chasing it for 20 miles.

On June 18, No. 91 Squadron flew 53 sorties against the new German revenge weapon. On this day No. 91 Squadron was joined by No. 610 Squadron which had been moved to West Malling (Kent) to undertake similar duties. In fact, this became its sole activity until the end of July, by which time it had destroyed 43 "divers" and moved from West Malling to Westhampnett near Chichester, and to Friston near Eastbourne (Sussex). No. 610 Squadron had opened its score on June 20 when it destroyed four "divers" after 34 sorties.

After running out of ammunition on June 23, Flying Officer K. Collis (NH698) tipped over a "diver", causing it to go out of control. This is believed to have been the first such Mk.XIV "tipping", although it became a not uncommon occurrence in the following weeks. It was not, however, without its dangers.

On June 29, No. 91 flew 63 sorties and destroyed 11 "divers", two falling to Flight Lieutenant Nash (RM615).

At the close of June, No. 91 had flown 1048 hr. 55 min. operationally and had destroyed 63 "divers".

All through the month of July, No. 91 Squadron kept up the hectic pace. The record book shows:

\begin{tabular}{c c c}
**July** & **Sorties** & **Destroyed** \\ \hline
1 & 24 & 6 divers \\ \hline
3 & 20 & 7 divers \\ \hline
4 & 45 & 7 divers \\ \hline
5 & 34 & 6 divers \\ \hline
7 & 46 & 12 divers \\ \hline \end{tabular}

*_Ramrod_ was target elimination by fighter-protected bombers. _Rodeos_ was a fighter “sweep” over enemy-held territory. _Rububanks_ were small-scale fighter ground attacks on targets-of-opportunity.

\begin{tabular}{c c c}
**July** & **Sorties** & **Destroyed** \\ \hline
1 & 24 & 6 divers \\ \hline
3 & 20 & 7 divers \\ \hline
4 & 45 & 7 divers \\ \hline
5 & 34 & 6 divers \\ \hline
7 & 46 & 12 divers \\ \hline \end{tabular}

*_Ramrod_ was target elimination by fighter-protected bombers. _Rodeos_ was a fighter “sweep” over enemy-held territory. _Rubanks_ were small-scale fighter ground attacks on targets-of-opportunity.

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:7]

and so on until the end of the month, by which time 104 divers had been destroyed, bringing the total to 167.

There was a doubt side, too. Flying Officer McKinley of No. 610 Squadron crashed in RB142 on July 12, after flying through the explosion of a "diver" which he had attacked. Flight Lieutenant Seghers of No. 91 Squadron collided with a V.1 near East Hoathley (Sussex) on July 26 and crashed in RM743. On July 31, Flying Officer Schade of No. 91 was killed in RM654 following a collision with a Hawker Tempest. By this time No. 91 Squadron was based at Deansland (Sussex).

In order to improve performance against the V.1, the Spitifire XIVs of No. 610 Squadron were modified, resulting in engine boost being increased from 18 to 21 lb, and the use of 150 grade octane in place of the normal 130 octane.

Further steps taken to improve speed resulted in the removal of the 0-303-inch Browning machine-guns, the cavities being filled with wooden plugs. Rear-view mirrors were also removed and the surface of the aircraft was highly polished.

Another re-equipping with Mr.XIVs began on August 3, when No. 130 Squadron received its first Griffion-Spitifres at Tangmere (W. Sussex). In just over a week it made a move to join the other R.A.F. squadrons at Lynpme (Kent) engaged in "anti-diver" patrols and marked up its first success on the 16th.

These activities were, however, short lived and two days later the Squadron was transferred to offensive "sweeps" and _Ramrods_.

Then on August 9, 1944, No. 91 Squadron handed over its MK.XIVs to No. 402 Squadron; taking in exchange the latter's MK.IX Spitifres.

On the same day, No. 350 Squadron was taking delivery of its first MK.XIV Es at Hawking in Kent. They immediately became involved in "anti-diver" patrols on the following day when 23 sorties were flown. Their first success came on August 15, when Flying Officer Van der Veken (RM655) and Sergeant Boels (RM748) jointly destroyed a "diver" near Ashford, Kent.

After running out of ammunition on August 20, Flight Sergeant Liva tipped his "diver" over causing it to crash; damaging a wing tip of RM701 in the process.

During the V.1 campaign, the Spitifire XIV Wing--as it had become--shot down 300 of the 429 "bombs" claimed by the home defence. No. 91 Squadron claimed 184 "divers" and No. 601 claimed a further 50.

During August, No. 322 Squadron relinquished its MK.XIVs at Hawking for Spitifre Mk.IXs.

Spitifre Mk.XIVs were taken-on-charge by No. 41 Squadron on September 12; parting with Spitifre Mk.XIIs which had been on strength since April 1943. Two days later, the first mission using the new aircraft was carried out by Flying Officer D. E. Tebbit (RM698) and Flight Sergeant R. Stephenson (RM797). They helped to provide escort cover for a raid by USAAF Boeing B-17 Fortress bomgely.

On September 16, Blue Section of No. 41 Squadron (comprising RM699, 710 and 770) attacked a secret weapon site at the Hague; while some 10 miles further n.e. and at the same time, Red Section (with RM789, 790 and 791) carried out an armed reconnaissance in the Katwijk-aan-Zee area.

Squadrons continued to move over to the Continent as the Allied advance continued; and, as part of this strategy, No. 130 Squadron made the trip across the 272

During October, a new phase of operations was launched. This was directed against the Messerschmitt Me 262 two-jet fighter and resulted in "anti-jet" patrols. On the 11th, No. 130 carried out three dozen such sorties. The pilots on returning, although unsuccessful in achieving interception, formed the opinion that given adequate height and a reasonable position from which to attack, the new threat posed by the jet fighter would quickly be nullified.

Worth correcting at this point is an incident previously purported to give credit to a Spitifre XIV of No. 401 Squadron, RCAF, for the destruction of the first Me 262 jet fighter on October 5, 1944. A check of the squadron records shows that this enemy aircraft was in fact interpreted and shot down by five Spitifre IXs of No. 401 Squadron, which were on strength at the time. In fact, its MK.XIVs did not arrive until May 6, 1945.

Armed reconnaissance missions were normally carried out at low level with the result that these aircraft were subjected to even small arms fire. To illustrate this, 12 MK.XIVs of No. 130 Squadron (led by Squadron Leader Tripe, DFC) were engaged in attacks on enemy motor transport on October 24. During this time the squadron leader's Spitifre was struck in the cockpit by a revolver bullet which had been fired by an angry member of the _Wehrmacht_ travelling in a bus then being attacked.

Personal from No. 430 Squadron ferried in their first five Spitifre XIVs from No. 83 Ground Servicing Unit, Tangmere, near Chichester (Sussex), to their base at B.78 Advanced Landing Ground in the Netherlands on November 25. By the following day they were flying their first mission--with RM821: "B" and RM876: "U" --an a tactical reconnaissance mission in the Geldern area.

Two Me 262s were encountered on December 8 by Flight Lieutenant R. E. Anderson (RM769) of No. 41 Squadron and Flight Lieutenant J. G. Refshauge (RM 696) to north of Nijmegen. But no results were obtained.

Two other incidents occurred that same day, both involving No. 130 Squadron aircraft. The first arose when 10 Spitifres were engaged by 12 Messerschmitt Bif 109s and Focke-Wulf FW 190s. Three enemy aircraft destroyed plus two probables were claimed for the loss of one Spitifre (RM749).

The second incident concerned a flight of four aircraft, operating from Brussels, which ran into a snowstorm. Two (RB158 and 189) ran out of fuel and both crashed in fields at Moldeghem.

A loss to No. 41 Squadron occurred on December 18, when RM699 was hit by _flak_ and crashed in flames while on an armed reconnaissance. The pilot, Warrant Officer Appleton, baled-out safely.

Heavy _flak_ was, in fact, taking its toll--particularly on the Spitifires engaged in the low altitude missions. No. 350 Squadron was on the receiving end of a fair proportion of this, although not always originating from enemy lines.

On December 23, for example, RB169 and NH720 were both damaged by American ground batteries; while on the 24th, enemy _flak_ was responsible for the loss of S/Ldr. Collignon's aircraft RM690 after he was forced to bale-out. RB161 was hit at the same time.

Christmas Day brought no respite for No. 350 Squadron, part of which was spent in attacking enemy convoys. RB189 was lost in the morning and RB169 in the afternoon when Flight Sergeant Kicq made a forced landing near base.

The first loss sustained by No. 430 Squadron occurred on December 31 when Flying Officer J. McLeod (RM818: "C") developed a glycol leak while carrying out a joint reconnaissance mission with RM852: "J". The pilot was unsuccessful in his attempts to bale-out and the aircraft crashed after the engine seized-up.

Enemy ground fire scored three successes against No. 130 Squadron on the 14th when their aircraft were operating s.e. of Liege in the Malmedy area. Fortunately, the pilots of RM655, 762 and 875 all returned safely.

Yet another loss to _flak_ occurred on January 16, when RM619 of No. 350 Squadron was lost near Aachen. The pilot baled-out successfully behind enemy lines. This Mx.XIV had previously served with Nos. 91 and 130 Squadrons before being taken-on-charge on October 4, 1944.

Seven aircraft of No. 41 Squadron took off at 08:40 on an armed reconnaissance on January 23, in the Munster area where they encountered a number of long-nosed Focke-Wulf FW 190s. A successful interception resulted and two enemy aircraft were shot down by Squadron Leader Bentham (RM791) and another fell to the guns of Flying Officer Hegarty (RM698). Unfortunately, Flight Lieutenant M. Balasse (in RM765) failed to return.

On the same day, No. 130 Squadron lost RM756 in the Ardenes, after being hit by _flak_.

By the end of January 1945, No. 430 Squadron had built up its strength of Mx.XIVs to 17, during which month it had completed a total of 221 operational flying hours.

Two aircraft were lost by the squadron in February. On the 8th, RM823: "O" crashed after engine failure and, on the 14th RM824: "Z" was damaged after being hit by anti-aircraft fire.

Enemy aircraft were active on February 21, when a patrol from No. 350 Squadron encountered 20 BF 109s. In the ensuing battle Flight Lieutenant Lavigne (RM729) destroyed one as did Pilot Officer Lambred (RM678), who also damaged another. A third was destroyed by Flying Officer Van Wersch in RM648.

No. 414 Squadron, 2nd Tactical Air Force, was based at Petit Brogel in Belgium, when it received its first FR.Mk.XIVs (with "tear-drop" canopies) on April 4, 1945. These Mx.XIVs, ferried out from the UnitedKingdom, were in action within a week from their new base at B108 airfield in Germany. The squadron did not, however, relinquish all its previous equipment--Spiffre Mk.IXs--which it continued to use in conjunction with the Mk.XIVs, until May 5, 1945.

Profit and loss entries were recorded by No. 350 Squadron on April 5, when Flying Officer Muls in RB189:("MN-G") and his number two, a Flight Sergeant, in RB181:("MN-H") took off from Airfield B.78 in the Netherlands on an armed reconnaissance mission, during which they shot down one FW 190.

In a later mission, Flying Officer Cresswell-Turner in RB185:("MN-L") failed to return after being "bounced" by a number of FW 190s.

Spiffre Mk.XIVs of No. 41 Squadron operating from Twente Airfield in Holland, scored a number of successes against enemy aircraft during April 1945. On the 11th, Flight Lieutenant F. Gaze (SM823) shot down a Junkers Ju 52/3m while patrolling the Bremen-Nienburg area. The following day, Gaze (again in SM823) intercepted an Arado Ar 234 _Blitz_ over Bremen and opened fire, hitting the enemy aircraft in the starboard jet. Recovering from a spin, the Ar 234 was then attacked by Flight Lieutenant Rake (MV267). It was further damaged and blew up when attempting to make a forced landing.

On April 14, Squadron Leader J. B. Shepperd (SM826) was engaged on an armed reconnaissance when he engaged a Bf 110 towing a Me 163 (rocket-powered fighter) near Bremen. One burst sent the BF 110 into an uncontrollable dive. The jet fighter which had broken loose, failed to regain control and also dived into the ground. Then on the 15th, an FW 190 was destroyed by Flight Lieutenant Middler (RM824:"Z") of No. 430 Squadron near Velwen.

The following day, pilots of No. 41 Squadron--now operating from Celle in Germany--equountered and destroyed three FW 190 fibers. The "kills" were made by Wing Commander Keefer (MV257), Flying Officer Withers (MV249) and Squadron Leader Shepherd (MV267).

A Junkers Ju 88 was destroyed by Flying Officer Hegarty (SM826) at Lubeck on April 17.

A loss to No. 41 Squadron occurred on the 24th when NM821 was hit by _flak_ while on a tactical reconnaissance from B.154 airfield. The pilot baled-out safely but the Mk.XIV crashed in flames.

Operating from Celle on the same day, Squadron Leader Walmsley of No. 350 Squadron--their new Commanding Officer--shot down an FW 190 in SM825:("MN-H"). Unfortunately, Flight Lieutenant

Two Me 262s were chased to Lubeck on the 25th by No. 41 Squadron, where they made panic landings from opposite ends of the runway. One enemy aircraft was destroyed by Flight Lieutenant Colwell (MV266) and the other was claimed as "damaged".

Lost by No. 430 Squadron on April 27 was RM821 : "B" when the MK.XIV diverd into the ground.

- Re-equipping No. 401 Squadron with MK.XIVs began on May 6, 1945. Unfortunately, the C.O., Squadron Leader W. Klery, DFC and Bar, went missing on the 22nd, while on a training flight.

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:15]

On moving to Fassberg in Germany on May 7, No. 130-Squadron said farewell to its Mk.XIVs with some reluctance, since with them the squadron had destroyed 98 enemy aircraft since December 1944.

Three FR.Mk.XIVs delivered from Chilbolton (Hampshire) to No. 26 Squadron on June 1, were ready for flight operations by the 11th.

Another exchange took place on June 25, when No. 401 Squadron handed its aircraft to another Canadian unit, No. 411 Squadron.

Meanwhile, the FR.Mk.XIVs of No. 414 Squadron continued to be very active and, given favourable weather, carried out at least two dozen sorties on some days.

Following the cessation of hostilities in Europe little of interest is to be found in the squadrons' records.

However, movements of aircraft between fighter units continued. On September 13, No. 41 Squadron handed over its Mk.XIVs to No. 416 Squadron, who flew them for the first time on the 24th of that month.

## 11 Action in the Far East

By December 1944, R.A.F. Maintenance Units holding new aircraft direct from the production line, received instructions to pass some aircraft to Ground Servicing Units preparatory to despatch to the Far East.

The first Mk.XIVs began their long journey by sea eastwards in January from Cardiff, Glasgow, Hull, Leith and Salford to the Indian ports at Karachi and Bombay.

No. 11 Squadron, the first to receive the long-awaited "new fighter", took delivery of three FR.Mk.XIVs at Chetitand near Bangalore, India, on June 20, 1945.

The aircraft were tested in both normal and clipped-wing configuration, when it was found that the clipped-wing version required an additional 100 ft. of runway to get airborne.

Incidents were recorded. For example, MV319 was damaged in a wheels-up landing on July 18; and, six days later, NH801 "pranged" (crashed) on take-off following an undercarriage collapse.

A move to Malaya took place during September. Aircraft from Nos. 11 and 17 Squadrons had embarked on the aircraft-carrier HMS _Trumpet_. Leading two aircraft from No. 17 Squadron, the C.O. of No. 11 Squadron, Wing Commander Smith, took-off without trouble, exploiting a wind over deck of some 20 knots. Both squadrons were to be based at Kuala Lumpur (Malaya)--but spent four months (September 1945 to January 1946) at Seletar before returning to "KL".

About this time No. 132 Squadron, previously based at Madura embarked on HMS _Smiter_ for its journey to Kai Tak (Hong Kong) where it remained until disbandment on April 15, 1946.

Although No. 155 Squadron had been selected for re-equipment with Mk.XIVs, this did not take place through a move of bases. Instead, the Mk.XIVs went to No. 152 Squadron who, like No. 273, were operating in Burma; transferring to Malaya, September 1945.

As part of the reinforcement for the Air Component, British Commonwealth Occupation Force, the Spitifire Mk.XIVs of Nos. 11 and 17 Squadrons, RAF, were taken by, aircraft carrier to Iwakuni, s.e. Honshu, Japan. The first batch of 20 arrived at Iwakuni in September 1946 aboard HMS _Vindex_. Both squadrons remained in Japan until they were disbanded on the same date--February 23, 1948.

(Photo: Soudron Leader F. E. Dymond, RAF)A number of the Mx.XIVs--replaced by the newer Mk.XVIIIs--was transferred to the Royal Indian Air Force; in particular No. 4 Squadron, RIAF.

## Type 394: Spitife Mk.XVIII

Almost identical in appearance to the Mk.XIV, the Spitife Mk.XVIII incorporated a new wing design, as opposed to the "universal" wing fitted to the interim Mk.XIV. Aramament remained of the "E" wing variation.

Like its predecessor, the Mx.XVIII appeared in two versions, Fighter (F) and Fighter Reconnaissance (FR) the latter having provision for two vertical and one oblique F.24 cameras. The vertical camera port distinguished it from the Mk.XIV.

Additional fuel tankage was available in the.rear fuselage although this was reduced to one tank in the FR version because of the camera installation.

Both versions were produced with a 360\({}^{\circ}\)-vision "bubble" canopy and, unlike the Mk.XIV, all aircraft had full span wings.

Initially the Mk.XVIII flew with a Rolls-Royce Griffon 65 engine, but later the Griffon 67 was introduced and offered an additional 300 h.p.

The first aircraft to be delivered to the R.A.F. was SM844 (FR.Mk.XVIII) on May 28, 1945, going first to No. 39 M.U. and eventually reaching No. 28 Squadron in Hong Kong.

The first F.Mk.XVIII (NH872) was delivered on June 8 to the Supermarine aerodrome at High Post (near Boscombe Down) for tests prior to being handed over to A&AEE.

Subsequent deliveries were mixed. The last one to be delivered was TP235 (an F.Mk.XVIII) which went first to No. 6 M.U., then 226 O.C.U. Bentwaters and finally to No. 60 Squadron at Seletar, Singapore Island.

Three Mk.XVIIIs were subjected to tests by the A&AEE at Boscombe Down.

**NH872. Handling tests with a 90 Imperial gallon drop-tank and tests to determine the affmost acceptable centre-of-gravity position.**

**TP297. Camera and gun heating trials and the installation of a F.24 camera with two split vertical and one oblique angles, were carried out.**

**TP423. An installation of two 20 mm. Mk.2 cannon (CGS Mk.40) was tested by TP423.**

Because of its late appearance, the Mk.XVIII did not see widespread service and the majority of them went directly into storage at maintenance units.

A number, however, did serve with Nos. 32 and 208 Squadrons in the Middle East and Nos. 11, 28, 60 and 81 in the Far East.

No. 60 Squadron had the distinction of flying the first and last Mk.XVIII in the Far East. It was based at Tengah, Singapore, when the first aircraft arrived in crates at Seletar on December 24, 1946. As work was being carried out on the runway at Tengah, the aircraft (including TP202:"P", TP204:"N" and TP209:"E") were assembled and flown from Seletar. First flight was on January 17, 1947.

On completion of work at Tengah, on January 31, No. 60 Squadron moved back to there and was joined by No, 28 Squadron. Each Squadron had eight aircraft.

During the Malaya Emergency some of the Spitifres flown by No. 60 Squadron carried coloured bands round the nose, immediately'aft of the spinner. During this
