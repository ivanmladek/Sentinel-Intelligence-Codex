Introduction

The Douglas A-26 **Inorder** was probably one of the most unreadreaders U. S. aircraft during its years of active service. Overshadowed by more glamorous, types of assigned devices which kept out of the public view, the **Inorder** enterprises amassed at record time is the latest of which further U. S. planes were rare over ever all active. One of the few American designs to be developed, evaluated and produced during World Warf, it had the distinction of being only U. S. combat aircraft to receive that war. The Korean conflict, and in Western. During the Korean police on the A-26 **A**-effect of other first attacks against North Korean ground targets, are under the last strict of the war nearly intrude and then part years later. One of the manstays of the French air foccen, the 1950s, it served both in Algaria and modkonian in support of French Union Forces. Later, it was to be brought out of retirement and reappeared in the sites over Indonesia, thus train in support of U. S. operations in that war-to-land.

Closer to home, the **Inorder** served in numerous South American countries and played a key role in both sides in the adopted Bay of Pigs operation in 1961. By the late 1970s, most of the B-26 **s**s**s**t oil active duty have been legated to second-line quotes, and it is just a matter of time until the powerful road of her twin engines is forever silled.

**The initial invador, the XA-26, served as the prototype for the later A-26 series. The major differences between the prototype and production aircraft were the The invader was born as the result of Air Corps specifications calling for a multipurpose attack aircraft capable of doing the bites of the various light and medium borderedness in service. The end result was a craft with the size and speed of the B-26 Marastor, the fingrower and bomb capacity of the B-25 Mitchell, and the manuscript of its little brother, the A-20 Huroso. Since the A-20 was also a Douglas bird, the A-26 has often been referred to as a hopped up, together version of the **Hawce**.

In reality it was far more than that. In meeting the requirements set down, Douglas designer E. H. Herleman designed three prototypes to it various missions. The three were basically the same aircraft, the main difference being in the rose. For an attack mother, a clear pass close was was installed, the version being designated the XA-26. In light of combat experience, it was felt that a version with various amendment combinations was desirable, and has resulted in the XA-26. Although initially there were seven possible types of weapons, this was eventually limited to only two basic ones, one with six, the other with eight 50 classes machine guns. The final version, to fill the right right offer, was an A-26 Auto with radar and a central irregularity occurring four 20 millimeter carbon. Here the Douglas lineage showed, as this gun back was very similar to the one used on the P-70, the right finger version of the A-20.

The first test flight of the new plane took place on July 10, 1942 at Douglas's Long Beach facility in southern California before Hinemann, his staff and Air Corps representatives. Ben Howard, the famous aviation pioneer, put the ship through her spaces.

**proplier spiners and the flat-topped canopy which was later changed to a clamshell type. (McDonnell-Douglas)**One version, the XX-26A, was tested for use as a night fighter with four 20 mm cannon in a ventral tray. (Menard via Davis) Another view of the XX-26A, showing the elongated radar nose. In addition to the ventral guns, four machine guns were carried in a dorsal turret. (McDonnell-Douglas) The maneuverability, speed, and handling qualities of the **twader** were evident to at the oniocourse as Howard put her through the series of demonstrations.

Following this initial flight test, the new ship was put through an intensive flight program to see what additional modifications were necessary. Aside from a few minor designements, however, the material was accepted basically as is. In swimming up the test program, the project chosen. Colmen V. R. Hughes, was still put offense for the A-26, doing its handmade characteristics, basic layout and overall performance.

The **twader** in its final form encompassed some rather unique features for that time. The fuselago, of semi-monocouge per coextation was, for all elements and purposes, square shaped with rounded corners, reinforcement coming from aluminum this. Along its entire length hunnes were incorporated which carried various controls, electric and hydraulic lines.

The wings, of two spur construction, were formed from long unspicked solar caps which had integral end strings. The wings employed a new NASA low drag laminar flow airfoil. Within it, many panels using orthofeeres provided additional strength, along a sizable underway bomb load to be carried. Among the new features included in the **twader** were double studies, electrically operated traps. These needed outward and downward, giving more tilt and drag than the more conventional types. Attached by a linkage system, they were able to be extended further which resulted in sharp start between the wing and halo. A small electrode was included which directed the air flow toward their top side, the result being an increase in drag.

The two Patt & Whitney R-2800 engines gave the plane a maximum speed of 360 MP, nearly 80 MP/H faster than the B-25 and B-26, and the engine installation incorporated some unusual design characteristics. Using sheet metal mounts eliminated the maze of wires and pipes inherent in the older winded tube pipes, thus making regular and maintenance much easier. The engines were interactrophie and fitted to start a complete change would take only about. This, along with easy access to the engine without moved, was an technique stream, under primitive conditions in a war zone, was an analysis in the plane is successfully.

As production operator entering the Douglas plant in Long Beach and Tusa.It was decided to drop development of the night fighter and concentrate on the B and C versions of the **twader**. Experiments were tried with a variety of transit follower arrangements, deliverables these sites standardized on order of 80 Science machine runs. As few information came in front operating, additional modifications were incorporated. The major visible change was the new channel canopy to replace the flat upward flow regime by that on the prototypes. This gave added stability and easier entry to the occupied, a feature especially hexed by the pilots. Besides this, later models have major adaptations for bombs, angular motions. In addition, three internally-mounted wing guns were added to each wing.

The only major problem which was encountered in introducing the **twader** to service was a weak nose gear which often collapsed. Through tests and modifications this problem was solved relatively quickly and eventually 2500 at the A-26s were produced. Unfortunately, because of the time needed to retain crews and ground personnel the plane was slow getting into operations, something which could not be easily speed up.

Action in Europe

To test the **luxeder** in combat, eighteen planes and crews were attached to the 553/6 Squadron of the 366th Bonn Group in the late summer of 1944. The first mission was flow on September one, and in eight missions with this group, no A-26s were lost to enemy each. With Air Force Headquarters was progressed and indicated its willingness to re-equequity its medium and light bomber units with the new aircraft.

The first group to convertfully ways are 416th, an A-200-unit. Starting in October, different solutions stood down for retraining and by mid-November the unit was ready, flying the first group setting with the **luxeder** on November 17. However, because of a lack of A-26s from the group and only solid over A-26s and was forced to retain its glasses, no A-20s and K-1 units sufficient Cs were on hand to fulfill this role. Interestingly, the 416th, on its FA-20s mission, was the only run to reach its objective, all other 30 Air Force units being designed by poor weather conditions.

Following on the heets of the 416th was the 409h, another A-20 group which began training on the **luxeder** in late November. With the original the German attack into the **hardness**, both A-26 equipped groups were assigned numerous missions in support of **Armity**uits. Designed key and master weather conditions, the crews pressed home bombing and starting attacks with deadly accuracy and were instrumental in helping to stop the German advance. Losses were surprisingly light considering the conditions through the A-26s were to start numerous more good examples until the bugs were ironed out. As the offensive wound down, other groups were able to convert to the **luxeder**, by mid-February the 36th, the original that unit, had re-equipped, followed by the 39th test early April. Both the hazard Montevitals.

Although German aerial resistance slackened, flask was still a force to be reckoned with, and numerous times accurate German shooting resulted in many A-26s imping from one engine of with structural damage. On the rare occasion when German ignters intercepted them, the A-26s were able to hold their own, giving as much punishment as they received. For example, on March 9th, during a bombing radio on the Westachorn markating yards, 30 ft 109g attacked a like number of 389t, B.G. **luxeder**s. Three A-26s failed to return, while the group claimed eight kills through official credit was not given for them.

Of interest was the employment of A-26s in an experimental role in night interdiction and reconnaissance. Carried out in addition to the more common daylight stories these missions involved four-al-black **luxeder** used as target markers by the 410th, B.G. in conjunction with A-20s and B-26s. The A-26s, operating in groups of two, would mark the target that ultimately B-26s. One thus was done, they would remain in the area while A-20s hit the target. On the third mission a German night flight attempted to investigate the attack but was driven off by the younger. As far as is known, this was the A-26s only brush with a radar-equipped fighter during the war. Despite good results in the three missions, the 410th was not required to carry out additional attacks at night 1 and 2 night 1 to begin to convert to A-26s.

In addition to their bombing and star missions a small number of **luxeder**s were also used to the 69th Tactical Recon Group. Unusual was the retention of some A-26s with nose armchair, unlike the Group's use of glass, nested A-26s. This might have been able to the unavailability of the A-26C version rather than any desire to have the solid noise.

As the war neared its conclusion, targets became fewer and fewer. The final 9th Air Force bombing mission was carried out on May 3rd by A-26s of the 386th, 391st, 409h, and 416th using SPRONAI. It is possible that was also the lastomeric fission in Europe, although this has't been difficultly confirmed. The final results of A-26 operations in Europe were impressive: 11,567 sortles, 67 losses, 7 confirmed calls and 18,054 tons of boros.

In the early fall of 1944 the 47th Bornb Group of the 12th Air Force began receiving the A-264 ns base in Grosesto, Italy Equipped with A-206, the unit took nearly six months over all its sources, free start, 85th, 66th, 69th and 97th, and converted to the new aircraft. While this process was taking place the group continued by missions, the A-268 and A-206 learning up toget them for key installations and German transportation routes. During this period the 47th was engaged in round the clock stores, particularly against supply routes, and we test effort received the Disfigureued Unit. Citation. As part of this operation the A-268 were employed in experiments to test the feasibility of ground directed bombing. Units of the 22nd Tactical Air Command, employing an SCR-584 radio setup near BeBogano, directed Inwards against German targets in the P. River valley, initial results were successful and were continued until the end of the war in conjunction with the dogight strikes. Because of these operations the A-268 of the group flew in both natural metal and black finishes. When the cessation of hostilines in Europe, the 47th was immediately redeployed stateable and began intensive training for combat agents the Japanese. However, before the nut was ready to transfer to the Pacific, the atomic bomb brought the war to its climax.

**Four invaders from the 416th Bomb Group head for communication and transportation targets in Germany, spring 1945. They belong to the 669th Bomb Squadron.**Into the Pacific

The **Invader's** introduction to the Pacific was anything but suspicious. In July 1944, four 2-26 were tested by the short Born Orbs y 13th Suganot, in the "Gimn Reguers". Particular to their A-20s, the plots disliked the **Invader's** long, broad sense, and the engine placement which they felt restricted its employment at lower levels. With this in mind, General Kenney, the Srih Arfie contract, requested additional A-20s in list of the **Invader's** changes caused both the incorporated to make the ship satisfactory for level work. Because of this would be nearly a year before the A-26 was taken into action in any great numbers in the Pacific.

The only group of the 5th A.F to re-equite with the **Invader** was the 3rd B.G., which started the conversion in the early summer of 1945. Though still filling A-26s, the group employed both types in the air offensive against Fomn, strains at port facilities, air fields, and our two completeness, and whatever local industry the Japanese were using top-reduce war materials. The A-26s has the distinction of flying the final mission against the slanted, hitting a sugar refinery on July 12th. Following this the 3rd moved to Ghana in preparation for the air assault on the home islands. Although a few missense were found, roughly against an aircraft factory in 14mma, the war ended before operations were in full swing.

Meanwhile, other groups in the US. were retraining on the **Invader** for deployment against the Japanese. The 3191B.G., an old 6-26 group from the Mediterranean, began converting to A-26s in March 1945. Guirumbing about changing from their old **Mraader**, the census soon found that the **Invader** was a superior aircraft and much to their living. The conversion process took nearly two months and in May, the group began staging out of Hunter died. Georgia for the long ten to 60mrake. Stopping at California. Hawaii and various fields, the turl are at Ottawa in the beginning of July and few their first mission on July for eight giant marshing yards on Jewish. Throughout the group alternated between thiring targets in China and Japan, Bombing airfields in the former, while stinking harbor and shipping in the latter. Though most of the missions were carried out from medium altitude, the census five some low level strikes, using a combination of rockets and bothers. However it was soon learned at 16th bow rate on one page, despite from the rockets' explosions caused damage as the planes completed their boring runs. Thus, tactics were revised in light of this finding. The excess continued flying missions even after the first **A-born** was dropped, and were in the vicinity of Hagasala when it was hit on August 9th. Finally, on the 12th: the group stood down after twenty missions, with no losses and only a few damaged aircraft.

XA-26 F

Despite the **lwader*** high speed, it was decided to attempt to increase it further by the addition of a jet engine. This project, originated at Wright Field in Ohio, involved taking a standard production A-26 and infalling a General Electric-16 jet engine in the rear struggle.

Basically, the upper deck at the bomb by was stripped of its lower turner and radio gear and fitted to hold the jet engine. A single hatch was insulated which allowed for easy removal of this engine, resulting in a trial change of color time minutes. A 125 galot that fork was insulated above the bomb yoke, necessitating the removal of the upper turner, but the increase in speed was felt to warn the removal of both tursets. An intake was provided over the top turner position while the exhaust tail pile are back through the stelagge and outfit each. Aside from the actual engine installation the only significant change was the subsirability of a pair of lowlader Hannestaran groups to improve take-off and climb characters. With a few controls for the new engine, the modified **lwader***, designated XA-26F was ready for Testing.

With the amount of fuel carried for the jet engine it was estimated that the 1-16 could boost the speed of the bomber to cover 400 MH/Ht period at 25 minutes. After initial flight this a long range test of the intensity of the aircraft was scheduled. On June 20, 1984, the XA-266 jet from Wright Field made two 16. Louis and back at an average speed of 413 MH/Ht with 22000 found, seeing a new work speed was needed. However, because of the new generation of jet bomners being developed it was decided not to pursue this project any further and to remove aircraft were modified. The sole example being kept as a test aircraft until the early 1950s.

## "Introders" in Korea

With the 1st Marine Division's successful assault on Inchon, the tempo of air operations increased dramatically. The B-26s reamed up and down the peninsula, isolating the plugged areas and attacking creating energy troops in the south. Working with flare carrying a B-29s, the 3rd B G.H. et memy targets at night, particularly the r/al and quaded networks, causing tremendous losses in men and malletlet. As the ground forces pushed north across the Parallel, the **invaders** were called to support the advance, again proving ideal because of their range and load carrying ability.

In October, a new group arrived to bolster air effort. The 452nd Bonch Group, a Reserve unit from California, arrange and began carrying out operations almost immediately. One of its units, the 23rd B.S. was, assigned to the 3rd B.S. triping to total strength. Later, in May 1952, what amounted to a paper transfer, the 452nd became the 17th, with the 452nd being returned to the Reserves. However all equipment and personnel remained in Korea until the war's end.

With the advent of Chinese integration the front front lots look a series of "see-saw" Iogas back and forth until it installed along the 38th Parallel. We began the most difficult period of air operations for the B-26 in Korea. night introduction. With the forth table, it was decided to employ the two **broadge** groups in night operations to prevent energy troops and suppress from being built up through the ending bench to go on an all-out offensive.

Throughout the war, the inability to come up with a way to carry out effective night operations was one of the 5th Air Force's main problems. Though the 47th B.G. had done much work with night ponding after World War 11, it was no longer flying B-26s and much of the equipment was in storage. Taipe plots show that flow with the 47th, the 3rd began experimenting with different methods. Lacking radar altimeters, blind bombing radar or SHORAN gas, the cross briefer and chromatigism missions. At first they met with success, especially since the mrcub drivers and train crews did not run off their rights. However, this soon was standard practice and bombing results obtained. With more objects, the mrcub drivers were called to be the targets between them. The 3rd, based at Kwan, took western Korea while the 452nd, at Pusan, had the eastern portion. The mrcub drivers on a 2.8C versions, operations improved because of the bombardment's position, but full termination still was a problem on moments nights. Experiments were tried with searchings mounted under the wings with some success, particularly by Captain John Walmesy of the 3rd B.G. in an attack on a large convex 4. New nights after this, he that a team, and when his ammonia was expected, continued to simulate it further in his migration. Exposed to intense ground free, the continued and was able down. For this scheme was postlumously awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor, However, because of problems with the lights they were subsequently discarded shortly thereafter.

As additional equipment became available, the B-26s were able to operate under radar guidance and undertook blind bombing. Their efficiency increased correspondingly but the night interpolation effort still fell much to be desired. Added to this, a shortage of trained cross and extract made operations even more difficult, but the two groups continued to operate at maximum effort throughout the war. On account they were called upon to provide fake and searchting suppression for the B-29s but normally they continued their work at night along with a reduced daylight assignment. On occasion the **invaders** ran into enemy tighters and took some losses but were able to claim a new piston engine slits and a number of Mug probatles. In June 1951, a B-26 plotted by Captain Dick Heyman of the 3rd B.G. managed to corner a "Bedcheck Charie" Po-2 north of Seoul and dropped him in flames. But for most of their missions.

**the **invaders** ran enemies were the flats, the weather, and the terrain.

In addition to these missions, RB-26s were employed to provide photo reconnaissance and damage assessment for the infelineo officers. The 67th Tacent Recon Who eventually was established to coordinate all recon, so far 67th Tacent Recon HR-26s were also used to help provide data for weather forecasting, these crews ringing far out over the Yellow Sea to give meteorologicals the needed advance information to provide weather briefings prior to missions.

Finally, after a little over three years, the respective sides in the conflict agreed to an article which would bring an art tool to the lobody way. With the true scheduled to take effect at 22.01 hours on day 27. 1953 the last few hours prior to this was an massive air effort against energy at fields and positions north of the Unce time. Fishingly, the last version of the was car carted out by a 8-26 of the 3rd B.G. which had shown the first three coffee three years before. As the three time approached a long B-26 of the 67th T.R.W. had reached south from the final team's economic usage over North Korea. At 22.00 hours the plane crossed the 38th Parallel. The **header's** service in Korea was over.

## Indochina Invaders

The second largest user of the B-26 was the French Air Force. Since the initial fighting against the Viel Miron in 1946, the French had been progressively drawn into an ever blooded and expanding our throughout the hodochina penpiaia. Until the U.S. involvement in Korea, the American government had asked away from providing the French with relatively modern material, instead selling on or obscate planes. Korea changed that Mr. U.S. license fighting community troops, fresh and was provided for the French. Among the internationalized people of the French air Force and the Unitedized was the **invader**. Up to the national of B-26, the French Air Force had died off, as these first turn bombers, except to a few Mosquules who lived in the 1946. With the **invader** they could pose fed a relatively modern border force to create new airline against the French. First used at W-Net in early 1951, the **invader**'s heavy fire power dominated energy forces and was instrumental in defeating General Gaps first major offensive.

Until the end of the war, 120 **hundreds** were sent to the French, including both B and C versions, along with a few B-26s for recommension. To build the needs the French often made the planes in our own papers, we only focus on to get on the event further, for starting, the top turn turn sales located forward at used by the brief along with the wing and nose parts. The French crew knew the **invader** to range, frequency, and handling characteristics and, until the end, his aircraft was one of the best weapons used to provide support the ground forces. Many of the B-26 were cut. US A.F. plans from Korea, recomotional again, then flowing by U.S. creas itano. With the end of hostillines most of the **invaders** were returned to the U.S. through a few were kept on strength for training purposes.

## Appendix A Algeria and beyond

As the French withdrew from Southwest Asia, another insurecient erupted in their North African colony of Algeria. As it intensely, the French Air Force found they again needed a bother force like that used in fadocina. Appeals to the U.S. brought more B-26s in late 1956, and these were soon forming and strains Fuel forces. Used constantly in both day and night operations, the B-26s again provided effective support for the emulated ground forces. Unlike the Vitamin, the retebs did not have many unilateral weapons aside for motion change guns, and losses were relatively tight. Following the end of hositiles in 1962 the remaining B-26s were used as night fighters, high speed transports and field hacks. The last ones were stricken from active service in the mid-1960s.

The Late 1950s

Following Korea,the **Invaed** entered the insight of the career, gradually being put out to pasture. The Air Force had already begun the task of selecting a replacement for the old warn, now over ten years old. Eventually it was decided to replace the B-26 with an American version of the British Canberra (the Marin 0.5-7) to fulfill both the light bother and regular intruder. Unfortunately, because adequate equipment was not functioning until in the Vietnam war, we the B-57 helped under many of the same handedness and did the B-26 in lie in the intruder role.

The first B-57s began replacing the **Invaed** in late 1953, and by the mid-1950s most B-26 units had completed the conversion to the new aircraft. The B-26s were either given second line duties. Forfeid to run the military storage door at Danks-Morman and coocool in case of future needs, or supplied to other countries under military aid patents. For these aircraft through to study in operation, a multitude of assignments wanted further. Many new annotated for use as target bowing changes and to leg together units, and at few were sought in the Navy and designated J-0.1. Others became last W1.P. transports, geographic high intensity for their high ranking passengers control. A few new modified tile electronics warfare test beds. carrying sensitive radar and CBO gear evaluation in its effectiveness. A small number were fitted as **Frebee** drone launched and used in conjunction with gunmery meets and test programs. Last, as sites are World War Inc, large numbers were supplied to the Air Force Reserves and Air National Guard to build up these units. But gradually these jobs were taken over by newer aircraft, and by the early 1950s the B-26 had all but disappeared from service with the Air Force. Most now sat silently in the warm sum in Arizona, awaiting the cutter's torch.

## Foreign Service

France, though the largest foreign user of the **Invader**, was but one of a number of countries to write the A-26-B-28 owns supplied. Initially the R.A.F. acquired two A-26- for testing in 1984, prior to testing a larger number into service, but subsequently this order was changed and fewer these two were returned in 1984. Aside from France, this was the only European country to have any formal association with the **header**.

The greatest number of countries to use the B-26 were the Central and South American nations of the western hemisphere. Brazil, Chile, Columbia, Cuba. Dominican Republic, Guatem, Mexico, Nencayta and Peru all at one time had **Invaed** in service, their respective strengths varying anywhere from 6 to 30 aircraft. Most received their aircraft in the mid-50s, and as late as 1977, a few B-26- were still in service. Some of these aircraft were modified to B-26-k standards during period overheads but were never redesignated as such. Aside from these countries, B-26- were also used in classification operations against Hin and by Cubian retrels in the 1962 Bay of Pigs invasion. This was the only instance where B-26- fought against one another, a number of Cubian **Invaed**s being shot down or destroyed on the ground by the reebted forces during the course of the battle.

In Africa the Congoles Republic (now Zaire) and Bafran forces used B-26s briefly in the late 1960s. A secret attempt was made to smuggle **Invaeders** to Portugal for use in Arogda but this was stopped by the U.S. and subsequently the few **Invaeders** ferried over never became operational.

Some other countries to receive B-26s included Turkey, where they were used mainly for target time, and Saudi Arabia, which acquired nine in 1955. However, it appears these newer became operational because of the lack of qualified crews. In the far East **Invaeders** were used by Indonesia in the early 1960s. But were later replaced by Russian I-26-s. Mention will be made later of service by Vietnam and Laos.

Because of their good performance, large numbers of B-26s were purchased for a multitude of tasks, ranging from hoten

## Southeast Asia

Following the French withdrawal from Indecina in 1954, the U.S. stepped in with advisors and military aid to the fledging South Methanese government. As time progressed, the Communist forces left behind in South Vietnam became increasingly active, and by the early 1960s the Saloon government faced a full-scale superlink war. To counter this threat, more U.S. personnel were dispatched along with additional equipment, including Air Force units to provide air support for the ground troops. Under the aquicises of the "Fam Gate Program" RB-26s were one of the types committed. four aircraft arriving at Bien Hoi in December 1961.

Despite the increased U.S. support; however, the communist forces (Net Coys) competi competitiveness raise late in 1962 (An Air Force was requested to provide B-26s to augment the T-26s flying support missions), a squadron being dispatched in December, one year after the first **luxorders** had been sent into action.

Throughout 1963, the B-26s (in Vietnamese marnings but with U.S. crews) fleew continuously in support of AGM ground winds. Because of their speed, frequency range and identity ability, the B-26s were most effective, often being the only aircraft capable of providing continuous air support because of the distances involved. However, regions above when, in August 1963, the air **travelor** broke off, resulting in the loss of the crew. Because of this, it was decided to put the B-26s under flight restrictions to avoid out having stress, but with the loss of another aircraft under similar conditions in February 1964 at B-26s were grounded.

Although this setback caused the withdrawal of all **luxorders** from Vietnam, the Air Force-Forecast realized how-eigmented it was to handle the support operations in the ever increasing ground war in Southeast Asia, particularly night interaction of the Hoi Chi Min Minniki. Subsequently, it was decided to modify low flying time B-26s into an effective counter-insurgency weapon. The On-Mark Engineering Company of Van Salo, California had been extensively invoked in reconcoming B-26s for custom executive transfers and was selected to modify a B-26 to the YB-26k configuration. As this new version was to be designated. The modifications involved were extensive. The wings were rebuilt and strengthened, while the fuselage was manufactured and had their returns removed. The tail assembly area was enlarged while newFlat and Whitney R-2800-130W engines with reversible properties and feathering controls were installed. Dual controls were provided in the cockpit, along with newer savings and additional test voltage, including wiring tanks. In the YB-26k, eight underlying handptions were installed, along with six swig guns in addition to the eight nose guns. The wing guns were later deleted on service modes. At first, a number of glasss used versions were also modified, but eventually the solid nose became the standardized type. The prototype was first from January 1963 and after extensive tests; including combat evaluation in the Congo, the Air Force ordered the aircraft to production in November of that year. The first operational version was flying in May 1964, and eventually 41 B-26s, including the prototypes, were delivered.

Only two operational units fleew the modec **luxorder**, redesignated A-26A. Statisedo, the 603rd Special Operations Squadron was the training unit for crews on their way to the war zone. Although at first a variety of color schemes had been tried, eventually a three-tone scheme with black underfices was standardized. The 603rd aircraft could be identified by the white tail code "IF". In Southeast Asia, the A-26s were operated by the 60th SOS, flying their first missions in 1966 out of Nianoh Phantom (NR), Thailand. After initial evaluations, it was decided to use the A-26s in the night interpolation role. Operating over Loss, Cambodia and North Vietnam. the **luxorders** in everything from troops to supply concentrations, but specialized in "Unots." On the Hoi Minniki. Under the CABIN **minor**, the **luxorders** dropped through the monomations return to blast North Vietnamese road traffic much as they had done fifteen years earlier over Korea. Carrying over 6000 pounds of naplanir. If E.E. bomgs, or fragment clusters, in addition to 1600 pounds shorter the 50 earlier pairs, the A-26s went out right after night ran an attempt to close down the supply routes to the South. But as in Korea, the only enemy was difficult to fit over enough huge losses were reflected. Along with the other aircraft involved, the A-26s was able to hinder, but never completely stop, the traffic flow. Ironically, the **luxorders** often learned up with the 6-S-7s, their replacement from the 1960s, along with A-1, 128s, and F-4s.

Aside from these missions, the 609th gave a great deal of support to the Lavian forces under General Vang Pao, hitting North Vietnamese troops and tanks on the Plain of Jats. On occasion, they were became involved with Russian-built An- **Coittittens** and there was at least one encounter with a Mig-17. Farms adopted other equally "interesting" missions and perhaps somedst when restrictions are lifted, the full story of the A-26 over that strike-term land will be told.

Eventually attrition and lack of adequate spare parts forced the cessation of flight operations in late 1969 and the 609th stood down. From evidence (i appears some A-26s were left in Thailand and given to the new obtained Ladian Air Force. The remaining aircraft were fewer back to Davis-Monthant but this time there was no peripfer for the old warings. A few were kept on static display, but first were stripped of their useable gear and out up for scrap. All that is fit now is a legacy of outstanding service and the found memories of the crews they so faithfully served.
