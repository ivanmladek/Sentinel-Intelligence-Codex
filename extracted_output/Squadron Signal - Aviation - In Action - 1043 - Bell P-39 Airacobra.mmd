## Introduction

The Bell P-3B Airacobra, and its descendant the P-63 Kingockna, represent perhaps the first application of "weepens system" thinking to aircraft design. The P-3B, or the Bell Wood 3 from which it defenders, was only the second design to emerge from the new Bell Aircraft Corp. Robert J. Woods, Bell's chief designer, and his assistant Harland M. Poyer, was a demonstration of a 37mm Oktonomically common in 1935. Impressed by the power that this weapon represented, the pair decided to design an intersection node when the exact one, the essence of a "weepens system".

The 37mm camera can swim a comfortable weapon but presented equally formidable problems to the designer, being much heavier than the normally-mounted MGs and generating much heavier recoil. Itoves decided that the only practical position for this weapon was on the centerline. Since synchronizing such a weapon to fire through the opposite opposite road to dangerous, Woods decided to mount the rugby chain to fire through the project bar. This decision in turn led to the idea of mounting the engine smashing. The advantages of this position in increased handling walls well when the technical problems had always dismounted designers. Never one to first to make it was, Woods reasoned that automociles and stubs had to yet pass employed guard wires Marks, who offered a, but, having good a relatively constant space in the forward section of the message, Woods found room for aracting nose wheel. The original model 3 design realized for the cock behind the engine, the fuel location from the point of view of weight distribution, but the problem of visibility over the nose eventually forced a change to a more central position.

A modified mock, designated Bell Model 4, was used as the basis for a submission to the USARC on 18 May 1937. The Army Air Corp was impressed with the projected performance of Bell's fighter and ordered a single prototype to be designated the XP-3B, on 7 October 1937.

less in formation as these boys had at that time not been trained as fighter pilots. I had about it to six hours in "Ootbe before leaving I'onverhis. The aircraft we were trying at that time were old. 1 think that they had 1,000 years a piece flying time accumulated in the States. 1 believe that they had been at all Energy Field Unfortunately maintenance in this Group was absolutely terrible. The engines were running rough, records on the engines were inaccurate and very poorly used, and, worst of all, the Storm branch had a very bad trajectory and it's already expect that anything with the 327nm never heard of it. Everything I tried to fire 1-at-time or more to note, sometimes maybe these- the own named. I had an opportunity to fly a 9-B4 before being to Australia that one was not loaded down until armor quite and keyboard tanks and thought it handed feasibility. It was fast, meanwhile, and was fairly well pleased when 190 to Australia and found was going to be a 9-30.

Co. Event reached another incident which though remarkinging did not prove to be tragic. "kill" philosophy, they might leader, say that a new 14th and a formalist, and when we have a Zero Zero as according to a small number of hours, no both peaked off and went after them. Before we got there, there seemed to be a good flight on going to. By the time we got to the Zero Zero as the flag consisted of Zero giving around each other simulating a flight. Both Bill and tried to get out if there and shot at anything that came by, till until they had one end of my beliefs but him and sent him into the driving. It returned to camp the next day, a little shock up but glad to be alive. Of course, I was even more glad to see him.

"As for dolphins with the Long, there just were not any to my knowledge, it yet had good position you could make a guess for the slopes and seeing. If the big had a good position you, you had failed and got the ball out there. It was about as singles as that. The 9-30 had a unified range of one did not try much contact with the exception of one mission which was five from Port Moreway to Wis. We evoked American C-A7s carrying Australian-based House troops.

"I had one-B3 engine illustrating with resulting complete loss of power during a strong heart the field or Port Moreway and had to leave him at least 2200 feet. At least, I can tell you it as an easy plane to get out of an airplane. There is no doubt in any limb that it you struggle a F3-B4 and had a good engine within the Allison in good shape! I could be a very fast. A fraction in Region got permission to stir one and we heard that they could get 400 when when normal the maximum eclipse we were getting as 240,264 to 65,000 feet. The "Goha" did not have a bigger and, as a result, although you could get from 260 to 300 mph on the deck, with even 100 feet at altitude the speed for tell, and the figure that strikes this firmly it that it is 250,000 feet were old about 135 to 440 mph.

The very fast combat mission of the Airchox was thrown by the 8th Pursuit Group's 35th and 36th Soundanon on April 30th, 1942. The official V Fighter Command Victory records a single line to that finished:

### B.39D

The remaining 60 Airocarbas of the original 80 ordered as P-3BGs were completed to a revised design. The changes were primarily the installation of set-sample test lanes and the strengthening and rearrangement of the arm armchair. The 37mm cannon was now supplemented by a pair of 30 cal drawings MGs in each wing, with 1000mg, the covering now housing only a pair of 50 cals. Provision was also made for carrying stores on the centerline, the 75 g total, drop tank or a 500 k, bohm. Under the designation P-390, Bell Model 15, a further contact to 343 was awarded. USAwide serials were 40:2991\(-\)3060 for the original 60, and 41:4727\(-\)175 for the second contact.

Further Ds were produced primarily for L-class to Russia:

* **B-39D1 (Bell Model 14.4)** This was a P-400, retaining the 20mm cannon but having 30 cals in place of the 300s. A small dorsal filter gave the last in a new shape, standard on all water 9-938 and refitted to most similar Serias. Serias were 4:28257\(-\)28406, 4:3262\(-\)3864 and 4:3868.

* **B-39D2 (theodor V-1710-63 and re-introduced the 37mm)**. Otherwise, it was identical to the P-39D1. Serias, 4:1384\(-\)38682.

* 4:39-40** These were earlier Ds modified for ground attack duties, with oil cooler and radiator under two cameras mounted in the rear fuselage. They retrained the V-1710-639 engine. They all six carbon in Italy.

The P-390, along with the P-400, was the first to see combat. Experience soon pointed out a great array was points in the design, beyond the overall problem of poor altitude performance. Among the most serious was the lack of gun hesiters which made the gunsA P-300-1 has virtually every panel and port open for inspection and work. The engine was very easy to work on, but the armament accessing was considered poor. Some D's had the radio mast, but most ofd not. The 50 call cowl guns were given a noticeable air scoog around the breach. (Ball)

P.63 Kingcobra

In spite of the "mixed reviews" that the P.39 received, a derivation, the P.63 Kingcobra was the only one of nine new fighter designs tested by the USAF in 1942-3 to be produced in quantity. The USAF was obviously aware that the bulk of the microscope's problems was due to its pioneroverous and having a superior performance, not to design efficiency. Contrary to appearances, the P.63 was a totally new aircraft. Despite the similarity of arangement with the Asrecibo, an order of two were interchangeable, Perhaps most extraordinary was the fact that, although 3300 Kingcobrees were produced, it never has found in USAF rankings.

Bell was also well aware of the reasons why the Asrecibo hadir yet to overcome this. In February 1947, the company proposed the Model 23 maths the basic P.639 to an updated engine and a laminar flow wing. Three prototypes were ordered in April, to be designated X-96. SEI and the three listed different wings and tail design. The nine root illustrates were enlarged. Originally intended to be powered by the Continental V.4340.1, they restricted to the V.4340.1, they restricted to the V.4340.1, they restricted to the V.4340.1, but they restricted to the V.4340.1 in all other respects. The X-9638 were considered to be inferior to the basic Aircircchio in all other respects. Series at 1950-1950 and 2471-24764.

So promising was the projected performance of the new design that, on 27 June 1947, the better the first flight of the P.39-306, the USAF order order two prototypes of an enlarged fighter powered by the same V.71947, to be designated X-93.

The Kingcobra was larger in all dimensions than the Airciobra. The wings were completely redesigned, of a NASA laminar flow design that reduced drag by a significant factor and increased span by a 1.4. In a laminar flow wing wing, the A.3388.1 configuration is made.

As post war research into the realm of supersonic fight progressed, the swept wing seemed to hold the greatest promise. Since little was known about the behavior of such wings, a number of new fast programs were initiated to gather additional data on the subject. One of these programs called for an investigation into the low speed behavior and the near sub-speed characteristics of the wing. The law says when this area of research is meant to turn they asked Bell to provide a pair of swept wing aircraft which could be used to determine the low speed stability and stalling behavior, and to test Buseman's intentions of the data silujo.

Bell engineers began with a pair of standard P240S Girogoras. As the conversion was progressed predominantly developed with the center of gravity location. It was decided that this could be overcome by using a lighter progenitor. At the time the concurrent was saying 1500.00 for a standard three ideal progenitor but with 9750.00 for a turbine p.39. Therefore, Bell bought a pair of P30-to-20 from the War Warts Australia Commission, obtaining the two procedures for the cost of one and getting a couple of airacones free. The new openings replaced the four biglad ones, after removing the old wing, the new 35 degree rearward system using wire instead complete with stits and flags. These aircraft were the first American airplanes of conventional design to have swept-swings. They carried to amkmann and had the rear censored blackbody out. They were designated the 1,39- and 1,39-2, with 1,39-2 and 1,39-3, respectively.

The first flight was made with Bell test gold A, M. Tear' Johnston at the controls and was relatively rotating. As the test flights continued Christmas H. "Stick" Goodman, also a half test pilot, and Robert A. Campine, an ex-ray fighter-bombner pilot working for NASA lamps. This may of the data gathering flights.

As a result of some of the early flights the L-39- was modified by having the size of the leading data reduced and a long travel field adapted under the flat flueueue. Data showed that the wing was interftell at low speed. This led to the standards of leading edge salts and greater wing areas to improve the low speed handling of swept wing lighters.

The XFL-1 Airbonnia was a neutralized P-3P submitted for US Navy conditions in 1946, competing for the high speed, high altitude lighter specification issued in February 1986.

## XFL-1 Airabonita

In 1980 one of the three new fighter projects initiated by the Navy was a carrier version of the Bell Airacboa which was ordered on November 1983. Designated the XFL-1, a designation previously assigned to an abandoned Loeding design of 1982. The new air-state was to be called the Airobona. Bell was using the prefix "An" on its aircraft, by adding "Borting" they gave a marked flavor. The first flight of the XFL-1 took place on 13 May 1984. The aircraft was painted Navy gray overall receipt for the upper air surface which were finished in chrome yellow. Bureau Number 1568 was assigned. The Airbona was substituted with either yellow different from the standard Airacboa. It featured a larger wing soon with greater control, a shorter breakage and smaller motor. The pilots were ship shipter with the smart air that can undergo had to be higher. It was strengthened, and it finally to stand the stress of carrier loadings. The landing gear was changed to the conventional type since the ship was left at that time that they prefer sea was not studied to carrier operations and an arresting gear and all wind were tilted. The gear was moved closer to the heading edge of the wing when it is indicated at a violation of the wing not radiates. These waves moved to easter points under the rear of the control section of the 3.3. Animal surfaces also placed in the automatic of the nose just forward of the wing to 4.1 auf carrier loadings. The 15.10 high-speed collimation AIV-17106 as the first line applies to be installed in a 13.8m flight driver was 1628. Armunar was to have been the 3.5m flight machine engine from the rear of the 3.5m flight through the newborn.

Official evaluation of the Navy began in July 1984. Since the liquid-cooled engine ran contrary to the current Navy thinking the model was regarded with distractor by many. Longitudinally straightly hanging and the vertical wall features were enlarged after wind tunnel tests. This depicted in the small emergency hatch in the canopy preferring a little-hour canopy. The vibration caused by the first shaft was based because it was left under 1.1 might aircraft, the breaking life of the airplane. The expected service ceiling of 30,000. It was nearly straight. The project was eventually terminated because of these faults and because of the success of the F400 Crasar projects against which the XFL-1 was competing.

The Airobona had a wing span of 5.1 ft and was 28. ft 9.1 ft 1018 in, and stood 11 ft 5. In high. The wave was 232.0 ft. Normal weight was 6861 lb, the maximum gross was 72,120. The entry weight stood at 5,1581 lb. Real carried would vary from 162 to 200.41. Top speed was 338 mph at 11,000.1 and 307 mph at sea level. It consisted at 172 mph and landed at 72 mph. Best climb rate was 2,630 ft, per minute. Maximum range was 1,475 miles while normal range was 986 miles.

It erase in 1969 while being used in an attempt to break the popular-driven speed record. (Bell via Earl Rainer)
