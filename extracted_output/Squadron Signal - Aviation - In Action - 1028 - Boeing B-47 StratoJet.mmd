## Introduction

The B-47 was the backbone of SAC's bomber fleet in the 'fifties, yet only 4,2042 Strategies were built for the "Coid War" period. Compare this with the over 12,700 B-17s built for use during World War Two. Although only a relatively small number of B-47s were built, those were quite capable of doing the job in the early to middle years of the tie at

Design on what was to become the B-47 began in 1943. It was not until 1945, however, that its definitive began to take shape, in competition with the K-K5, K-3K, Sk-4B and Sk-4B, only the last could offer any design advancement that could compare with the Sk-47.

With six jet engines, a 35-degree swept up and a surprisingly small crew of three, the Stratiot was a daring lead toward in aircraft design. The Air Force was pavesed by Boeing & design and two prototypes (46-065 and 46-066) were ordered. 46-065 was rolled out out of its Seattle longer on 12 (14.07, 17.000). The Russell General Electric 3356, it flewn on 17 December 1947. Later the entire B-47 fleet was powered by a series of progressively upward 4J7 engines.

Production of straight wire authorized by the USAF in September 1948. The first aircraft produced were ten B-47As (49-1000) (1949-1000), the first flyin on 25 (June 1956. Considered non-out-ready test vehicles. The As were used for airframe development and crew trainers. The As retained the clear boundary's nose and logn down by the prototypes.

The first true production model was the B-47B. On 26 April 1951, 43-2642 became the first fit to fly. On the Bs, the clear plexiglas have was eliminated, the shape of the vertical fit to was changed, dropable wing tanks were added, at infwelling equipment was installed, a short bomb was replaced the long one, and so-called tail guns were carried as the sole detensive armament. The later Es carried uprated 4J7-GE-23 engines. A total of 398.4-67Bs were built, including ten by Douglas and nine by Lockheed. Serial numbers were: 48-262/2486, 59-001/62, and 551-2045/2356.

SAC's fast flight was received by the 306th EW, at MacDill AFB, Florida, on 23 October 1951. Ultimately, 36.5 SA wasing, one MAC using and a number of misclassions would have B-47S. A tour-jet.

The next Stratified model in line should have been the B-47C. A tour-jet version of the basic B-47's unfortunately perhaps, never materialized. The C was known by several designations, including B-47B, 48-47C, 58-47 (for a short period) B-48. Power for the C was to be supplied by four engines in the 10,700,100-th, lunar water. Vacillaing USAF requirements and engineering problems finally led to the cancellation of the period.

The definitive version of the Stratified was the B-47E. The first E (51-2367) flewn on 30 January 1953. Eventually, most of 4-78 were brought up to E 3 standards, and except for serial numbers, could not be distinguished from the Es. Before modification the first EE kept those windows and internal ATO of the B-47B. Later Es, and in modified aircraft, had a revised nose section with ejection seats. (Suppressing), although the prototypes and B-47As had the seats, the B-47D. The internal ATO system was replaced with an external jetfionsable system. The B-47E was up to 200m weapons. This still was't much armament, but it was all the Stratified was ever to get. The engines were again uprated to 4J7-GE-25 or 25As. They were now capable of 7,200 pounds of wet thrust. (Water alcohol injection was now used for extra takeoffthrust.) But, aircraft weight had also climbed\(-\)from the XP-47s design gross weight of 125,000 pounds (162,500 pounds overloaded) to the B-47Es maximum inflight weight of 221,000 pounds. Serial numbers for the B-47E were: 51-2357/2445, 51-5214/5257, 51-7019/7063, 51-5804/15812, 51-7368/17386, 52-019/52, 52-146/620, 52-146/1417, 52-3343/3373, 53-1819/1972, 53-2028/2040, 53-2090/2170, 53-2362/1247, 53-2407/244, 53-6193/26424. A total of 1, 341, 8-478 areve built with Boee turning out 691 aircraft, Lockheed 386 and Douglas 286.

Stratoplets were modified for a variety of roles, sometimes in considerable numbers. While many of these B-47s were received any kind of designation change, many did. Strategies that did get a new designation included: the K8-47O and C-42, both of which were used for engine development, the TB-47ES, used for training; several director materials\(-\)Dels-27, YB-47E and DB-47E, the exotic GB-47E drones; two types of ECM aircraft (one with two-man capsule and one with a removable bony beam with the CB47E; the YB-47F and KB-47G, used as receiver and tanker, respectively, in probe-and-dropate at refueling tests; the PB-47J, used to service test the MA-2 radar bomb-way system; the EB-47J, used for a movie with a snipprome communications relay stations; MACS WB-47ES; and a large steps of aircraft modified for all types of reconnaissance-the YB-47B, RB-47ES (of which 240 were built), RB-47H, RB-47K, and EB-47E (TTDs).

The Stratoplet soldered on throughout the 'fifties and'sixties. SAC's last staroid', an RB-47H of the 56th SRW, was unsuvered out on 29 December 1987, while the last MAC VB-47E left in late 1969.

## 3.3 Flying the B-47 Stratojet

The Stratojet was not a universally liked aircraft by its crew, especially in the latter stages of its service life. With some source by the B-47, others swure at it. Using one of the early jet engines, the B-47- became somewhat underpowered as more and more weight as added to its airframe. This is yet to say that it couldn't perform its mission because of a lack of engine thrust--it could do the job. But, its performance microphone was reduced and the loss of an engine on takeoff, especially an outboard, could turn out to be very interesting.

In how if 272-2008 with three JRD-9A engines of 14,500 pounds thrust each (43,500 pounds total thrust). The maximum takeoff weight is 172,000 pounds. The "three-hotter" is not a performance leader up at that end of the scale. The B-47E had six 4/47s of 7,200 pounds wet thrust each (43,200 pounds total) and a maximum takeoff weight of 220,000 pounds. Any pilot ten 1/50, a little extra power (especially in the case of the B-47) at high gross weights and temperatures can give one a more comfortable feeling. Unfortunately, the Sitatei never get until little "extra". However, if like three different versions of the B-47 for over 1,000 hours and had only one engine failure and a hydraulic failure during that time. The actual number of B-47s lost in accidents is unavailable, but records tend to indicate that much less than 200 of them were destroyed. For an aircraft that was used heavily for over an 18 year period (1954-1960), a less than four per cent accident rate is not too shallow.

The most critical time to lose an engine is during the takeoff. And the most critical engines for the B-47 were numbers one and six, the outboards. It has been stated that a pilot only had about 1.7 seconds to recognize an outboard engine loss on takeoff before it was too late to do anything about it. A heavyinterfavid, of course, be much more sensitive to an outboard loss than a tight aircraft. I don't know if that 1.7 second figure is really that accurate, I do not know that B-47 accident summarizes are full of reports of an outboard engine loss on taxtedt, followed by a big ball of fire as the aircraft crashed.

The slot B/N slot can EB-47E at Lockbourne on 8 November 1960, following a double engine failure. During the taxtedt both number four and six engines were lost (four partially and six completely). The taxtedt roll was, naturally, much longer than normal and the taxtedt was only able to suggest about 50 feet into the air before it began a rapid roll to the right. The aircraft riled 160 degrees before it hit the ground just of the end of the runway. There were no survivors.

In another accident, the 306th B/N slot is a B-47E on 26 September 1962. This was a rather unusual accident in the way it developed. Prior to taxtedt on a normal training mission the crew had some trouble with an inboard engine. After getting it fixed, the crew began their taxtedt. During the taxtedt roll at fire developed in an inboard engine on the opposite wing from the J47 that had caused the trouble earlier. By now they were committed to taxtedt. The co-to-pilot saw the fire but mistakenly called it out as being in the engine that had originally caused trouble. First error. The aircraft commanded immediately shut down the two hound engines on that sideid Second error. The co-pilot had two caught this mistake and correctly called out the location of the fire. The AC sht these two engines down, also, third error. Three strikes and you're out't The B-47 staggered into the air but there wasn't enough thrust from the two outboard engines to keep the aircraft airborne. The crew ejected. The pilots survived but the navigator was killed. His low altitude zero-second jansard had not been hooked to his parachute.

The AC rate in Fayitation Board and SAC concluded that he was not up to their standards. As the 306th was now being phased out, the AC sat around MacCall will again some sort of assignment. It wasn't long in coming. I saw the AC again a few months later at Lockbourne. Eight Air Force had currently needed a 8-47 pilot for the 376th B/N. His AC had come oup and was getting ready to fly Straducks again when SAC had about it. In their wisdom SAC decided that this AC was not going to fly one of their "advanced" aircraft to show her sent him out of SAC, back to MacCall to fly a lesser aircraft--the F-41 Perhaps it was this incident that red some ways to comment that the chip was one could get out of SAC was to screw up or get carried out feet first.

Atao lstoffs were always tremendously exciting. 1,000-point thrust pockets literally gave the crew a boot. The bottles were fired about ten seconds prior to untake and meet f there was no way of absorbing or shutting down the rockets prior to their burning out. On rare occasions a rocket would break it must end direct its blast into the fuselage. This wasn't too good because of the fuel tank located in the immediate area. Also, until the rail fan fleut tank went ports were relocated, it was possible for the rockets to ignite self vapor, causing an uncontrollable fuselage fire. But, generally, ATC takeoffs were remarkable safe.

Once in the air the B-47 was enjoyable to fly. It could be rolled (up to 30 degrees per second at 280 K/AIS) and looped very easily. In 1967-58 SAC began using the B-47 in the low altitude, at first this called for using the aircraft with the LABs maneuver. Doing an implementation in the Stratottellar tust have been impressive, both from a pilots or onlooker's viewpoint. However, following a series of accidents resulting from structural fatigue, B-47s were restricted from the LABs maneuver. Project MLK BOTLE, in 1985, involved beeping-up the B-47s structure and increased the aircraft's lifespan. The Stratoid then continued in a modified low altitude bombing role.

Air refueling, in any aircraft, is a stirring sight. It takes skill and patience to do it right. The B-47 was good in formation flying which, basically, is what air retueling is all about. Of course, having a boom attached between tanker and receiver makes a big difference. Refueling with a KC-97 or KC-135 differed in that the B-47 was usually faster than the 97 and refueling was often done in a descending flight path and with the 135 B-47 was sometimes power limited and the tanker order had to slow down. Once one got the hang of air refueling it became just another part of flying. But, you could never let your guard down or grow commercial. You't got, something could read out and bite you. You. The B-47 was very much a weight-and-balance aircraft because all the fuel (except for wing tanks) was located in a long stretch of usstage. To move fuel at one end or the other could cause severe CFG problems. In air refueling, care had to be taken that the fuel was going into the right tanks. Even alertness didn't help sometimes during the refueling. In one blazer incident, a student was killed when the tanker's boom was accidentally thrust through the B-47s canopy.

In flight the AC, naturally, was in charge of the aircraft, the navigator bombed and told us where to go, and the co-pilot was a jack-of-all-trades--handing the guns, radios, refueling panel and taking the sextant "shots". To shoot the sextant the co-pilot usually had to untaken his seat and often also his pasatute for, inwards, the navigator would need a star fix that required the most ungraded conditions to shoot.

It wasn't uncommon for a corridor to fall east along those early morning flights while using the sextant. On one of these wee small hours flights the AC and navigator of one crew were started by a loud crash behind them. Upon investigating the found the copbit (who had unstrapped for the celestial words had fallen asleep while using the sextant and toppled the approximative jet from his ear to the aslayslow. He stayed awake the rest of the flight.

In any multi-crow type aircraft it is always good to get along with the rest of the crew and especially so when you arrive through together in the alert-type situation that was started in SAC in 1985. In that one AC that could't get along with but, at least, we didt have the problems a couple of crews had.

A pair of Whitemen AFB instructor plots (IPs) were flying together one day. The IP flying the target was smoking one of the fastest mailing cigars ever imagitable. The IP in the front seat was a non-smoker and he asked his fellow pilot to please put out the cigar. No answer. Three more time he asked and still no reply. As they were above 300,000 feet and relations as special touder than words, the front seat IP pulled the pressurization dump valve. The cigar went out along with the cabin pressure. The rest of the flight was from with a smoke-free cockpit.

In another case of not getting along together, a very small, "Chip on the shoulder" AC was constantly finding fault with whatever his copbit might be doing. His copbit, a huge and extremely strong person, did have one bad habit--one that was, apparently, never noticed by his AC. He very seldom trimmed the aircraft but tended to rely on his own brute strength to hold attitude.

On this particular flight the copilot was flying and had let the aircraft get very nose heavy. Of course, the was holding it level on sheer muscle. The AC (who must not have been paying attentional decided the copilot wasn't flying right and the would show him how it was done. The copilot must have shown what was going to happen. As the AC crabed the control wheel, the copilot jet go. The B-47 ribched outer wildly. The AC most forward, knocking thinself silly on the control wheel; and down they plummetered. Several thousand feet later the copilot plant down of theirArc. A copilot of days later these two pilots patroled ways.

The Straight wall, surprisingly, at a hard aircraft to land. Grafted, the view from the gear seat was not the greatest but good loadings could be made consistently from that seat. The copil g-47s were somewhat squirved to land and a 16-foot approach drive soon added to help stabilize an approach. This crude also helped create drag so that the engines had to be kept "spooled up" in case of a go-around. The 34/3 were very slow to accelerate from idle thrust. The approach chute worked for the put, every now and then, some pilot would pull the wrong handle and deploy the 32-foot brake chute instead. This, usually, caused a dramatic decrease in airspeed and attitude.

In 1951-52 Boeing ran tests of the probe and drogue method of aerial refueling, 50-009 was redesignated 78-47F and 50-040 was redesignated KB-47G. The Boeing developed flying boom system eventually was adopted as the standard and the two aircraft were reconstructed to normal configurations. (Boeing)

The B-47 was built 10 taxi, takeoff and land in the same attitude. Therefore, close airspeed control was the key in takeoff and landing. If the Dash One charts showed a certain landing speed for a certain weight, the pilot had better be close to it at touchdown. The bicycle gear throw many people for variable, but after you got used to it, landings were no harder than in a normally-eared aircraft. Ideally, both gear were to touch simultaneously. In practice this didn't happen that often. Generally, it touchdown was with time ten knots of the computed speed and on both gear or the at great first, there was no problem. If the landing was "hot" and the forward gear fit first, this could get exciting. Landing toward gear fit sometimes resulted in a bounce of softures. This was called"porposing:" if the pilot didn't get backintone the pro-earth attitude or began changing the boureure, the porposing could increase in intensity with the B-47 was uncontrollable. Restail--one big guard a really enjoyed flying the B-47 and the aircraft very seldom let me down, I don't believe it was the "filter" that many people take it out to be safe, from a plot's standpoint, all my findings were superior-smooth:" But I will leave it to a 30/n with navigator for the final wood. We use a member of the crew of a B-47 that ensashed at Des Moines on 20 July 1982. They were low on field and attempted a landing at the local airport. Unfortunately, they landed in a construction area and the B-47 was demolished. The crew survived. When discussing the accident with the investigating team, the navigator took them that he thought it had been a good landing--until his radroscope felt in his lapi
