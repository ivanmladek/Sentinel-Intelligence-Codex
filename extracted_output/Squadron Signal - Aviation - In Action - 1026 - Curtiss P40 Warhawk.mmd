Few aircraft designs have had as odd or complex a background as the P-40 series. In fact one wonders why the air Corps selected to give the H-75P sea legislation other than a dash number in the P-36 series since it was basically a re-engained P-38A. Spin-offs from the P-36 design would result not only in the P-40 but the P-37.7 Apr. 4-2, P-46, XP-33.5P-60, and XP-2 plus the ones given by designations and various dash numbers.

Ignoring the Curtis's Hawk bluplanes, the family tree of the P-40 would seem to have its long roots in the XP-94 Curtis Swift of 1932 unique. Although some experience in the lowering monopoline type was gained when the company produced its kernel **Smike** series of attack planes, the Swift, or XP-31 as it was designated by the Air Corps, a shelf first five-wing pursuit design. By one of those odd duks, the Swift initially was powered by an in-line engine which gave up to a more powerful radial, just the reverse of the P-36 to P-40 design development. The XP-31 was not successful with either angle and the design was so abandoned (if did earn the dubious distinction of being the last U.S. pursuit plane with a fixed landing gear). The Curtis Company's fourtues took a downward turn in the pursuit field when the Boeing P-26A was selected by the Air Corps over the XP-31.

Working for Northrop, a certain Donovan R. Berlin tailed to see eye-to-eye with management and was asked to leave. Having previously been with Douglas and prior to that with McCoke Field, his qualifications were ideal for a design project that Ralph Damon, the head of Curtiss, had in mind. He was 
The XP-40 Prototype, Air Corps serial number A.C. 38-10. Designer Donovan R. Berlin elected to locate the scope for the radiator under the belly, but tear that it might be damaged by debris thrown up by the slipstream on baseoff and landing led to its relocation. Berlin was later proven correct when the North American P-51 flew with the radiator in the same location. [USAAF]hired and made project engineer on design number 75. Berlin was advised that he would be expected to have a model ready to test within seven months and that it would be expected to win an Army Air Corps contract. Armed with the Air Corps performance specifications, he plunged into the project with a will. The project was completed on schedule, the first flight being made in April, 1935. The anticipated competition for an Army contract was postponed several times before DeSeversky finally was declared the winner and awarded the contract. Curtis, however, was given contract for three service test airplanes to be known as the TP4-36. This model was entered in the competition the following year and won in A. order for 20 aircraft followed on June 6, 1937 plus another order from France for 200 mrc.

Despite the fact that the design was a fine, it was becoming more obvious by the day that it would soon be outclustered by foreign designs. Having no desire to fall behind again, work was commenced on a new design that was hoped would be developed into a 300 mph plus pursuit ship. The proposal was to drastically reweathe standard 5-86 batseins, incorporate the Allison chemically-cooled engine, and a turbo supercharger. A projection of the expected performances was enough to cause the Air Corps to order a test airplane under the designation of X-07. When Hawaii dropped 75-us finished it looked more like a racing plane than a mixing aircraft. It looked fast. It proved to be just that in the air as it became the first American pulser to exceed 300 mph. The big Allison V-1710-11 engine which was rated at 1,000 horsepower at 2,000 feet was halved by the XP-345 wheelined the promised 340 mph speed in tests. The cocktail had been moved far tall to overcome a center of gravity problem and to provide space for the turbo-motorized and, radiator, both of which were mounted forward of the pilot's compartment; as a result, the pilots vision was restricted and poor. Further, it was found that the supercharger simply was not far enough along in its own development to be reliable. Despite these obvious short-comings the Air Corps ordered 13 series test aircraft was P3-73. Some modifications were made to improve the XP-37 but the resulting aircraft had an even longer nose. Because of this, together with recurrent supercharger problems, the XP-37 model was dropped.

Don Bright suggested that a P-384 airframe be mated with an Allison V-1710 modified to increase the driver's plans and updated, 1050 horsepower at 1,000 feet. As with tunnel tests were widened that the design could be expected to attain about 350 mph at the rated altitude, a proposal was submitted to the Material Division at Wright Field on March 3, 1938. Impressed by the figures, the Air Corps issued A.C. Contract 10316 to Curtis on July 30, 1938 permitting Curtis to use the tenth production airframe of the P-384 to test the idea under the designation XP-4, and to be delivered in February of 1938. Serial number A.C. 38-10 was assigned to the Test aircraft.

Producing the new airplane was more than just taking an airframe of the production line, bolting the Allison to it, and bending some sheet metal to enclose the nose and engine. Problems with weight and balance had to be worked out and a new center of gravity determined. The liquid cooled engine required many items not needed on a radial engined airplane. These items had to be designed to fit into a rather small nose cross-section, be placed to gain the maximum efficiency and still be easy to reach when it came to maintenance. Coolant tanks, coolant radiators, oil radiator, the assorted plumbing that these new items required as well as air intakes, gun mounts etc. all had to be woven into the design. Finished, it stood on the flight line, its gleaming natural finish shining like a jewel.

Like the XP-37, it looked fast when compared to the more compact and stubylooking 9-36A. What caught the eye was the long pointed nose. As the gaze swept at it took in the coolant radiator which had been placed on the ventral centerline of the fuselage just behind the wings trailing edge, a position that would later be used on the North American P-61, but one that would be changed on the XP-40, The oil color, circular in shape, was located on the underside of the nose cowing and neatly raated into the centerline. An air intake for the carburter was located on the nose just forward of the windshield. Farling gives rise tilted to the landing gear to provide an in flight when the gear was in the retracted position. This practice had been carried over from the P-36A model. Large airings were provided where the wing joined the fuselage. With running mountings were located over the engine and the barrels were protected by more fairings. Small vertical silt exhaust panels were used to provide pressure exhausting to relieve the heat and pressure on the art and of the manifold which terminated in an large fared exit.

The prototype made its maiden flight on October 4, 1938 with Edward Elliott, the assistant chief test pilot, at the controls. The XP-40 seemed to be a success but at five modifications were made including moving the ventral radiator toward to a nose position. A fighter competitions was held in January of 1939 and 25-40 had no trouble beating out the XP-37, XP-38, XP-39, AP-4, and fuzzy 5-Pr. Cuts was awarded Air Corps Contract. No. 1241 on April 26, 1939 for 524 P-40s at a cost of $12,872,898.00.

Continued testing brought out the fact that the XP-40 was not living up to performance expectations. Speed-wise the best fault could be obtained from the plane was about 30dB. Although some modifications had been made in December 1938, the speed was not helped. The modifications included blast tubes for the machine guns which had been mounted. Air for the carburter was now being drawn in through the oversized gun failing. The two ducts merged at a point further back over the engine and fed air to the down-draft extrunctor located on the rear face of the engine. This arrangement moved at the airoco box from the top of the cowing. The coolant radiator had been moved forward and located under the nose in a chin type arrangement. A two pipe exhaust system was fitted which retained the fared rear outlet and increased the engines performance by a small increment. A blister was added to the leading edge of each wing, its purpose was to eliminate any tail buffeting and delay stalling by about four degrees. These modifications improved general performance with the XP-40 still did not meet the Air Corps requirements nor even the Curtiss performance guarantee of 360 mph top speed. With added and tunnel testing at N.A.C.A., Langley Field, Virginia based on another series of modifications indicating that the desired results could be achieved, the Air Corps implemented the contract. The H-75P or XP-40 was returned to the Pulida Plant where an improved Alison, 3-7110-33 (C-15) engine was fitted along with a larger radiator scoops. In December of 1939 after all of the modifications had been made the XP-40 reached a top of 366 mph at the specified 15,000 foot altitude. It was now ready to go into mass production.

P.40 - P.40C

Tomahawks

Curtis redesignated the production model the H-6H and went into production in March of 1940. Flush writing was introduced on the production aircraft to further reduce drag. Ammenti consisted of two 50 caliber machine guns mounted in the nose plugs at a single.30 caliber gun in each wing. The line turned out eleven aircraft in March but three were set aside for service trials as there had been no provision made for any P7-Ots. The first model of the line, A.C. serial number 39-156, was put through a series of tests that established its top speed at 357 at 15,000 feet, a service ceiling of 32,750 feet, a rate of climb of 3,080 feet during the first minute and it took 5.3 minutes to reach 15,000 feet. Cruising speed was about 277 mph and it landed at 80 mph.

Changes made to the aircraft during the production run included a redesigned landing gear in which the ratings were eliminated, two small doors were added and located on either side of the wind recos, closing to seal the start portion of the underlacing while a smooth wheel plate effectively covered the wheel redes during flight. Short curved exhaust stacks replaced the manifold exhaust. The constructor air intake was relocated just behind the propeller splanner and connected to the constructor by a long ducting running at and down. The oil and coolant radiators were redesigned and clustered together with the one oil and two freestators radiating a triangle. The machine main blast tubes were modified and reduced in size. An additional 30 caliber machine guns was mounted in each wing. The fuel system was revised.

After accepting delivery of the first 200 P-Ots, the USACA deferred the remaining 324 to allow Curtis to fill a French contract for 140 desperately needed 14-HSA. Despite this action, these aircraft were not to reach France before that nation collapsed. The almost equally expensive British took over the French contract for the RAF. Arriving in the UK many of this batch still had French instrumentation and lacked armor plating, self-sealing tanks, and

[1]bullet proof windshields. The British mounted four Brownings in the wings and advised Curtis of the changes desired so that later batches arrived with most of the RAF refinements already fitted. The RAF called the plane the Tomahawk I assigning serial number AHT41 to the first one accepted and progressing through and including AHR80 as the remainder arrived. Most of those retained in the UK were used as ten times or in an Army Cooperation role (close support). Many were shipped on to the RAF fighting the Axis in North Air. After three thirds there might present its city quickly. They also proved to be tritiy for the RAF pilots who were used to those point landings with the Splitters. This was definitely not the way to bring in a Tomahawk unless one desired to execute a ground loop. They learned to bring her down with power on, touching the website down while holding the tail high, and then allowing her to settle on her own as the allowed in the roll out.

Some sources state that the "A" designation was never used. Others insit that I considered of a single specimen which was intended as a reconnaissance airplane but simply did not work out. Another source believes that it was to have been the standard production version but that due to the many changes prior to production requested by the Air Corps or made by Curtiss they simply skipped over the P-40A designation for the sake of simplicity. It seems most likely that Curtiss did produce any P-40A models at all and for all practical purposes it can be ignored.

Model A-H-82 featured a number of refinements over the original P-40A and the changes introduced during the P-40 production run were retained, with the addition of such niceites as pilot error, self-sealing tanks and an armored windscreen. We on most of 40-80% anneving bomb Shackles. The rest of all of these changes was a loss of performance because of the added weight. An effort for 10 was placed by the RAF while the USA5007 record 13 to complete the balance of the original order that had been deferred in favor of the French. RAF serials ran from AHR80 through 4999/tenues. Air Corps serials were 41-5200 through 41-5304 plus 41-12397 through 41-13327 both inclusive.

The H-82-13 was almost identical to the H-82-12-2. Yet another new fuel system was installed on additional 134 gallo using the fuel load, increasing the combat radius. Prohibers were made to attach a 52 gallo drop tank below the release under time. The SGR-28 did was replaced by an SGR-24 TN type. The Air Corps created 193 of the P-40C models while the RAF purchased 930. Air Corps serials were 41-3328 through 41-3502 and RAE numbers ran through several blocks, AHR91 to AHR999, AK100 to AASK. From the British batches 100 were supplied to China and another 195 were turned over to the Russian Air Force. This model was the first of the series to engage in extensive combat operations.

The RAF, as was their custom removed the 30 calibers in favor of their own.303 caliber machine runs to simplify supply problems. Later a small number of RAF manufactures were to Turkey. Unduitively the most famous batch was the one that eventually equipped the American Volunteer Group in China. The A.V.G., insured the P-40 a permanent niche in the variation fidter aircraft hall of time as the fanned Flying Tiger's wrote their own unequaulated chapter in the history of aerial warfare. To paraphaseia Sir Winston, "Itewer had so few done so much with so little". The C model was flow by pilots of at least eight different nations during its combat operational life.

## Appendix A Appendix

While there have been aircraft on which a shark mouth was painted as far back as World War 1, the north' attitude is frame in the US as a result of the tame of the AVO (American Volunteer Group). Formed in 1947 under the leadership of Claire Denmark, the AVO became popularly known as the "Flying "Tiers". Flying various marks of the P-40, the AVO wrote a chapter in aerial warfare that has yet to be surpassed. Using the 180 P-40Cs - red-leased to China in nearly 1941, the "Tiers were all experienced American pilots, flying for the Chinese Air Force. In the slightly more than nine months of its eastern the AVO amassed a total of 26 different kills of Japanese aircraft against only four combat losses. In July, 1942, the AVO was absorbed into the USAAF and renamed the 23rd Figure Group, Ireland in China throughout the war, eventually becoming part of the 1st Chinese-American Composite Wing.

However, the World War 1 usage of the sharkmouth did not originate with the AVO. Credit must be given to RAE for 112 Squadron flying in the Western Desert, for first applying the sharkmouth to their Tomanhaks in September 1941. Other units took up the marking and soon it was appearing on RCAE, USAAF, RAF and SAAR aircraft in all theatres. The sharkmouth continues to be used by many air forces up to the present time.

P.40 D - E Kittyhawk I-1A

The Curtiss H-87A was a substitute for their XP-46 which was dropped because the powers that be decided not to shut down the vital production line to introduce an entirely new airplane. The XP-46 had been conceived as a P-40 Tomanhaw replacement, powered by the new Allison V-1710-39 offering more power at altitude. However, the RAF had already placed an order for the Kittyhawk I which was to be powered by the same new Allison engine. The (SNACS Material Division reality) concurred with the substitution of an improved 2-40 in the XP-46 and in September, 1940 ordered the British Kittyhawk I-18 = P-40D.

Curtiss had extensively redesigned the P-40 to improve performance. The test usage was modified to cut down the cross section area by trimming down the weight. To improve vision the coolbit enclosure was given new panels. The noise sums were removed and two.50 calTange owns were installed in each wing with position being made for two 200mmm menti of desired later. The radiator assembly was redesigned, the entire air intake was moved forward to a point just at of the propeller spinar and degener. Since the new engine geating gave a slightly higher line of thrust, the fuselage was shortened by 6 and 4 inches. The upper air intake was also moved forward to almost touch the spinar; all of these changes altering the shape of the nose. Added fuel capacity was incorporated. Fittings for either a 500 gound from or 52 gallop row that were provided on the center line of the beltly. Pilot error added to about 175 pounds on this model. The rounds per gun were now 615 which greatly increased the amount of improvement. The landing gear legs were shortened and the method of retracting the wheels modified.

The Air Corps ordered only 22-40 chips with the RAF ordered even less, buying just 26. Serial numbers of the Air Corps batch ran from 0-359, 40-361 through 40-381 while the RAF assigned against ASKYM through ASKYM inclusive. The Air Corps cancelled 1,519 of this model later. The P-400 made its first test flight on May 2, 1940. The feature that pleased the combat pilots use the new hydraulic gun charges. Previously the guns in the wings had been charged by means of a 4-handle and cables which worked so poorly that many groups charged the guns on the ground before take of and flew with them "hot".

The Curtiss H-87A-3 was almost identical to the H-87A. Six 50 calTange making guns were mounted in the wings with around 280 rounds per gun. A flattened type exhaust was introduced through the run on this model (the easiest recognition point) and the vertical stability was fixed into the fuselage a little better. After 85 were converted into two sectors for training purposes by removing a fuselage tank and installing a second seat but since the third agent is to be a good next for this type project was cancelled. Another experiment carried out on an F was the installation of a second set of shackets to permit a part of 500 gound bombs to be carried in tandem. Ground clearance of the rearward bomb was, at best, marginal. Needless to say this newer became popular with pilots and the idea was dropped. Serials for Air Corps versions ran from AC 40-356, 40-382 through 40-661, 41-3506, at 41-3506, at 41-3507, RAF serials ran from AX 591 through 42.

## Palm Sunday Massacre

The Palm Sunday Massacre was probably the most successful single engagement for P-40s. Involving all three squadrons of the 57th Fighter Group and 314th Squadron of the 324th Group, as well as 92 Sq. RAF, it took place on Palm Sunday evening, April 18, 1943. Immediately before, Sundown, P-40s on anti-transport patrol of Cape Bon, Tunisia sighted and huge formation of German aircraft bound for Sicily. Over 60 u 52s, except by 21 fighters were imputed by 48 P-40Fs covered by 11 Siprittes. Caught at low altitude by the Americans diving out of the sun, what followed can only be described as a slaughter. Before the mehele ended at dark, 59 u 52s and 16 fighters had splashed into the sea or had crash, landed on Tunisian soil. Six P-40s failed to return.

The K model featured a more powerful engine in the Allison V-1710-73("FRI), otherwise it was a direct continuation of the P-40K. The initial production run had the short E model fuselage which due to the additional power had a tendency to swing during take-off. In the K-10-K-10 K-15 changed over to the longer P-40K. The later K marks could be distinguished by the F type above with its separate calorimeter inlet and the lack of radio mast introduced on the F model combined with the long tusselage. The TR had an automatic manifold pressure attitude regulator. The British term for this feature was automatic boost control. The P-40K-5 had rotary value coding added. Some of the aircraft from these batches destined for Alaska and the Aletiaus were winterized. The TR had been intended to be sent to China. The K-10-K-15 also introduce a new strengthened forward canopy. In another of the unaccountable moves so far as designations are concerned, Curtis took a P-40K-10 airframe and gave it the KP-40K designation. It was modified to test by the V-1560-113 Millen Merlin engine and also the radiator in the wing concept.

Air Force sensitive ARC. 42-9730 to 42-10429 and 42-45722 to 42-46321. The RAF took 21 K's as Kityhawk Mark III sterilized from FL10 to FL303.

The P-60K was then to have replaced the P-40 on the production line put problems with the new plane caused the Air Force to increase their order for the P-40K.

It was a tough life for the P-40Ks in the far North. This one was handled a bit rough by a pilot of the 15th Squadron, 343rd Fighter Group.

You could twist a P-40K-1 and partially crush it as Li. Mill Mill Cunningham of the 343rd Squadron did after aborting a take-off at 100 feet. His engine landed on take off and he attempted to land on one of the other runways. The plane carthetheuled but Cunningham like so many other Warfawk pilots walked away. [N. Taylor]

## Parallel Developments

The P-40, always adequate, was also always a step behind its competition and enemies, particularly in altitude performance. Development was continuous in an effort to produce its successor. Yet each, it was designed and tested, proved to possess too small a margin of improvement to merit integration of assembly lines.

The Y-40-8 was an attempt to up-power and clean up the P-400, introducing the more robust Altissou-T17-309. In stretched to give a maximum speed of 410 mph at 15,000 feet, it in fact produced only 355 mph and was dropped for the similarly powered P-400.

The XP-83 was 10 kmue combined. A.A.C.'s laminar-flow at mid-the then under-development continental 1,000 by NY-14303-1 inverted were with the basic P-40 airframe. Two prototypes were ordered but neither flaws as an XP-83. The second was re-engained and redesignated the XP-60, the first sacrificed arm, self-healing tanks and armment to the second and end to its lifeinjously as a static test airframe for the XP-40 series, never flying at all.

The XP-40 series resulted from the fact that deliveries of the Continental engine tended for the XP-83 were doubtful at best. The Army Air Corps therefore requested that the second XP-83 prototype be fitted with the British-built North 29. Eaching even the basic requirements of a combat aircraft, the aircraft, no vehicle by the XP-80, fleve on September 18, 1941. But choice of the Merlin to power other U.S. fighters, such as the P-51, led to a frantic scramble to find a replacement.

Before the process was complete, no less than four other engines were intended for or fitted into the airframe. Allison V1-70-75 at 1,452 hpo (one actual units at the XP-600A), the same engine with different superbarger (one built as the XP-800B), the Chrysier X-222 (denoted to be the P-400 Be completed as such), the Merlin G10-600F), and the P + W-2800 radial installed with a four-loaded airframe (redesigned at XP-600A and finally with six-loaded contra-rotating progns in the half-finished XP-60C (training that designation). By this time, with new wings, modified tail surfaces, revised canopy and a radial engine, the XP-600E bore external resemblance at all to its parent, the P-400.

One V-70-60E was produced in 1944, but showed no promise of improving on planes already on assembly lines. Never but into production, it marked the end of P-40 lineage. The P-40 line, it seems, had come full circle, born a radial-engined pursuit plane as the P-36, it faded as a radial-engined interceptor.

P.40L

Kittyhawk II

In an effort to gain improved performance, the L was lightened in every way possible without a major redesign. All but the first L's had two wing guns. Armor, rotated capacity, and other items reduced or omitted and a weight gauges of about 450 pounds was achieved. For all this, the increase in speed was just 4 mph and many of the changes were later reworded in the field adding probably 200 at the 4500 pound saving back onto the aircraft. A radio instant was installed just at that of the cockpit making the L easy to distinguish from all but the last F's. The L's had the short baseline while the others had the longer version. Otherwise the P.40L was pretty much externally identical to the later long-baseline F. both artists being powered by the Allison-built Merrin. The number of wing guns was a more reliable distinction.

Some was tagged to the model the "Grays Rose" Lee. "A Miss Lee was the torronst strip-lease artist of the day, the name sort of Fit. The RAF added to the confusion by naming in the Kittyhawk Mark II, a designary that already given the P.40F. USAAT Series an Iron A (C2-10430 through 42-1120. On the P.40-Cocent fitting) were added to the wings. The Dash 10 had the same removed from the coolant tank, some warning lights were taken of the panels, the auxiliary test pump was moved at every frequency were added to the belty tank. The Dash 15 had an interior aircraft signal light added and a permanent type of carburoider filter. The Dash 20 was given an SCR-695 radio, an incendiary prande installation, and improved relays.

While some skull insignias were purely personal markings others were used by entire squadrons. The 650h Fighter Squadron of the 75th Fighter Group were known as the "Flying Skills" not only did the widest goal trace the courts of their P.40 but also their lightretacks. Major Fuel Sonchowilp is sporting one on his. [Dr. R.H. Hoffman]

This P.40 -CU of the 86th Fighter Squadron, 75th Fighter Group in North Africa, "Punchy II" was found by Flight Officer Vincent Walls. [W. West]P-40L-S-C0 A/S/N 42-10684 Aircraft No. 44 belonged to the Commanding Officer, Li, Col. Gordon H. Austin, of the 325th Fighter Group, The Checkertail Clan.

[Above Left] Number 40 "Tristie" was the P-40 flow by Capt. Joe Shoomer of the 316th and the interesting item on his aircraft is the help tank which the pilots and ground crew made into a bomb of sorts by adding a In and a fuse made from a hand openedade and detuator. The idea was to drop the tank when it was low on fuel on some target of opportunity and hopefully set fire to it. It did meet with some success but was abandoned for safety reasons. The nose insight is "Trige" leading a Green dragon on a chain. The Green dragon was the 316th Squadron's insign and name.

Unnumbered 325th Fighter Group P-40 which crash landed at Master, Tunisia following a mid-air collision on the slot of July 1943. The group was starting a fader installation at Pats, Sardia when the two P-dos collided. The pilot of the other P-40, Lt. Bryant was killed when his tallises plane drove into the ground. [John C.A. Watkins]P-40M-1 of the 44th Figure Squadron on Muanda Field, New Georgia, Solomon Islands in August of 1943. The 16th Figure Group arrived just as soon as the area was secure and went into action promptly. Note Pacific style national insignia without Yellow surround and the White stripe under the wing. (USAF) The RAF designated these as Kittyhawllis like the P-40M- from which it was derived. Serials ran from F1-F85 to F1-F1-105, F1-11 to F1-44, F1-20 to F1-363, F1-383 to F1-392, F1-41 to F1-521, F1-779 to F1-822 and F5-100 to F2-821 at numbers including. All but the six hundred built were sent to the RAF but, according to one source, for some reason the USAF assigned serials A/C 43-5403 to 43-6002 to the series.

## Appendix P.40 N Kittyhawk IV

Curtiss assigned model number H-8FW to the N series. This was the last major production model of the series. It was the fastest Warnawk at 378 mph. In what amounted to a last effort, Curtiss made a number of modifications all designed to improve the breed. Every effort was made to lighten the plane. The front wing tank was removed. Two main points were eliminated. Earlier website were substituted and aluminium oil coolers and radiators replaced the old heavy brass ones. Head arm was introduced. A V-ITM-81 engine with automatic boost control provided the power. To improve pilot rear vision a modification was made to the canopy giving it a frameless sliding hood and the rear deck was cut deeper while the fat portion of the canopy was swaved toff. This was the primary external distinction the Mark on all except the earliest Ns. About half way through the run, the forward canopy was simplified by the removal of some bracing struts.

The Dash 5 model received a new SCR-986 radio, a new pilot's seat, and recognition lights. The external bomb codes and dog rate fittings were put back on this model. The Dash 10 test box of the wing thus studied a new rate of climb and manual oil dilution system and other ode weather operation items. The Dash 15 regulate the two machine guns and the larger wing tank. The Dash 20 was given fitting to carry three 500 bound bombs. The Dash 25 was fitted with non-metal set sealing gas tanks and some other minor changes were made. The Dash 30 had a few minor equipment changes internally. The Dash 38 had some minor instrument changes made to it and was given a new radio and ADP system. The Dash 40 was the last of the Ns. It was fitted with automatic boost and propeller control, a new oxygen system, flame suppressing exhaust stacks and the arm was relocated. The Ns the most numerous of the series and the best 41 around aircraft. A total of 5.219 were built, and the last S. N. 44-47964 rolled out on November 30, 1944. There was no P-40P as the designation was reassigned to a block of the N series.

P-40N-10-CU of the 18th Fighter Squadron, 343rd Fighter Group in the Aactians, spiral on spinner and wheels were blue and orange. Petyl off was a blonde in a pile blue with which I focus where appropriate. This was a winterized version with a manual of dilution system and only two owns per wing. (Henry Leslie)

(Above Right) It is very doubtful that the Walt Disney Studio would have given official approval to the insigial approach on this P-40 of the 18th S Squadron based in the Aleutians. The Blue Foxes expressed their personal feeling for the enemy in this insignia.

The other extreme of climate. A trap over the cockpit area keeps it from becoming too hot for comfort. A home made work bench for the armover provided a better than average work area. This P-40N of the 18th Groay's 46th S Squadron on Hannus Island is being readled for a mission by its amorces. [USAF]
P-40M-15-CU of the 7th Fighter Squadron, 49th Fighter Squadron at Bisk in September 1944. The 49th produced possibly the greatest variety of markings worn by the P-40, sharing only a white tail and using leading edge in common. And these were frequently altered by personal variations. [James P. Galligher]

Lt. Miller flew this P-40 with a diamond checkered rudder, number 16 of the 7th Squadron. A Zero chased him 50 miles before forcing him to crash land. [Bob Koptzke]The unnumbered P-40 with the cheekered rudder was the aircraft of Capt. Richard Yodra, an acow with the 46th fighter Group, with Sguadrona. Dick is the middle man in the photo. His aircraft number was 57 and later bore the number and the nickname of Squirrel gait. Another 4gor, It. Damy Moore, also fleew a similar marked P-40 with checker rudder. It was a personal joke between himself and Joe Littittrich. Both were from Louisiana and as Joe got shot up pretty roughly by "Weak Willier" or "Sak" of Weak" a colorful zero pilot who fleew a zero that was completely checked overall, Danny painted his rudder as a challenge to the Checkerred Zero to come up and fight so he could defend the honor of Louisiana.

(Above Right) Capt. Dick Vodra, wears the over water dress favored by the fashion-conscious pilots of the SWPA. The Mae West was a must. Modelers note the ragged lines of the rudder checks and take heart. [R. Vodra]A rarity, a natural metal P-40. This particular bird is a P-400N-25 of the 7th Squadron, 4th Fighter Group photographed at Middlebury Island after a sweep over Sforong and other western points of Dutch New Guinea. At the time the 7th was at Bink Island getting ready to convert to the P-38. Note remnant aircraft serial number under the tail plane, mostly covered by the national insignia and the 49th's distinctive white tail.

If the Flying Tiers were the best of the P-40 Groups of the entire war, No. 75 Squadron of the RAAF has to be ranked as one of the best individual squadars. While the AVQ was made up of crack pilots with plenty of experience, 75 was has highly thrown together with untrained and inexperienced pilots and thrust into the breeds in New Guinea against superior Japanese pilots and planes. Despite being almost violet out, they held their ground and wrote a special chapter in aerial history. Later in the War, 10 July 1945 their 9-40ns on Tarakan Island looked really sharp, a far cry from the rag tag days early in the war. (Eric Nicotile)

Standing a Kittyhawk on its nose took a minimum of effort, but getting it down called for a maximum effort as these members of No. 75 Squadron of the RAAF demonstrate. The strip at Tarakan was turned into a muddle by rains in June 1945 and thus this was just one of a number of accidents. [Dave Weather]

Squadron Leader John Waddy standing by his P-40N-20 or Kittyhavk Mark IV. Coded Q-Bul neural number A29-907. The plane had the Black swimmer and White tail of No. 80 Squadron RAAF. Waddy had 15 19-40 kills. He few several different p-40s with this squadron and each of them had serial numbers that totalized up to 13, 10 fine ignores the A-29 profile, \(6+7=13\). The "We" under the canopy refers to Waddy's part in the victory in Europe. He first achieved team flying with 112 Sci. RAF in the Western Desert. [Eric Nicole]

It also illustrates the primative equipment that the ground crews had to rely on to get the job done, one mechanic is standing on an oil form to reach the area he is working on. The Australian make-up of the Squadron couldn't possibly be mistaken after viewing the personal marking on the cowling. [G.H. Brian via Mike Garttell]

[Abore Right] The RAAF pilots of the 450 Squadron in Italy were a dashing lot and favored the short sleeve shut along with shorts. The casual look was the in thing among these Kittyhavk Ni chaps. A kangaroo kicking a dashboard is the cowling insignia.

A minimum effort could be expended when the proper equipment was at hand, getting the aircraft off the ground after it had flipped over was no problem but getting it right side up was a different story. This Army Sathee Unit vehicle has taken a Kittyhavk IV of No. 450 Squadron in charge somewhere in Italy in 1944. A man on each wing tip for balance and a couple with a set of the portable wheels at the tail and away we go! The AOK code wasn't an apt one. [M. Garbett]Number 420 Squadron (Istarc No. 120 Sqdn. Milliaire Luchtraanf) of the Royal Netherlands East Indios Army operated with the RAAF. Dutch serial numbers beginning with C3 were assigned to tightness. The C3-C26 was in light blue. Inagium was carried in the usual six positions. It was in the form of the Dutch flag. Later the Dutch flew P-04bis in bare metal finish with the Dutch tricolor would win small orange center. The NREIK was the last out to try the P-40 in actual combat, using them against the Rebels in 1948 in the NEI. [G.H. Kamphuis via G.J. Zwanenburg]
