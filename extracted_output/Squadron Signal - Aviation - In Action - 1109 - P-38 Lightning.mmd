## Introduction

_Dr Gabelschchwaan Tusful_ (The Fork-tailed Devil) was the most recognizable fighter aircraft of the Second World War. With its twin engines housed in long streamlined micelles and booms, twin tails and center leakage pool housing the pilot, few could mistake the Lockheed P-38 Lightning for any other aircraft. When it was introduced during 1939, the Lockheed design immediately made every other fighter aircraft obsolete. The P-38 was the first fighter to feature a tricycled landing gear, first with an all-metal flush hvstedt Basin, first to have power-boosted controls, and the first turbo-superbared fighter aircraft to enter squadron service. At the time it was the fastest and longest raggler in the world. With all these frists, one would think that the P-38 should have been the premier fighter of the Second World War. In the Pacific Theater of Operations it was, in that no host of technical problems remain from its high performance, combined with logalistic politets within the U.S. Army Air Force, severely inhibited the Lightning from attaining its full potential.

The P-38 Lightning was a product of the Lockheed Aircraft Corporation. Alan Loughed (later changed to Lockheed) founded his aircraft company during 1916 and atified during 1921. During 1926 he acquired a partner and restarted the company. His partner was another aviation engine, John K. Jacka' Northrop. Together they created the Lockheed Wheag, Altair and Orion. But the flaring U.S. broke monkey the company once more during 1931 and they closed the doors during early 1932. On 6 June 1932, the Lockheed Aircraft Company was purchased by Robert Gross, Carl Squire, and Lloyd of Storm for 540,000. The new company's first commercial venture was the Model 10, or Lockheed Electra. It immediately set industry standards as the first all-metal, twin engine airliner.

Originally the Electra was to have a single vertical tail. But tests performed by a young graduate student at the University of Michigan wind tunnel revealed some probable stability problems. The brash was young man who informed the Lockheed team of the potential problems was a budding aviation engineer named Clarence L. "Kelly" Johnson. When he informed Hall Hibbard, Lockheed's Chief Engineering, that his design had some flaws, Hibbard reported, "Why don't you see if you can do any better" Johnson immediately let by Michigan and fleve to California to join the Lockheed team. His first task was to run the Electra's problems by adding twin fans and, a characteristic that would be found on almost all future Kelly Johnson people aircraft designs. Success followed with the Electra Junior and the Super Electra, which evolved into the Hudson bomber design. By 1938, Kelly Johnson was the Chief Engineer at Lockheed.

During late 1935, the Army issued a Circular Proposal to several companies for a new fighter aircraft. All the fighting of the area were very restricted in arrangant, with a maximum of 500 pounds of usable payload. This meant that normal armament consisted of one 3.0c/s caliber and one.50caliber machine gun, plus ammunition. In order to get a more heavily armed aircraft into service, the Army Procumet Board established a new aircraft type - the interceptor.

An entirely new set of standards were written for the interceptor. Specification X-608 called for the aircraft to have a top speed in excess of 360 mph at 20,000 feet, the ability to give at full throttle for over an hour, the ability to take off and land over a 50 foot obstacle within 2,200 feet, to be equipped with the most powerful turbo-superbared engines available and to carry twice the armament of a standard fighter aircraft.

Kelly Johnson realized that the new interceptor class would have to be a twin-engined design to meet the new requirements. Johnson came up with six different design sketches, all twin-engined. Several were remarkably similar to later designs from other companies, such as the deHaviland Mosquito and North American P-82 Twin Mustang. On 13 April 1937, Johnson submitted to the Army the Lockheed proposal for the Model 22 Pursuit Plane.

Johnson had opted for a design with the engines carried in long, tightly coupled macelines which tapered back to twin bombs ending in twin radders. The fuselage was a center pod containing the pilot and armament. Power would come from the new Allison V-170, liquid-cooled, 16 cylinder engine equipped with a turbo-superbared mounted in the bow behind the engine. The tail configuration was the Kelly Johnson trademark of twin vertical tailised by a large horizontal stabilizer. One new feature was the use of a built-joined, flush-rived, all metal skin, including the control surfaces. The design also called for the use of a tricycle landing gear. Finally, the armament was very heavy for a fighter of the time: four.50 caliber machine guns and one 25MM on the Lockheed's Model 22 was slightly changed during September 1937, with the design now calling for opposite-rotation engines, i.e. the propheroids would turn in opposite directions. The prototype would be fitted with 1,150 MB Silicon V-170-C7 and -C9 engines driving three blade Curtis Electric propellers. The propellers each rotated toward the center fuselage pool.

There was no 2500 carbon available, so Lockheed opted for the Madsen 23MM canon with fifty rounds of ammunition. The Model 22 was projected to have a top speed of 417 mph and 20,000 feet. Cruise range was estimated at 1,386 miles and in time to build up 4,5 minutes to 20,000 feet. Based on this proposal, Lockheed was awarded contract AC 9974 which authorized one prototype under the designation X-9-38.

Over a year later, in December 1938, the hand-built X-9-38 was completed at Lockheed's Burchian assembly plant. The official rollout and dift tests would not take place until the XP-98 was delivered to March Field. The XP-38 was disseminated, then trucked to March Field under strict security, where it was reassembled. Rollout took place during early January of 1939. The XP-38 was a beautiful aircraft with its seek engine nacelles,

## Lightning I (Lockheed Model P-322)

The Lockheed P-322 Lightning I was built to British specifications and was based more on the XP-38 than either the **Y**-38 or **P**-38-LO. The P-322 was powered by the same C series Allison engines as the XP-38. These different, however, in that the propellers both rotated in the same direction, toward the right.

In addition, the **I**-710-C15 engines used the P-322 were unsupercharged, with a temperature of 1.009 h and it 1400 feet. There were no measurements for the deletion of the turbo-superchargers from the British specification. First was availability of the units. An American needs for the General Electric turbo-superchargers was such, that all requests by other nations had a much lower priority making it difficult to obtain this vital equipment. It took everything that General Electric had just to keep up with the demands of the B-17, B-24, P-43, and P-38 production runs. The second reason for deletion was maintenance. The turbo-supercharger was a complex piece of equipment and the British simply did not have the time or resources to train people to properly maintain the units.

Estermally the P-322 Lightning differs from the P-38 in the shape of the forward engine incelle. With the installation of C series Allison engines, the propeller thrust has lowered (as on the XP-38). The P-322 had all cooler loops in the incelle fronts under the propellers (similar to the VP-38); however, the openings were slightly more advanced, more circular in opening and further back on the incelle than the **T**-38/P-38-LO. The engine exhaust, instead of being routed back to the turbo-supercharger, existed through two exhaust stacks on the upper side of the incelle over the wing. The aircraft also had the larger radiator housing used on the P-38LO.

The center fuselage was identical to the P-38 except that it was outfitted with an RAF style control which, British radio equipment and other inserts of British specified/supplied equipment. The RAF specified an armout from two.30 caliber machine spans and two.50 caliber machine spans, deleting the common amament of the P-388.

The P-322 also had the redirection linking arm on the nose wheel that retracted from the front of the start to the rear of the start. This, in turn, allowed the nose gear well well to be shortened and made more room available in the nose for a minmunition. This feature was not incorporated on U.S. P-388 until the P-38E.

Finally, it was on the P-322 that the problem of tail buffet was finally solved. After extensive tests, Kelly Johnson fit that was disturbed airflow over the wing center section that caused the elevator flutter. He designed a set of wing rotost for the future of the wing rotor and instalge. The airflow was smoothed out and most of the elevator flutter problems were cured. The problem of compressibility, however, still remained.

Contracts with the British and French governments were done at 6967 Lockheed Model 232 figures. It was the British that named the aircraft the Lightning during March of 1940. Both the British and French viewed the Lightning as a ground chack aircraft rather than a high altitude interceptor. The Model 322 with its unsupercharged engines of 400 mgd at 17,000 feet - much faster than the North American N/A's Musta.

With the fall of France during early 1940, the RAF opted to pick up the remainder of the Model 32 contract. The first three 7-322 were created and shipped to England during 1942 for extensive tests at RAF Roschung Down, the RAF's resting facility. RAF serial numbers reserved for the Lightning I were AF 978-999 at AF 100,220.

In any event, the RAF decided that the Lightning did not meet their needs at the time and rejected the aircraft. It would have anant disaster for Lockheed to lose such a larger contract; however, the U.S. Army Air force took over the P-322 that remained on the contract for use a P-38 trainers and for use in the defense of the Continental United States. Although the first twenty-three P-322 were competed with the series Allison engines, the remaining 120 aircraft were built with Allison P-170-E engines with opposite rotation lengths, these aircraft were designated as Lightning MK IIs and later redesignated as P-38F-13, F-15, and G-15. A total of 524 Model 322s were built.

**AF196 was a Lightning I used as a trainer in California during late 1943. P-322 Lightning Is were never assigned AAF details and retained their RAF camoufage and serials throughout their service service. By its 1943, a4-B-322s were relegated to the trainer revs. (Fred Dickey via Ernie McDowell)**

**AP-322 Lightning M.R.I equipped with one 300 gallon drop tank and a 2,000 pound torpedo. The Lightning I was equipped with standard supercharged Allison F-series engines and were designated as P-3267-13, F-15, and G-15 by the USAAF and were assigned AAF serials. (Loched)**

The first Lightning I, AF221 (serial 43-2035), reveals the great load-carrying capability of the P-38 using. The aircraft is configured with a pair of 2,000 pound Navy torpedo under each wing. For the test flights the torpedos were secured in place with steel cables. (Loched)**P-38D (Model 122)

The P-38D was the first production variant of the Lightning to be considered "combat capable," as specified by the War Department. It was this set of combat capability specifications that led the variant to be designated the P-38D, skipping the designations P-38A through P-38C. The specifications called for upgraded armor plate in the cockipt, armor glass behind the windscreen, self-sailing fuel tanks and a low pressure oxygen system. The installation of self-sailing fuel tanks decreases the internal tankage of the P-38D to 340 gallos.

Late production of P-38Ds also had the wing glilles that were first installed on the British P-322. These wing glilles cured the tail further problem that had plagued all the previous 38-N variations. Lockheed built a total of thirty-six P-38Ds, with the first aircraft being accepted by the Army during July of 1941.

Two units are known to have received operational P-38Ds -- the 1st Purvault Group at Selfride Field, Michigan, and the 14th Pursuit Group at Hamilton Field, California. On 20 June 1941, the Army Air Corps became the Army Air Force and with the chisage all former Pursuit Groups and Squadous became Fighter Groups and Squadous. It was the aircraft of the 1st P-38D that participated in the 1941 war games in the Confirulans and Louisiana. Both White and Red crosses were painted on the Lightning depending on which "side" were on at the time.

The 54th Fisher Squadron was equipped with a mixed bag of P-38Ds and Es when they deployed to Alaska during June of 1942 following the Japanese invasion of Atn and Kiska. The P-38 was the only USAR fighter capable of reaching the Japanese bases from the US, as at Oak.

The first victory for P-38-B pilot over the Luftawfare came on 14 August 1942 when LT Elza Shaham scored a number of his on a German FW-200 bomber which exploded. At the time of his victory, LT Shaham was flying a P-38D of the 27th Fisher Squadron stationed in Iceland.

**This P-38D of the 1st P-O was assigned to the White Force, based at Goodfellow Field, Texas, for the Louisiana Manowers held during the Fall of 1941. The P-38D was the first "combat capable" version of the P-38. Thus aircraft has pointed propeller spinners, which were not normally found on P-38Ds. (WL, Banosister)**

## Appendix P-38E (Model 222)

The P-38E was the first true combat variant of the Lightning through several P-38Ds was combat in the Akasian campaign and over the North Atlantic. It was on the P-38E that the Hispano-Suiza 2008T cannon, license-built by Bendix as the M-1, was first introduced. Additionally, the P-38E was the first U.S. variant to have the nose wheel retri-radio linkage than had been introduced on the Model P-32E. The change allowed the ammunation supply for each of the four 50 caliber machine guns to be increased from 200 pounds per gun to 500 pounds per gun.

The P-38E also differed from earlier P-38E in that the upper engine incolet air scooo was deleted. Toward the end of P-38E production run, the three table Hamlington Standard hollow steel properties were replaced with Curtis Electric Dural solid blade propellers.

Liked bullet 20 P-38E and the majority of the P-38s involved in the Aleutian campaign were 5-38E of the 54th F. These were the first Lightning lightnets to see combat. The first Lightning is connn over F-4 Photo Lightning of the 8th Photo Group based in Australia during April of 1942. The first P-38 Factory of the Second World War is needed to LT Sain Long. On 4 August 1942, LT Long. About down a Japanese four-engine Mvis flying boat over Dutch Harbor in the Aleutian Islands.

Later, many P-38E were sent to Lockhard rework facilities, such as the one at Lendog, Lobo, Portugal, where they were re-engined and brought up to P-38G standards. Ninety-nine P-38E airlines were also converted into F-4 photographic reconnaissance aircraft.

One novel plan was based on the P-38E. This involved converting the P-38E into a foolamine for use against the Japanese from final shapes. The aircraft was to be notified with drought, but filled foods allow it to be ferried out to sial based as the Pacific. In any event, the Battle of Midway changed the need for such an aircraft and the idea was shelved.

**Alcohed technica checks the ammunation feed chotes for the 50 caliber machine guns. The ammunation supply on the P-38E was increased from 200 rounds per gun (RPG) to 500 RPG, with 150 rounds being carried for the M1 2000 common. (Lockheed)**

P-38F (Model 222)

The P-38F differed from the P-38E in two major areas - its engines and fuel capacity. With the maximum weight now at over 19,000 pounds. Lockheed felt it necessary to increase the power of the Lightning by installing 1,225 bJm Silicon V-1710-49/35 engines. The decreased internal flat supply, in addition to more powerful engines, also led Lockheed to develop an underlying rploule capable of carrying onrance or fuel tanks.

The wing center section was stressed so that the P-38F could carry two of these pions each capable of carrying a 165 gallon drop tank, of a 1,000 pound bomb. One P-38F, actually one of the re-possessed Lightning Its, was used to test the Lightning's capability as a tored bomber. The aircraft was modified to carry two 1,900 pound aerial torpedos under the wings.

The first drop tanks were designed specifically for the P-38 by Kelly Johnson. Common standage was the critical area (combut area was the range to and from the target area, plus takeoff and landing and at least twenty minutes of combine over the target area). Count range with the 165 gallon drop tanks installed was approximately 1,000 miles. The increased range capability was further demonstrated during August of 1942 when Lockheed test pilot Millo Buchrani cruised over 3,000 miles using specially designed 300 gallon drop tanks.

Another change to the P-38F was in the manner in which the canopy opened. The earlier side-opening canopy top section was replaced with a rear ringed, upward, operating canopy top section (although a number of early production P-38F's came off the production line equipped with the side-opening canopy). The P-38F also used the "combut-flat" which was introduced to the lock-13 Fairship. The "combut flat" was simply a modification to the flag actuator that allowed the flaps deployed to maximize number of degrees at combat speeds. The use of the "combut flap" increased the lift and made the aircraft more maneuvable. The P-38F also had the pilot tube relocated from under the nose to a position under the power wing.

It was a P-38F that was converted into the first two-scatt capcipt. This modification was a piggy-back arrangement, with both pots very cramped under a standard P-38F canopy. The second pilot occupied the space normally used for the radio gear mounted behind the pilot. Several wave built rainters and several others were converted by field units as utility aircraft. Production of the P-38F totaled some 547 aircraft, of which twenty were converted to photo recon Miami. 80 aircraft(designated P-38F-31 and F-15) were ex-RAF Lightning Its with RAF serials running between AF21-744.

P-38J (Model 422)

With the P-38J, the Lightning would find slightly fulfill all the expectations that Kelly Johnson and the Army Air Force had envisioned for the aircraft. It was the late proto-iron P-38J that became the ultimate Lightning with great speed, power, altitude, maneuverability and reliability. Not counting the reconnaissance variants, Lockheed built 2/970 - 388J.

The P-38J differed from the earlier Lighting variants in having the turbo-super-barrier protocycles from inside the wing leading edge and replaced by a more efficient core-pipe interocorder mounted in a thin housing under the properties. This allowed much greater control over the superchargers, making the Allison V-170-F17 engine more reliable.

The radariod hostings were completely redesigned becoming both larger and more aerodynamic in shape. These two changes finally gave the P-38 pilot the full use of the power available to him from each Allison a total of 14.25 h and 24.000 feet.

In the extra space in the wing leading edge, Lockheed fitted a 62 gallon fuel tank, although not all P-38J has these leading edge teams. Those that did were marked with a cross on the fuselge beside the aircraft's data block.

Beginning with the P-38J-10, the windscreen was changed from the rounded style with an internal armor glass buildup at an external farmond 288-piece windscreen. Other cockpils changes included a novel count column with a dual gap half-wheel in place of the earlier automobile-type control wheel, improved heating and defrosting equipment and electrical system improvements (luses being replaced by circuit breakers).

The flight controls were modified in two stages, each of which made the P-38J more maneuverable and controllable. First, hydraulic boosters were added to the alicon conversion system, greatly increasing the roll rate of the 38J over earlier Lightning. With the "constant flaps" and hydraulistically-boosted alicon errors, the P-38J could maneuver with both out non-unmeasured the best single engine Second Word Warfighters.

The second stage of flight control modifications was the installation of the so-called "Life" shape (under the King Kelly Johnson always referred to them as "compressibility flags". From the very beginning of the P-88 program, the Lightning had been involved with a hazardous problem known as compressibility. With the great speed that a P-38 could build in a few, was quite possible, in fact probable, that the wing would suffer a high speed said and lose it.

When you look like you, you successfully and the P-38 then became a streamlined several aircraft that needs that best when the pilots start to north through compressibility did not have enough altitude to recover. The Army finally put out several circular restricting the day speeds on P-38, Worse, however, was the fact that German fighter pilots quickly learned the compressibility problems of the P-38 and used it to their advantage. The Germans would simply drive away from the P-38 noting the Lightning pilot would attempt to follow. If the other German pilot merely waited for the P-38 to gain enough speed for compressibility to take effect, then pull up and launch as the P-38 would gradually fuelently, in turn, try to follow the German maneuver.

Kelly Johnson knew what the problem was had by he would go about this, but he had to battle the Army and NACA to prove it. Army and NACA kept referring to the problem as tailier. Johnson was finally able to convince them that the problem was with sing lift, not in the elevator/trader controls. Johnson's answer was to add a set of additional "flaps" installed on the underside of the outer wing panel. These flaps had only two positions, either fully retracted or fully deployed.

Although the prototype version was hydraulically actuated, production versions were electrically operated. Either immediately before entering a dive, or immediately after starting the divie, the 7-38 pilot pushed the "divec recovery flap" button located on the control wheel. A small electric motor would rapidly extend a small two-piece flap into the airstream under each wing. These did not act as an air brake; they merely restored lift that was being lost to the effects of compressibility. The "dive recovery flaps" were introduced beginning with the P-38J-25. All subsequent models, including reconnaissance variants, had then an standard equipment. Additionally, during the block -25 production run, the landing light was moved from under the portouter wing to the leading edge of the port outer wing.

P-38L (Model 422)

The P-38L was the final production variant of the Lightning series and differed very little from the late production P-38L. The major change was in power plants. The P-38L was powered by the 1.600 Hz Allison V-17-D38L and -F30L engines. Additionally the armament was changed with the addition of underting 4's much rocket launched "trees." These replaced the earlier twin, three tube barcos up leunches and an experimental undvering zero-length launcher stub that had been fitted to the outer wing panel.

There were several equipment changes including the addition of the AN/APS-13 tail warf near and mounting the gun camera in the leading edge of the left underwing bomb/drop trackyn.04 total of 3/24/9-38L were built by Lockheced and 113 new light at the Consolidated-Volute Plan in Nashville before production was halted by the end of the war.

The Sht Air Force in England operated four P-38 fighter groups, the 20th, 55th, 364th and 479th. Since the P-38 was the most easily recognized aircraft in the Allied air Forces, it was the P-38 that was charged with air defense over the Normandy landing (several were still shot down by Allied gunnets). By July of 1944, there of these Groups had transitioned to the P-51 Mustang leaving the 479th as the sole remaining P-38 group.

P-38M Night Lightning

To meet the Army's need for a night interior aircraft, several types were tried such as the British Bristol Beaughter and defuxilland Mosquito, both obtained on a reverse LED Lead Lease from the RAF. Another type deployed to the Pacific was the Douglas P-70, a conversion of the A-20 Haxo lighten. In any event, none of these adequately met the Army's requirements.

In the Pacific, there had been several feedback rooms of standard-38 fighter plants to the high-tiginer role. The most successful of these P-38 conversions show one by members of the 6th Night Fighter Squadron on New Guinea. The 6th NY mounted by SCR-840 Airborne Intercept (At) radar units (Long H, P-70) into modified P-38 drop tanks. These were mounted on a pair of P-38GCs and both aircraft were also modified to have a second person in the space behind the pilot card nominally occupied by radio equipment. The 54TH NY used a pair of single-set P-38 that were converted by Western Electric of the installation of a US. Navy AN/APS-41 radar pad under the wing. One of these P-38 high-tiginer's later shared a victory with a P-61 Black Widow crew from the same unit.

These converted aircraft, however, were viewed as stop gap measures and none met the AAF needs for a true night-fighter. As a result, the Army and Lockheed began development of a production P-38 night-fighter during 1944. This involved the conversion of a single-sear P-38I with an AN/APS-41 radar pad mounted under the nose on a modified bomb python. The prototype aircraft was built at Wright Field, home of the SAAAF Development Center. Several P-38J were converted and tested both in the US. and under combat conditions in the Pacific.

Finally, during late October of 1944, Army contracted Lockheed's Dallas Modification Center to build the production night-fighter under the designation P-38M. Seventy five aircraft were taken from the P-38L production line and sent to the Dallas facility where the following modifications were made: a modified undergoing nylon was installed under the nose to mount an AN/APS-41 radar pad, the copper extra was reconfigured to a full second cockpit with a new raised bubb occupancy over the radar operator and flash flashes were added to the guns. On 5 January 1945, the first P-38M made its adjacent flight.

The final timing of P-38M Night Lightning crews was done at Hammer Field, California, during early 1945, Hammer Field was also the training base for P-61 Black Widow crews. Training of the initial cross was finished during the early Summer of 1945, however, the war ended before any aircraft or crews were actually deployed into combat.

Four of the overall Gloss Black \(p\)-38M and their crew were part of the USAAF Occupation Forces In Japan as part of the 48th Night Fighter Squadron based atAngu, Japan, during early 1946. By March of 1946, however, the 418th NFS was back on Okinawa where the P-38M Night Lightnings were phased out of service.

## Photo Reconnaissance Lightnings

It was obvious from the beginning of the Second World War that aerial reconnaissance was going to be as important, if not more important, than both the bombardment and fighter missions. The Allied commanders had to know where the target was, what its defenses were, if it was camouflaged and what surrounded it. Following the attack, it was necessary to find out if the target had been eliminated or if it needed to be attacked again.

With the vastness of the war, it was obvious that most of the reconnaissance would have to be prepared by long range aircraft. During 1941 only the bomber types, like the B-17 and B-24 could fulfill the long range reconnaissance mission. The bomber types had some serious drawbacks: they were big, slow and, operating alone, were an easy prey for energy filters. What the USAFA needed was a high speed, long range aircraft built strictly for the reconnaissance mission. During early 1941, the P-38 was the only aircraft that met these requirements.

The Army Air Force and Kelly Johnson came to the conclusion that a modified P-3BE, with its guns replaced by aerial cameras, would be the best aircraft for the reconnaissance mission. Although many aircraft were modified throughout the war and pressed into service as reconnaissance aircraft, it was the P-38 Photo Lightning that was known as the best reconnaissance aircraft of the Second World War --in any air for forest During the Fall 1941 Kelly Johnson had Lockheed's mechanics removing some system from a P-3BE and replaced it with a pair of twenty-four inch focal length K-17 vertical format cameras.

A second aircraft was built during December of 1941 and, after the outbreak of the war, the reconnaissance mission was quickly brought to the forefront. Production of reconnaissance conversions actually outstripped fighter production during January 1942 and by the end of the war, Lockheed had built over 1,400 Photo Lightnings.

## F-4-1-Lo

The first two Photo Lightnings were delivered during December of 1941 under the designation F-4-1-Lo. The F-4-1-Lo was a standard P-38e airframe modified with a pair of K-17 feed vertical cameras in place of the fighter's guns and amunition. The gun ports in the nose cap were simply covered with sheet metal patches. Although the majority of F-4-s were unarmed, a number of F-4-1-LOs and F-4As retained a pair of 50 caliber machine guns.

The F-4-1-Lo was the first production Lightning variant to be fitted with underlying fuel tanks. Almost all of the photo reconnaissance light was retually modifications of standard fighter airframes. The modification work was carried out at Lockheed's Dallas, Texas, modification center.

During 1941 Lockheed built 205 P-38fighters and two F-4-1-LOs. During January of 1942-4 Production outstripped fighter production eighty-four to thirty-two. The first F-4-1-LO missions were flow during April of 1942 by members of LTCCon. Karl "Pop" Polifka's A Flight of the 8th Photo Reconnaissance Squadron. It was Polifka flying an F-4-1-LO that spotted the Japanese task force bound for Port Moreshy on 7 May 1942. This mission led directly to the Battle of the Corial Sea and the first defeats for the Japanese Navy. Besides use by the USAAF, three F-4-1-LOs were built and delivered to the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) for service in the Southwest Pacific. A total of ninety-nine F-4-1-LOs were built at Dallas.

## F-4-1

Like the F-4-1-LO, the F-4-A-1 was based on the P-38e airframe. The F-4-A-1 differed from the earlier variant in the camera installation. The F-4-A-1 had a six inch focal length K-17 internogram (vertical and oblique) camera array which made it necessary to add a pair of square windows (one on each side) in the camera bay doors. There were a total of twenty F-4-1-LOs converted.

## Xf-5-5D

The XF-5D was a conversion of an F-5-A-10 with a single vertical camera and a photo-majorator in the empty gun compartment. The second crewman had a small bubble canopy in place of the nose. The XF-5D also retained two-50 caliber machine guns in the nose. A second K-24 camera was to be installed in the rear of one of the booms.The aircraft was similar to the P-38D Droop Snoot and only one aircraft was modified.

### F-5a-1

Based on the P-38G airframe, the F-5A-1 was a great improvement over the earlier F-4A with more available horsepower, better cameras and better camera mounts. Twenty late production P-38Gs were converted, with the first aircraft being delivered during August of 1942.

## F-5a-3

There were only 20 F-5A-3s converted from P-38G-1 airframes.

## F-5a-10

The F-5A-10 was a conversion of the P-38G-10 and was the photo reconnaissance workhorse of the 12th Air Force in Italy. There were a total of 140 F-5A-10s built.

### F-5b-1

F-5b-1s were converted from P-38I- airframes and were the first Lightnings to be fitted with the Sperry autopilot. There were several different F-5 camera configurations, but the most common consisted of two six inch K-17 oblique cameras, a twelve or twenty-four inch K-17 vertical camera (center section) and a K-18 twenty-four inch vertical camera (era section). There were a total of 200 F-5B-1s built.

### F-5c-1

Lackheed converted a total of 128 P-38I-5 airframes to F-5C-1 specifications.

### F-5e-2

F-5e-2s were converted from P-38I-15 airframes, with 100 aircraft being modified at Dallas. The F-5e-2 normally carried three K-17 vertical cameras and a pair of K-22 oblique cameras. One F-5e-2, named Dot-Dash, was the first combat aircraft to complete a shuttle mission from an English base to a base in Soviet-held territory.

### F-5e-3

Lackheed converted a total of 105 P-38I-25s to F-5e-3 variants.

### F-5e-4

The F-5e-4 was the first photo reconnaissance variant based on the P-38L airframe. The F-5e-4 differed from earlier photo variants in that it was equipped with four K-17 trimtertopos cameras. Lockheed built a total of 508 F-5e-4, all of which had the same improvements as the P-38L.

### F-5f-3

An unknown number of P-38L-5 airframes were converted at Dallas to F-5f-3 standards. The F-5f-3 differed from other F-5s in the extended camera bay.

### F-5g

The F-5g was a conversion of the P-38L-5 airframes, complete with the left pylon gun camera mount, underwing dive recovery flaps, and the wing leading edge fuel tanks. The nose was completely reshaped and housed four standard cameras plus a forward oblique camera in the nose cap. The F-5g also had an ADF loop antenna mounted under the fuselage behind the nose landing gear well. The Dallas Modification Center built a total of sixty-three F-5Gs.

Besides use by the Army Air Force, there were four F-5s of varying sub-types transferred to the U.S. Navy in North Africa. The Navy designated these aircraft as FO-1 (BuNos 01209, 210, 211 and 212). The aircraft were flow from land bases for long range reconnaissance missions over the Mediterranean Sea.

Several F-4f-5 aircraft, including a squadron of the latest F-5g, were flown by the Free French Air Force. The French Air Force crews were trained by U.S. Army Air Force plots in the F-4-1-LO and the French flew their first missions in North Africa on 27 July 1943.

## Drop Snoot

The P-38 Drop Snoot was the brainchild of COL Cass Hough and COL Don Ostrander of 8th Air Force Headquarters. The load-carrying capability of the P-38 made a natural for use as a fighter-bometer. The latter P-38 watanirs (P-388/IL) had the capability of carrying up to 4000 pounds of ordinance -- the same as a B-I/T bomberi.

Cosh Hough and Ostrander came up with the idea of using some type of "Leader" P-38 for level bombing missions. The advantages of using a fighter in the strategic bomber role were obvious: a much higher speed to and from the target, one tenth as many crew members involved in the incision, and fighter scout during the withdrawal phase was not required. What they proposed was the installation of a Norber bombing in a Model P-38, one housing a qualified bombardier/navigator in the aircraft's empty gun.

The project, given the code name DROSO or SNOOT, was formulated at Lockheed s Landerdog modification center in Northern Ireland. A P-38H was modified by removal of the armament section in the nose, including the gun front nose cap. In this piece a solid was too much easy, and shaped like the proposed bombard nose. With some ballat added, the modified P-38H was flight tested to determine if there were any flaws in its flight characteristics. After successfully completing the flight tests, Lockheed modified a new production P-38 foil by roll Drop Snoot prototype specification.

The wooden nose of the P-38H test aircraft was used to construct a Plegals bubble bombardier nose. Armpt was added to the sidson and floor of the bombardier compartment, along with the Norber bombinished, related bombing equipment, oxygen and navigational equipment. During late February of 1944 the P-38Drop Snoot was rolled out at Lungford Lodge.

The concept was so successful that the 8th Air immediately ordered first three, then fifteen Drop Snoot conversions. The total number built lies somewhere between twenty-three (hoe-38Js) acquired out of Lampdidge and 100 (the number of Drop). Snoot conversion works for the A-Y. The first combat mission was flow by the P-38H feature Group on 1 April 1944, who a Drop Snoot forty-two-shot 20h. FG P-38Js on an attack against the Luffuffuff base at Gurettosh, Germany. Drop Snoot missions were not confined to just 7-83 wells. COL Hud Zemle used a Drop Snoot P-38J to lead its 56h F6D Tumbedts on at leastone bombing mission. Additionally, more than one Drop Snoot was built as a push VIP aircraft without bombing equipment.

### Pathfinder

Another idea along the same lines as the Drop Snoot conversion was the P-38J/L Pathfinder aircraft. This was a Lockheed factory development involving the installation the AN/P-38'Bombing Through Overett (BTO) radar unit, commonly known as a "Mickey" radar, in an modified P-38J/I. In nose, an entirely new, extended bulbous nose was fitted to a standard P-38J fighter during mid-1944. The new nose had shadows cut into the area above the radar bombardier station and the bulbous nose was covered by an OPERISA bubble --similar to that used for early P-61 rademoles. Inside the modified nose was the same equipment as found in a P-38 Drop Snoot except at the Norberai stonal bombing was replaced by the BTO radar and is associated control panels.

Although the prototype was a modified P-38J, most production Pathfinders were of P-38J. Afterwards it is believed that these aircraft were designated as P-38L-3. Several were built at Lockheed's Modification Center in Dallas, then sent to the combat theaters where they were used in both the radar bombing and radar mapping roles.
