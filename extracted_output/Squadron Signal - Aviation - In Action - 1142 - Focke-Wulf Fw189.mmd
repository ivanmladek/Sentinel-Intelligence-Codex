bocons ended with stressed skin fins and rudders and were joined by a single piece horizontal stabilizer and elevator. The outer wing panels were connected to the booms and were joined to the center wing box by three wing spans. The fully detectable handling gear was hydraulically operated and the tail wheel was also retractable, folding to starboard to lay flat on the under-surface of the horizontal tail plane. The first prototype (registered D-OVPN) made its madler flight, joined by Kurt Tank, in July of 1993, some fifteen months after the current was let.

By the end of 1938, the first prototype (FW 189 V1) had been joined by two others (FW 189 V2) [registered D-OVPN in August and the FW 189 V3 (registered D-ORMH) in September). The FW 189 V2 was basically similar to the FW 189 V1 but was equipped for an armament trials with an armament of three 7.980M M5 machine pairs. One on was mounted on in the front of the cabin, another was mounted in a flexible position above the cabin and was fired by the wireless operator. The third gun was mounted in the conical rear guner's position. Additionally, there were two fixed 7.980M M 17 machine guns mounted in wing roots and fired by the pilot.

The third prototype (Werk Nr.1999) featured automatic variable-pitch Argus propellers in place of the fixed pitch propellers used on the earlier prototypes and production (also known as Standard) 43.41 engines.

The successful outcome of the flight test program with the three prototypes resulted in an order for four additional prototypes. The first of this series, the FW 189 V4 (D-OCHO-Werk 0.0001) was the first model of the planned series production for 189A. The machine had some minor changes such as modified engine cowlings, semi-covolved anf which, as enlarged tail wheel and the defensive armament was restricted to a pair of MG 15 machine guns. This aircraft was used to conduct a number of trials with special equipment, such as the Type 152 embryo-screen equipment and spray containers for spreading poison gas and other chemical warfare agents.

The next aircraft, the FW 189 V5, was the first model of the intended FW 1898 series trainer with an aerodynamically refined fusage needle. The original fusage was replaced by a heavy armored cock for the pilot and rear gunter. The pilot was seated back to back with the gunter.

**The third prototype was originally registered D-ORMH before being given the Luttwite radio call sign (A3+F1). The FW 189 V featured a single leg on main landing gear and was powered by Standard As 410 engines with variable pitch propellers. (Emmersorted)**

**The second prototype was designated the FW 189 V2 and given the registration D-OCHO. The y 2 prototype was similar to the FW 189 V1 but was equipped with armament trials. The two teams under the wing wing when the (c) are bomb tracks. (Hans-Heit Stapelf)**

At the end of 1939, the FW 189 V1 had been pulled out of the flight testing and had been converted for the assault or close-support role under the designation FW 189 V1b. The original muscle was replaced by an small armored muscle where the pilot and gunter are back to back. The pilot was putted by armed glass panels and sat in an armored seat. The gunter's seat was almost armed and he was provided with a single 7.980M M5 15 machine gun. Later, another prototype of the assault variant was built under the designation FW 189 V6. This new model was intended to be the prototype for the series production the FW 189 V8.

The last prototype was ordered as a sealmate. This variant, the FW 189 V7, employed a similar fusage and was in the FW 189 V5, but was configured with twin flouts. This aircraft was not finished and was later converted to the FW 1890 configuration.

At one point, a radial step opening variable from beamed which was to have been powered by a pair of 700 phoneone line 14M 4/5'stone cylinder at cooled radial engines'. One Few 189A-1 airframe was converted to take these engines at Chatillon-sur-Sense by SCASO. The aircraft was powered for production under the designation row 1896; however, the prototype smoked while being ferried to Germany for evaluation during early 1943 and the program was scrapped. After repairs, the prototype was given the registration GH+RO and was taken for Fieldmansh Kesseling as his personal courier aircraft entering service in May of 1943.

**The FW 189 VI prototype was rebuilt with an entirely amored fusage as the prototype for an armored assaulticlose support variant of the FW 189 with the designation FW 189 Vib. The aircraft was later lost during a demonstration in early 1943.**

## Focke Wolf **Fw I89A**

During the Spring of 1940, Focke Wolf received production orders for ten pre-production F87 189A-0s, the be followed by twenty production F87 189A-1s. The F89A-1 was basically similar to the Fw 189V4 prototype with some additional aerodynamic refinement of the engine vollings and a twin leg main underaccione. Amman was standardized at a pair of forward firing MO 17s and the flexible MO 5s machine guns, one for the observer at a second gun for the rear gunter. Additionally, four ETC 50VIII bomb tracks were installed under the outburst when capsule of carrying four 154 percent (70 kg) SC 50 beams. The GV length length length could be used for both horizontal and blue bunching. The aircraft was also equipped to carry the 152 _NanoDebachare_ surface generator. Normal reconnaissance equipment was on RB 2003 camera, other optical institutions included the RB 50X0, RB 21/18 of the RR 15/18 cameras. The crew also had a Type HK 12.5 or HK 19 hand-held camera. Normally, in a F025 radio wave installed along with a 450 pupps. For night reconnaissance, since, the aircraft could carry photodins bombs. The crew of the F89A-1 was comprised of a pilot, observer-navigator/radio-opearance/dorsal gunter and the flight mechanic/craper gunter.

The ten pre-production and twenty production aircraft were built all in the company's facilities in 2016, Germany. The service evaluation of the pre-production Fw 189A-0 reconnaissance aircraft was progressing and reports on the aircraft were excellent. The _Prokmann de Zarfabekirde_ (OKL) had finally realized that the HS 126 had reached the end of its usefulness and assigned the Fw 189A-0 remain a high priority and a second assembly line was established at the Arec-Avia factory in Czechowlais. One reason for this switch **An Fw 189A-1 (Wr. Nr. 0032) undergoes final assembly in the Focke Wolf plant in **Bremen**, Germany. The engine continues for the _Argus_ as 414 or cooled engines are open for final checks of the aircraft's power plants. The **Fw 189A-1** different from the **Fw 189A-1** in that it featured a twin leg main landing gear for additional **strength**. **(Emmeristorfer)**was because the assembly lines in Bremen were taken over with production of the Fw 190 fighter.

By late Summer of 1940, the factory of Bremen had handed over thirty-eight Fw 189s to the Lauffured and during 1941 a further sixty-one Fw 189A-1s were produced. During this time period, the Arcw works delivered 151 machines to the Lauffured and towards the end of the year, component parts were being delivered from Bremen to captured aircraft factories in Borkaran, France so that production of the N89A coal began at this location. The final assembly of German would sub-assembly vehicles was carried out at work ago as Meignez.

By the Spring of 1942, substantial numbers of Fw 189A-1s had arrived to re-equip operational

_AblazinessoftoftA_ (H) recomassurance units in the field. The priority for re-equipment was for units serving on the Eastern Front (where Fw 189 was to see most of its service). During 1942, the factory of Bremen had a total of fifty-seven aircraft, the Arcw-axis words produced 183 aircraft and the feeders Borkaran turned out some eight eighty-seven aircraft. By the Spring of 1943, the French group of factories had taken over the production of the Fw 189 from the factory at Bremen with the German and Czech factories phasing out production (even aircraft built at Bremen and three at Prague).

During mid-1941, production was shifted from the Fw 189A-1 to the Fw 89A-2. The only external difference between the two variants was the arrangement of the Fw 189A-2 differed only in having strengthened defective weapons. The single MO 15 machine guns were replaces by MG 812 (twin MG 81 guns). These machine guns had a rate of five of some 3,600 rounds per

\(\sim\)The Fw 189A-3 was a dual-control pilot rather built in small numbers alongside the Fw 189A-2. The final A series variant were Fw 189A-4 which differed from the earlier versions in having the wing root machine guns replaced with MG FF 20MM custom. Additionally, light armer was added beneath the engines, fuselage and fuel tanks for the low level technical reconnaissance and close support role.

**Pairs of 465 bp Argus AS 410 air-cooled, inverted Vee engines rest on transport dollles ready for installation on completed Fw 189A-1 airframes at the Focke Wuit plant in Bremen, Germany.**The coupling on the Fe iv 198A- differed from the Fe iv 198A prototype in that it deleted the air intake on the side of the cowling, improving overall aerodynamics. The exhausts were changed from individual stacks used on the Fe iv 198 VI to an exhaust collector with a single exhaust on the lower portion of each side of the cowling. (Emmerstorfer) The twelve cylinder Avgas engines drove Avgas two blade, controllable pitch properties. The tuned propeller who was the pitch control for the propeller. The landing gear differed from the prototypes in that it was a twin leg rather than single leg design. (Emmerstorfer)

The FV 18 could carry a four such bombs for a total bomb load of 440 pounds. Normally, the FV 189 was used for visualizationographic reconnaissance missions, and was ready used for bombing missions. Aircraft on the Eastern Front, however, were used for missions against Russian Partisans, bombing supply dumps, base camps and personnel whenever they were caught in the open.

The Fw 189A-1 was armed with a single 7.9au MG 17 machine gun is to collect the shelf casings. The gasless weapon was fed from drum magazines that could be quickly changed in flight. There were racks for spare magazines alongside the gunner and in the fuseluge below the top truret.

Experience in combat with the Fw 189A-1 led to an increase in the defensive armament on the Fw 189A-2. The rear gunner's position was modified with a MG 812 twin 7.9au machine gun being installed in place of the earlier single MG 17 installation.

Focke-Wulf Fw 189B

The Fw 189 Bv 5 prototype, was intended to serve as the test vehicle for the planned Fw 189B trainer series. This variant differed from the Fw 189A in that had a new fuselage with dual controls. With its primary role of training, the Fw 189B had all its armament deleted. After the completion of test flying with the Fw 189 V5, the three-production Fu 190B-0s were ordered along with ten production Fu 189B-119 Games. If the five set aircraft were completed during early 1940 and delivered to the Luftawfte units.

The role of machines was originally intended to be night fighting and wireless operator training, and the inside the fuselage was packed with instruments and radio panels for each student crew position. All Fw 189B were powered by the Standard Argos A 410 engines driving automatic variable-pitch procedures. Later, most of the aircraft were modified with a reinforced main undertaking. A number of the aircraft were used in the courier roles and, from time to time, were used as VIP aircraft for high ranking Luftawfte personnel.

**(Right) This was one of the early pre-production Fu 189B-0 with an early engine installation without the side air intakes. The aircraft had the Luftawfte radio codes, B0-A/Z on the tail booms in Black.There were only three Fu 189B-0s built (Nourara)**

**Fuselage Development**

**This Fw 189B-1 was assigned to a training squadron and carried an overall Gray camou-fage with the radio codes, B5-A/Z in Black. This is an early Fu 189B-1-with the single leg main landing gear. Besides its Italian rote, the Fu 189B also served as a lision and VIP aircraft for high ranking Luftawfte officials. (Emmerstore)**

## Focke Wolf Fw 189C

Late in 1938, the Fw 189 VII was returned to the company work shop for conversion to the close supermassful role. The aircraft that the original fuselage removed and replaced by an entirely new small room armed center fuselage with increased armed plating and heavier armement. The prototype was re-designed the Fw 189 Vlb and began flight testing in the Spring of 1939. Flight tests soon revealed that the handling characteristics were unsatisfactory, the take-off weight had increased dramatically and the forward vision through the small armer glass panels was bad. Additionally, the summer half difficulty in seeing an aircraft behind the Fw 189 Vlb. As a result, the aircraft was restored to the factory for modification.

The cockpit armer glass panels were enlarged, the rear view for the gnurter was replaced by an armored enclosure with additional view panels. After these modifications, the Fw 189 Vlb, was given a new registration and radio code NA+BW. The aircraft was used to undertake comparative trials with the assuit/code support Herschel B18. The results of these trials were inconclusive, since the flight qualities of Focke Wolf were no better like the Hs 129. Shortly after the trials, the Fw 189 Vlb was lost during a demonstration at Bremen. The accident was caused by a rear collision with a building during landing. The pilot was injured in the resulting bally landing and the aircraft was written off.

Interestingly, the Fw 189 III had gained some support from Lluftawfel officials and as a result another prototype, the Fw 189V (registered D-OPWN), was considered to serve as the prototype for the proposed Fw 189 Casal/code-support aircraft. This prototype was completed in early 1940. The Fw 189V central fuselage neck similar to the proposed proposed Proseu Watt technicians work on the Fw 189 Vcb prototype in the Focke Watt factory in Bremen, Germany, during 1940. The Fw 189 Vbs was intended to serve as the prototype for the Fw 189c assuit/code support variant. The aircraft did not go into series production, mainly due to its high costs. (Emmerstorfer)

In December of 1941 de German 9th Army gave up Kalinin and Soviet troops started a counter-attack. Because of the extreme cold, preparing aircraft for missions in the field was extremely difficult and there were shortages of spare parts, fed and personnel. As a result, the short-range reconnaissance units were once again recognized with a further reduction of independent squadness.

In May of 1942, the German 17th Army and the lt Armored(Tank) Army counter-attacked and managed to surround most of Timoshenko's Army attacking from the South. This action gave the Germans some breathing space to replace losses and re-equiting units.

In air combat, the structure of the FeV 189 was proven to be robust and able to withstand considerable battle damage. In one action on 19 May 1942, two MIG-3 fighters attacked a Fw 189 at 13,123 fGet (4,000m) four the Tamain peninsula. They shot out the petr engine and scrost his on the wing/bom joint cantains the engine to separate from the aircraft. The flight mechanic and radio-operator's weapons were also out of action. Luckily the fighters broke off and even though heavily damaged, the FW 198 was able to return for a crash landing at a four-ward airfield. When they landed, the port landing gear collapsed using still further damage to the wing. After installing a new engine and repairing the wing tip, the aircraft was returned to service.

The German 11th Army took possession of Kerson peninsula and occupied the whole Krim peninsula during July of 1942. Sovier forces willinger towards Staliograd, recreating from the German troops that had broken through a frostow. The German 6th Army completely destroyed the 62nd Soviet Army and lt Tank Army in the wetlands of Klatsh. On 15 August 15 _Gendelwer_ Pants started his attempt to occupy Staliograd. The Staliograd rampal led the toss of a number of FW 1989, On 18 September 1942, an FeV 189 of 6 (B4I), secured by four in 190 fighters, was conducting an artillery spotting mission over Staliograd when the German formation was attacked by Soviet fighters. The FW 189 was hit by the fighter blown by Ivan Balyvik and tried to escape. The aircraft was hit by fire from the Soviet flight commander, Del Montlykh, causing the port wing to fall and the Fw 189 enschard, killing _Gendelwer_ Mardard Kohle and Staliogradfed Friedrich Lesska. Another aircraft was lost on 19 November when it was attacked by a Soviet fighter which scored his on the starboard wing setting i on fire. The aircraft rolled inverted and dove into the ground.

The aircraft carries velocity bands on the full booms and the wingtip out of the national landing is also Yellow. These Yellow markings were recognition markings applied to aircraft operating on the Eastern Front. (Petrick)**

The aircraft went out of control and the crew, _Offerberberberber_. _Linearfilter_ Schmidt and _Grefier_ Sowa successfully build out although they were injured.

As of 2 February 1943, the Lathwaffe had lost 488 aircraft and 1,000 air crews in the region. _Grouped crewment_ reheat **An Fw 198 for another reconnaissance mission on a grass landing ground in Russia during the Summer of 1943.

Three days later Liquid and Castain reported shooting down a twin fuselike aircraft above Marinka. LTs Marcel Albert and Albert Preficios also attacked a reconnaissance aircraft above Brusa-Mekoyaro et al. (2014), destroying the aircraft. The German attack stopped a Harlow on 12 July and the Soviet counter-attack began at Oel. For 1892 reconnaissance flights reported all of the Soviet movements of troops in time, but the Germans had no reserves to defend against these advances.**

Two days later, Belogorst vermeered and five Soviet Ames began to move forward. The Soviet Air Force also deployed several new fisheries including the Lavrochia Ls-5th resembled the Fev 190 and caused recognition problems for the Fev 189 eyes. We 1896 tried to get through the front-line by flying at very low altitude, but the sheer numbers of Soviet fighters and anti-arcraft guns halted the entire German reconnaissance effort for extended periods.

During the Soviet Summer offensive, the Soviet Air Force deployed yet another new fighter, the Yak-3. With the introduction of this excellent level register, Fu 1895 requests would require additional fighter sectors. At this time, Fu 1898 began to undertake night reconnaissance missions and had special equipment installed to allow them to operate at night or had weather. They continued to conduct only visual reconnaissance and rarely deployed photo flash bombs, as these would betray their positions to enemy gamers. As of 10 April 1994, _LaPflate 6_ reported that the following units were equipped with Fu 1898: NAGG.4 (eight Fu 1894).

The bulges on the wing were maintenance access panels for the main wing attachment points.**(189s), NAGF.10 (twelve Fw 189s), NAGF.15 (fithen Fw 189s) and 4,(HJ31 (seven Fw 189s)). Additionally, there were two aircraft assigned to LNING 100.

From the Summer of 1944 on the Focke Wall Fw 189 could not be used in the tactical reconnaissance code, even with strong fighter sectors since the aircraft were considered high priority targets for enemy fighters. For 189s were also used in the propagation work. They took large numbers of handballs into action and on one mission a radio-operator downed a Soviet fighter by releasing a white cloud of handballs causing the pilot to loose control and crash. The Fw 189s used for right flights remained in service during the Summer of 1944. Some runs now operated a mix of aircraft and several free Fw 189s, along with BT 109s/s, Fw 1903s and Fw 1105s.

In Finland, _Fieselfinder Nonfi_(O) _Lafaflte 5_ was engaged in heavy action. Among the 2014 Hurricane aircraft in Finland, were seven Fw 189s of 1,(HJ32  stationed at Kemijlavi, Alkaturti and Pearson. These aircraft participated in reconnaissance missions along the Murnmass railway line, along with conducting support missions, including bombissing missions and leaflet offs all along the front-line. During the first weeks of May, the unit lost a Fw 189 in a take-off action. I have, the aircraft of L(J)B3' were engaged in secret missions for XX Army Luffittelten-Verbindung.

### Slovakian Air Force

The German established Slovakia Air Force was equipped with modern German aircraft to be used on the Eastern front against the Sovits. The Slovakian Air Force received a total of fourteen Fu 1898-2s to Fontt's at tactical reconnaissance squadron for service on the Eastern Front.

During 1942/43, this unit was in combat in the Krima area, but during the Slovakian upsising of the late Summer of 1944, the Slovakian flyers were ordered to return to their home air buses. On the other air flyers of Tokyo Dabsy. A number of aircraft had been gathered to support the inaugerer forces, including several Fu 1989. German air superiority, however, quickly overcame this small force. The upsising was soon quelled and on 31 August 1944, the last six Fu 1898 flevor the Soviet Union loaded with Slovakian fugitives.

(vis Hans-Heit Stapfer)Royal Romanian Air Force

The Fw 189 first entered service as a trainer to convert reconnaissance pilots from single engine into twin engine aircraft. Until the arrival of the Fw 1988, Romanian pilots had flown the IAR-29 and Hs 129. The first Fw 189s were put into service at Galac, where a flying school was set up. Operational training was completed at Kiroszynski in the Soviet Union, where Grupp 8 Assault (Shut Battle Group) was stationed between May and August of 1944. These machines usually retained their original German camortingale scheme and radio codes.

In the Summer of 1944, the group began night flying training on the airfields at Ard (Oraeda) and Teece. This training was conducted for every selected to man night fighter and night reconnaissance aircraft. These plans were not to be put into action because on 23 August 1944, advancing troops found several abandoned Fw 189 on airfields destered by the retracting German forces. These aircraft were later handed over to the Red Air Force.

## Royal Bulgarian Air Force

The Bulgarian Air Force received a number of Fw 189As to re-equip their short range reconnaissance units. These aircraft saw action on the Russian Front during 1943 and carried the Cross of St Andrew on the fuselage in Black against a White background.

## Royal Hungarian Air Force

During the Spring of 1943 it became obvious that the Hungarian short-range reconnaissance squadrons, which were equipped with Heinkel He 46 and Weiss Manford W.M.21, were obsolete and in need of re-equipment. The German High Command decided that it was important to upgrade the allied air forces that were to serve along side Luffuffarite units.

The crew shot down two of the glithers and managed to escape back to friendly territory.
* [28] By the end of October, the Hungarian unit recorded its 1,000th sorie. And until the end of the year, the unit was in constant action. The number of control stories was reduced; however, because of a lack of operational aircraft. Between May December, some sixty aircraft had received battle damage, mainly from Soviet ground fire, although another twelve had been damaged by crew fighting. By the time the unit moved back into Hungary in March of 1944, it had only one operational aircraft remaining and 3/1 Squadron was disbanded.
* [29] O. 1 April 1994, the 48th Sorege Remosaicing Squadron arrived from Hungary at Bromberg (Bydos) led by CAPT Jossef Fnumberhoff. This squadron was trained in night flying and instrument flight under poor weather conditions. The unit was known as the _Eewitecar All-Haber Assibding_ and was to be used in the "twilight" reconnaissance role. On 18 May, their training was completed and they began operations (some missions had already been flown while still in training) The unit's area of operations was between Delatin and Kolomea. In early April, they five to Zamos in Poland to support the Intel Huongnan Army. This action resulted in high losses. Their last operational move was to Unayt(Ushaped in Russia) and from there they transferred to Goldello, under Budapest in September. Here they handed over their aircraft to the Germans. During their operational career, the squadron had lost ten-element aircraft, five to Soviet figures and one to an operational accident (weather, the next were to ground fire.

During the last few months of the war, Hungarian Air Force short-range reconnaissance forces were undergoing conversion training for the Messerschmitt BF 109, but the war ended before this was complete.

## Last Flights

Focke Wolf Fe 189 aircraft remained in training units and some were used for fusion missions up until the end of the war. The last Lafrawfle Fw 189 losses were reported by Stab L/NAG.5 on 8 May 1945. The squadron reported that Fw 189A-2 W. Nr. 2274 (024Z8B) and Fw 189A-2 W. Nr.12535 (024Z8R) were both from Roalthoff-Swedon on the date. At least one Fw 189 was used as a hack by the Royal Flying Establishment in England after the war. After its usefulness had past, the aircraft was placed into storage at RAF Brize Norton. Unfortunately, the aircraft was later destroyed in a pale.
