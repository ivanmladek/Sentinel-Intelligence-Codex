## Introduction

Today the Mid-23/27 Flugger series equips more Soviet fighter and attack regiments than any other Soviet fighter in service. In Europe, there are an estimated one thousand Froggers in the Both Soviet and WASAW Patc service deployed opposite TAO forces. The Mid-23 was the first swing using aircraft built by the Midz ORB and over the years the Floger has proven itself to be a simple and reliable aircraft, serving in both the fighter and attack role.

The roots of the Mid-23/23 variable geometry or swing using design date back to the early 1960s when a number of countries were investigating the merits of the variable geometry wing. The swing wing had been recognized by the Midz ORB as the best way of overcoming the primary shortcomings of the Mid-21 Fishberg fiber: i.e., short range and small weapons load. Fully spread, the swing wing offered a shorter takeoff/landing until only carriage having aerospons load. In the fully swept, the wing allowed for a high to speed and good supersonic handling characteristics.

The swing wing, however, also had some disadvantages. The construction of the swing sweep mechanism required a larger fuselage and is relatively heavy. Additionally, the variable wing and its mechanical planes a higher demand on maintenance crews.

The Soviet Union was not the only country that appreciated the advantages of a swing wing filter. In England, Vickers-Armstrong had designed a practical swing wing wing aircraft. The British government, however, had no interest in such project and all research data was transferred to the United States National Air and Space Administration's (NASA) Larsen Research Center.

This data was instrumental in the early development of the General Dynamics TEX project, which evolved into the F-11-15. Since the beginning of the Cold War, the Soviet had tried to obtain information, documents, research data and hardware on new American projects through both official and unofficial channels and the TEX/F-111 project was no exception.

All research data obtained on the TEX project was carefully examined by Soviet Acquiring, including those at the Central Aerodynamics and Hydodynamics Institute (TaNG4) in Moscow whose substantial research work on a Soviet swing wing fighter had already been done. This data, both the undefusion of the TEXproject and the original Soviet research data, was provided to the Sukhou and MidG OAKs for use in developing new fighter projects. These projects were not in competition with each other and were aimed at totally different requirements. While Sukhou's goal was to improve the kicked/landing performance of the Su-T Filter ground attack series, the MGORB's goal was to design a completely new interceptor/fighter series.

MiG's project was much more radical. The new fighter was to be a replacement front of the Mid-21 Fishberg with greatly improved range, weapons load and better takeoff/ landing capabilities, establishing a new trend in the Soviet Union toward multi-role aircraft.

Not quite sure if the swing wing project would be a success, the MGO OkB also developed a delta wind prototype using roughly the same fuselage. The parallel development of two different wing configurations is quite common in the Soviet Union and both designs were taken to the prototype stage during 1966, roughly six years after the swing wing project was first discussed in Moscow.

quantities of fuel on takeoff and landing, dramatically reducing the aircraft's range and they could not be used in level flight.

The Mid-23DPP was demonstrated to the public by Poyt Ostapenko on Aviation 29, July 20, at Omodetovo airfield. As a result of this demonstration, the aircraft was assigned the NATO reporting name Failhes.

Both the Mid-23DPP and Mid-23DPP proved to be less than successful and neither aircraft was developed beyond the prototype stage.

## 0.7 MiG-231

The swing wing fighter prototype proved to be quite a demanding undertaking for the MidGOR. While much of the basic research data on swing wings was provided by the MidGOR, a considerable design effort was required to mate this wing to a usable fighter fuselage. This effort was needed up by Rotskiuk legacy.

The swing wings design showed a remarkable similarity to that of the American F-111, but with a marginally smaller wing sweep and one more widely spaced pivot points. The wing had three sweep settings, M-1 degrees, 45 degrees and 71 degrees. The wing control was manual and took approximately fifteen seconds to fully sweep the wing from the forward position to the fully sweep back position. The wing had full span, three segment, trailing edge flaps and overwing spoilers, but no injections. Roll control is accomplished by the tail flying horizontal stabilizes, which can be operated together to control pitch or separately to control. Each side is driven by a large electroordinative power unit.

This type of controlor has some to be known in the West by the term - tailerton.

While the MidG-23DPP been equipped with a small centerful test in similar to that used on the Mid-21 Fished, the MidG-231 had a large ventral fin fin which was imaged to fold to standard when the landing gear was lowered.

While the MidG-23DPP Feinites had a landing gear adopted from the Mid-231 finished, an entirely new design was introduced on the MidG-231. In the lowered position, the main landing gear is reagued in the windset on trailing arms that keep the wheel in the vertical. The legs are pivoted at the innermost, close to the centerline of the aircraft. Upon retraction the main leg is pulled straight up and slightly to the rear by the vertical retraction jack. The trailing arm folds downward and forward until weished is stowed almost horizontal in the wheel well located in the underscale of the fuselage. The well is closed over by doors on the top and bottom of the well and on the great jego. One of the landing gear well doors also doubles a debris guard which covers the main gear wheel when the gear is down.

The MidG-231 was powered by 22.04681.5 Turkula LaM-7F study engine mounted in the rear of the semi-monocating fuselage. The fuselage has a direct cross section, flattened along the occipital sides in front of the air intakes. The vertical movable ramp air intakes on the MidG-231 prototype were similar to those used on the McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom. To admit extra airflow for the engine at low speeds, a pair of rectangular blow-in auxiliary doors are provided on each inlet under the wing glove.

The MidG-231 prototype (1 stands for variable) box for the first time during April of 1967. Together with the MidG-23DPP prototype, its demonstrated for the first time on Aviation Day at Domodelovo, being flow by Aleksand Fedotov. NATO assigned the reporting name Flugger to the prototype, although at the time NATO officials had no indication of the aircraft's barley or actual Soviet designation.

The first MidG-231 prototype carried the tactical number Blue 231 on the nose and was followed by at least nine other prototypes. The first and third prototypes are on permanent esbibuit in the Air Force Museum at Monino, near Moscow.

Tilats with both prototypes clearly showed the advantages of the swing wing fighter over the tilt engine prototype. The MidG-23DPP project was cancelled, while the Sovites ordered the MidG-231 into production during 1969, initially with an order for a number of pre-production aircraft to equip an operational test and evaluation squadron.

The Pogoger A prototype makes a slow pass over Romanuskey during its flight test program, A total of 1967 and was tested at Romanuskey alongside the Fathless prototype, is now on display at the Air Force Museum at Monino.

MiG-23S/SM FLOGGER A

During 1996, the Soviet Air Force ordered a small production batch of some 100 MG-231 aircraft under the service designation MG-23S, allocating the aircraft to an evaluation unit for service testing under operational conditions. Soviet pilots quickly found that the MG-23S was far different than the delta unsigned MGG-21 Fishbies they had been flying. The MG-23S had twice the engine thrust of the MGG-21, twice the internal fuel and more than twice the gross weight.

As it became apparent in the West that the swing wing MG-23 fighter had entered production and was being produced in quantity, NATO assigned the reporting name 'logger A to these early production variants.

The MG-23S differed from the MG-231 in a number of ways. While the prototypes carried to be weapons or radar, the MG-23S was fully equipped for combat missions. An 5-21 Sapuli Air event radar (called Jay Bird by NATO) was installed in the nose giving the Pigger A limited at weather capability. Internalaran consisted of a GSN-231. Burst named 234 carbon mounted in a semi-processed housing on the fuselage centerline. The weapon was installed in such a manner that the entire unwing housing could be lowered from the fuselage by means of an internal win, which greatly used maintenance and rearing. The amount weighted 114 pounds and had a rate of 07.340 pounds per minute. To achieve this high rate off, the cannou utilizes the Gast principle (originally developed in Germany during 1916) in which the recoil of one can automatically loads and fires the second canno. The GSN-23L has proven to be a very reliable weapon.

Exterhand the MG-23S carries four ordinance pylons, two under the fuselage and one under each wing, Morse profus could be fitted with shuncher losses for air-to-air missiles with with whos/rocket pods. The standard air-to-air missile carried by the MG-23S was the K-13A-(AA2) Mild. This weapon was a Soviet copy of the American M-MIMO-based Weather. Early K-13S were rather unreliable and followed anything - but the intended target. The AA2-AA2 had less then progressively improved over the years and is now regarded as a reliable air-to-air missile. At door stapped antenna was installed on the astrboard using nylon.

In addition to the ordinance pylons, a centerline fuselage plyon was fitted to the MG-23S which was used to carry a 176 gallo standard fetal tank.

The MG-23S anticoutions in an SP-50-1S system, with the antenna mounted on the underside one as used the radome, a three probe SGR-21F system (called Qdd Robs by NATO) installed on the nose as used at the head of the headway and A VHF blade antenna for the RSIL-5 radio on the dorsal spine behind the canopy. To improve the lipid's rear view, an electrically heated rear view mirror was installed in the upper canopy.

While neither the MG-23UPDO or MG-23I prototypes were equipped with speed brakes, the MG-23S had run and speed brakes installed on the tail just ahead of the engine exhaust. The horse were mounted above and below the horizontal stabilizer and when viewed from the front, formed as N when deployed.

The MG-23S was followed into service by an improved variant, the MG-23SM (M stands for modified). The changes between the MG-23S and MG-23SM were mainly internal and resulted from requirements dictated by the operational setting of the MG-23S. The first MG-23S were delivered during late 1969 and, although the MG-23SM was a sound design, a decision had been reached to replace the Lquisa engine with a tighter, more powerful, and more fed efficient Transuards R-27 turbooid. As result, production of the MG-23S/SM was held to a very limited number.

As soon as the Transuards powered variants became available, the MG-23S/SMs were withdrawn from service. These aircraft were not exported and, in fact, were never used outside the Soviet Union. The very short operational life of the MG-23SM was not because of any technical shortcomings in the basic design, it was simply because a better powerplant had become available to replace the heavy and "whirsty" Lyukla engine.

This preseaved Pogger is one of the early Lyukla powered MG-23S Proger As. The aircraft was required for this display and carries a non-standard camoutage scheme and national insights.

## 4 MiG-23ms Floogger E

While the MiG-23S/SMs were being introduced into service, the MiG OR was working on re-engining the MiG-23 airframe with the 2.248S host Tumanskiy & Z-3700 turbobi. This engine had been developed by Sergei Konstantinovich Tumanski and his staff some eight years after the Lyukka AL-7F-1 engine and therefore benefited from newer engine technology.

The R-27-300 was one foot shorter and slightly lighter than the AL-7F-1, was much more efficient and was much more responsive to the throttle, going from idle to full afterburn in 4.5 seconds. It also did not emit the smoke trail that was common to the Jevlka engine. Unlike most western nations, the Soviet Union had elected to stay with the turbojet for its new generation of fighter aircraft, while most western aircraft were being powered by turbogen engines. Turbogen engines had several major drawbacks as far as the Svoets were concerned; they required more concrete materials in manufacture, more sophisticated engine cooling system and had far greater maintenance demands.

The first trials with the Tumansky powered soft-23 began during 1969, three years after the MiG-23I prototype had made its first flight. Given the designation MiG-23MS, the aircraft also underwent a number of aerodynamic changes brought about by the installation of the new engine. While the overall length of the aircraft was on changed, the horizontal stabilizers were relocated some foot foot to the rear and the engine afterburner nozzle was shortened. This gave the MiG-23MS increased maneuverability by a reduction in the aircraft's natural stability and an increase in control authority.

Retaining the original overall span, the wing was modified by a 20 percent increase in school at the root and dip of the movable wing panel. The extended portion of the wing panel terminated in what might be described as a "claw" immediately outward of the fixed wing. This gave wing a dogtooth at the intermediate sweep angle.

These changes had a number of beneficial effects. The forward movement of the aerodynamic center combined with the rear movement of the tail surfaces served to increase overall control effectiveness and maneuverability. Increased upper of the pivoting wing panels reduced the aerodynamic shift that occurred with changes in the wing sweep. The wing dogtooth created a powerful work which re-engesize the airflow at high angles of attack and maintained maximum spoiler effectiveness, again increasing maneuverability.

The radome on the MiG-23MS differed from the MiG-23S/SM in being shorter and wider, although it still housed a Jay Bird radar. A blister, housing a Doppler navigation antenna, was added to the spot the nose, the IL antenna was repositioned slightly forward on the undersider of the nose and a yawne was was added to the top of the nose just to the rear of the radome. The VHF radio antenna mast was also repositioned, being moved rearward on the fuselage spine.

The air intake was redesigned, being deeper and having a more angled opening. A single air pressure probe was added to the lower portion of the poristic air intake, while no view represents were added at the same position on the starboard side. These probes served as pressure sensors for the automatic air intake control system.

The MGG-23MS featured a KM-1 ejection seat. This seat can be used at speeds up to 745 mph and at altitudes up to 75,000 feet. It first is rated as a zero-zero seat, although on the northcar that must have a forward speed of at least 80 mph before a ejection can be successfully initiated. The seat includes a KP-2MM oxygen system and a NAZ-7 emergency survival kit. The KM-1 seat is the standard ejection seat used for all Fogster variants and is also used on a number of other MiG flights including the MiG-2SFox-bat. The KM-1 seat is widely disliked by MiG-23 pilots because of its tendency to cause back injuries during ejection. Whenever possible, MiG-23 pilots will crash land rather than eject.

The rear fuselage air brakes were changed, being enlarged and strengthened with two external metal reinforcement bars. The external reinforcement allowed the speed brakes to be employed at higher speeds.

Flight tests of the Tunnaxly powered MiG-23MS were quite favorable and the advantages of the R-27-200 powerplant along with the aerodynamic refinements of the MiG-23 airframe convinced the Sovits to order the type into production, with the examples becoming operational during 1971.

The MiG-23MS, however, was viewed by the Sovits as an interim interceptor/fighter and the number assigned to Soviet fighter regimens was fairly small. While the MiG-23MS was entering service, the MiG Gok was already working on a variant with more sophisticated electronics and an greatly improved radar system. The few MiG-23MS fighters that actually entered Soviet service had a brief effort and Soviet squadrons that operated by three were never deployed on the Soviet Union.

A number of these early MiG-23MS Floggers Es were exported to Algoria, Egypt, Alpha, Iraq and Syria. It must be noted that the Fugger wasserted to the countries in the Middle East losing before any of the countries in the WARSAW Pact were equipped with the MiG-23MS. The first NTG-23MS fighters that are exported with the MiG-23MS. The first NTG-23MS fighters that are exported with the MiG-23MS.

Although the MiG-23MS was developed before later MiG-23 fighter variants, it can be as NATO reporting mansifies later than the aircraft that followed it into service.

This was because MiG did not become aware of the aircraft until after it had gifted the follow-on variants in Soviet service. Thus, when the MiG-23MS was first sighted in Italy during 574. It was assumed to be a newarian and assigned the NATO reporting mans Trigger E. In fact, NATO (and others) assumed the aircraft was a dedicated export variant of the later Fiugger fighter variants and on the older aircraft.

One reason for this mix-up was that the MiG-23MS was carried out by the Bayt Air radar. The Bayt had a search range of 118 males and a tracking range of 12 males. During nearly 1970s, the Sovits did not respond to their new technology radars and found the early MiG-23MS with the Lay Bird to be perfect for export to their Middle East residents. Additionally, the Bayt required MiG-23MS could easily be absorbed by the receiver.

In this paper, the Bayt equipment MG-23MS could easily be absorbed by the receiver.

In this paper, the MiG-23MS was carried out by the Bekana Air Forcedriver the GiG-23MS into combat against Israeli F-16W over the BetaXa Valley, in Lebanon. Within a week, the Srirans had lost either eight aircraft at least thirty-six Floggers while the ID/AF lost two aircraft.

the mid-1980s it had become the Soviet's standard short ranged air-to-air missile. To increase the fire power of the MIG-23M (and other platforms that carry AA-8s) the Sovitse have developed a dual missile launched rail capable of carrying two AA-8s and being mounted on any standard python that was capable of handling single AA-8s launcher ralls.

The MIG-23M can also be used in a secondary ground attack role. For the air-to-ground mission the MIG-23M can be armed with U1-B-14 out and U8-2 rocket clocks. As special four bombards designed for carrying four FAS 100-botsman also be carried on the wing and tasking pisons. In addition a wide variety of standard Soviet bombs can be carried.

By the end of 1974, MIG-23M production had reached and exceeded four aircraft per week and over the next two years this area more than double. Eventually, MIG-23M production reached a point where some four hundred aircraft were being built annually.

The MIG-23M was first observed by the West when the aircraft was deployed to the German Democratic Republic as part of the Soviet Air Forces assigned to the Group of Soviet Forces in Germany (GSFG) during 1973 and NATO issued the aircraft the European Engine of Ripe. The MIG-23F project quickly became the most numerically important aircraft in the inventory of the GSFG. Regiments of some forty-five Progress each are based at the following GSFG bases; Finow, Damgarten, Kohn, Juterborg, Zerlst, Mersburg, and Falkenberg.

During 1978, the Sovitse's began equipping WARSAW Pact countries with the Flugger B under the export designation MIG-23MF. The first country to receive the Flugger B was Bulgaria, followed shortly by East Germany and Czechosiovakia. Bulgaria operates

Mig-23ML FLOGGER G

During the early 1980s, the MIG OXR began a project to update the MIG-23M _Flogger_ Byth enhanced avionics and other improvements under the designation MIG-23ML. The first example of this new PGugger were observed by the West at Risalish Air Base in Finland during a goodwill by us by six aircraft detachment under the command of TICOL 6. Belenweiler. The Society visited the Finnish M6-21 Fishbelt fighter at Risalish between 1 and 4 August 1978, giving western intelligence agencies their first good look at this new PGugger variant, which was assigned the NATO reporting name Flogger G. Later than same year the same six MIG-23MLs visited the French Air Force Normali-Niemen fighter unit at Rhesus. This French unit had been formed in the Soviet Union during the Second World War and over the years a tradition for exchange lists between both countries was maintained. Later, Mringe F-1 of the Norunda-Niemen visited the Soviet Union. Finally, these an MIG-23ML visited Sweden during mid-August of 1981. In all three visits, it was apparent that the Soviet pilots and ground crews had been thoroughly brief for their exposure to the West. The MIG-23MLs used for these visits were not standard Soviet front line aircraft and lacked several general pieces of equipment, such as sweeps pylon, IR detectors and some cocktail instrumentation. In addition, these six aircraft were all from a very end production block and had been specially prepared for trips to non-WARSAW part countries. The standard MIG-23ML Fogger G differs from the earlier MIG-23M Fogger B in a number of ways. The most obvious difference is the reduced size of the dorsal fin in front of the vertical stabilizer. The small air intake found on the starboard side of the vertical stabilizer was deleted and the fuel line/electronic cable out on the lower rear leakage was also deleted. Two small blisters were added to the rear fuselage just above the ventral fin (one on each side), replacing the singe squared blister that was carried in front of the speed brake on the starboard side of the MIG-23M. These blisters house the lower hemisphere antennas of the Reger N electronic warfare system. The ventral fin was also modified with a small leading edge extension being added to the base of the fin and a small dielectric panel being added to the rear portion of the fla. The

The nose area of the MIG-23ML Fogger G was also modified. The nose wheel was strengthened with much larger torque sensors links being installed on the forward side of the nose wheel leg and larger letting based. The shape of the TP-23 IR detector housing was changed and the LIS antenna was moved from the port to the starboard side of the nose. A nose hadende antenna was fitted to the underside of the nose on the port side of the IR detector housing. The small avionics bay air intake was also repositioned, being moved lower on the fuselage slicing. Instead of a single angle of attack transmitter (located on the port side of the MIG-23M) the Fogger G was fitted with an angle of attack transmitter on both sides of the nose, somewhat lower than on the MIG-23ML. The SRO-23ML odd Roels FF antenna array was located further broken on the nose, closer to the windscreen. The small air terminus were probe fitted to the nose of the MIG-23M Fogger B target. In front of the windscreen, we found that in front of the windscreen was deleted on the MIG-23ML (except for the six demonstration aircraft). The positioning of the air leaves sensor tubes on the lower portion of the air intakes was reversed on the MIG-23ML; that is, instead of two sensors on the starboard side and one on the port side, (MIG-23M) two new corner corner on the port side and one on the starboard side. On both sides of the air intake ranks vary in size, with the starboard light mounted on the underside of the air intake ranks vary in size, with the starboard light being larger than the north light. Both the MIG-23MS (Flogger E) and MIG-23M (Flogger B) had internal strong points and external mounting points for a weapons pylon on the underside of each air intake duct. In the event, the pylons were rarely, if ever, used and the internal provision for these pylons was deleted on the MIG-23ML Fogger G. The MIG-23ML Fogger G was first unveiled to the West when a detachment from Kubitsa Air Base visited Blesa Air Base in Finland, during early August of 1978. The external ticket the In detector under the nose and carried to external pylons, except the centering python. MIG-23MLs begun to replace the earlier MIG-23M in Soviet Regments during the early 1980s. By the mid-1980s, most frontline patients in the Soviet Union and Soviet regiments based in WARSAW Pact countries were re-equipped with Flogger Gs. As they were replaced, the MIG-23M Fogger Bs were either exported, used as transfers or held in reserve. While most MIG-23MMs had been delivered in an overall air superiority Gray camouflage of the MIG-23MMFogger Gs as delivered from the factory in a tactical camouflage scheme. The undersurfaces are painted in a Sky Blue, while the upwardfaces are painted in three standard colors, although there is no standard pattern. Soviet requirements for camouflage simply state that 'the upper surfaces should be effectively camouflaged.' The photos used on most Soviet flighters are Dark and Light Vibne Green, Light Brown and Earth Brown, although colors may vary on exported air.

## Floggers in Afghanistan

During August of 1986, the Soviets deployed a regiment of forty-five MG2-3ML Flower Gs to Afghanistan. These aircraft were soon in combat flying initially from Kabul and later from Bagram Air Base, While the MG6-3MM. Fleager G is primarily an air-to-air fighter/interceptor, the Flogger Gs deployed to Afghanistan were used almost exclusively in the air-to-ground role. It is believed that this deployment was undertaken as an operational test and evaluation to determine the capabilities of the Flogger G in its secondary role of ground attack under actual combat conditions.

The Floggers deployed to Afghanistan soon began to carry some unusual markings. To mark successful bombing missions, a number of the aircraft were painted with White stars under the cockjet. Each star represented one sortie and these missions markings represented the total flow by a particular aircraft, not necessarily the pilot that flew it.

One Of the Squadron Commanders of the Flogger regime was MM Anatolyan Siroba usually Jess a Flogger G with the actual number Willing 8-3 and twenty-seven mission stars are the cockjet. Another well known pilot was COL Anatolyan Levenshko, who he took a total of 188 million sessions. T147 which were ground attack sortic. COL Lovenko blews last mission 27 December 1986. This mission was his mid of the day and was a bombing mission Aquidiabeli anti-arircraft artillery positions along the Satalog road. His formation of Floggers would hit the enemy aircraft positions near the city of Chairman on the Saling Pass road, while other aircraft supplies one airport to Soviet ground forces in the area.

Knowing that his aircraft was fully crippled and would soon go out of control, COL Levchoso the flogger in the one army anti-arircraft positions. He did not get clear and for his actions on this mission, COL Levchenko was presented with one of the Soviet Union's highest awards, Herb of the Soviet Union.

## 11 Mig-23 FLOGER K

The latest fighter variant of the Flogger was first revealed to the West during 1986 when a US Navy F-4 Phantom crew observed a Flogger of the Vietnamese coast which featured a number of changes over earlier Flogger fibrites. This sighting led NATO to assign this new Flogger variant the reporting name Flogger K. At this time, the Soviet designation for the Flogger K is unknown. While a number of carrier publications have identified this variant as either the MIG-23ML or MIG-23bis, both of these designations are now known to be incorrect.

The Flogger K differs from all earlier Flogger variants by having swiveling stores pylons mounted under the outer wing panels. Prior to the Flogger K, the only outer wing pylons used on the Flogger had been forced splots. Fuel tanks were normally carried on these pylons and in the event of combat, the tanks had to be petitiused before the wing could be fully swept back. The newswiveling pylons are similar in function to those used on the General Dynamics F-11 and Panavia Torondo. It is known that the pylon can carry drop tanks and it is believed that it is wired to carry R-23 or later air-to-air missiles.

Another feature of the Flogger K was the introduction of a dogtooth notch in the inboard leading edge of the wing glove. This dogtooth notch penetrates vortices over the rear fuselage area which improve the aircraft's stability in any at high angles of attack and compensates for the loss of side area caused by the reduction of the dorsal fin area.

The standard three pole Odd Rots IFF antenna, which was used on all earlier variants of the Flogger (as well as many other Soviet latectical aircraft) was replaced by a stable IFF antenna (1986 onwards. Internally the MIG-23 Flogger K carries improved avionics including a lighter version of the High Lark radar. Most late produce-motion MG-23 Flogger Ks have had the spray/debris guard removed from the nose wheel.

Other improvements have come in arrangement. In addition to the same variety of air-to-air swaps available to earlier variants, the Flogger K can carry newer air-to-air missiles such as the A-11 Archer short range AAM and A-10 Alamo (successor to the R-23-A7-A7-pexels).

To date, no Flogger Ks have been exported outside the Soviet Union. A number of Soviet Air Force Flogger Ks were developed to the German Democratic Republic as part of the Group of Soviet Forests in Germany. During 1984, the Soviet Union deployed a squadron of fourteen MIG-23 Flogger Ks to Cam Rank Bay in Vietnam. These aircraft were deployed to provide air-edge coverage for the late Brazil was being used by an increasingly large number of Soviet aircraft and ships. Additionally, these fighters were tasked to provide export services for the Tu 16 Badgers and Tu 98 years which were also stationed at C Cam Rank Bay Marine 1989. During the 1989, the Sousets began to scale back this force and currently it is believed that there are only ten To 16 and MIG-23 remaining at the base. One interesting highlight concerning the Flogger satinot at C Cam Rank Bay is the fact that they are the only Soviet Flogger unit to be identified with a unit marking. These aircraft carry a Black and White figure of a standing Dolphin on the rudder. In the Far East, a number of MIG-23 Flogger Ks were deployed to Erorto Island. These islands are part of the Japanese Northern Territories which were occupied by the Red Army during the closing days of the Second World War. These islands are regarded by the Japanese to be part of their homeland and therefore illegally occupied. The Soviet Union has historically maintained a strong force on the island and has refused all efforts aimed at negotiating its return to Japan.

## 5 Mig-27 FLOGGER D

During the early 1970s the MidG OKB began work on a dedicated ground attack variant of the MidG-23MS fighter. To speed development, the airframe, wing, engine, and landing gear of the MidG-23 was retained for use in the attack variant. The swing with would allow the aircraft to use short runways while carrying a heavy weapons load. The combination of small size, a more efficient swing, greater power, less fuel consumption and greater weapons loads than the S-U7 (just entering service) greatly impressed Soviet defense authorities and the MidG OKB was ordered to build a prototype of their proposed ground attack aircraft under the designation MidG-27.

The MidG OKB, under the leadership of Rostistiskyakov, set about producing a prototype ground attack fighter which, although based on the MidG-23MS Flogger E, would be better suited to the new mission. A ground attack aircraft requires good all around visibility, while a high altitude capability and supersonic top speed are not as important as with an interceptor.

To improve the pilot visibility forward and downward, the nose was completely redesigned becoming much shorter and wedge shaped. The new nose sloped sharply down from the cockpit to pointed out. To further improve pilot visibility, theonomy was designed with greater depth and the upper longitudinal frame (common on the MidG-23 fighter variants) was deleted. The wind screen assembly was made much deeper and sloped downward at a sharper angle than the wind screen of the fighter variants. In addition, it was restressed to withstand a bird strike and small arms free. Because of the appearance of the new nose section, the MidG-27 quickly earned the nichichave _Ukans_ (Duck nose).

The High Lark radar found in the interceptor variants was replaced by a laser range finder marked target excre mounted in the extreme forward portion of the nose. A giant avoidance radar and a Type N-50dB Doppler navigation radar are also carried in the nose along with a Type N-50dB on R-5V-dB alone. Unlike the interceptor/ fighter variants, the MidG-27 carries the Type SP-50-1S antenna on the centerline of the nose below the glass viewing point of the laser range finder.

While the MidG-23 fighter carries a single Doppler radar blister on the port side of the nose in the nose when no of the other box door, the MidG-27 is equipped with laterally mounted antennas on both the port and starboard side of the nose as well as a ventral Doppler antenna on the underside of the nose.

The Odd Rods IF antenna and the yaw waves are carried below the nose and the two air data probes for the intake control system are now carried on the upper nose near the porstole of the embryo. Two large external arm plates have been added to either side of the fuselage under the cockpit to protect the pilot from small arms fire.

The nose wheel was strengthened and larger two pressure tires have been fitted to allow the aircraft to operate from forward airfields. To allow the extra space needed for the new tires in the wheel well, the nose wheel doors were bulded. The air data probe mast was located on the starboard side of the nose.

Since a ground attack aircraft is intended to operate at lower altitude than an interceptor, the engine installation on the MidG-27 was redesigned to give the aircraft better performance at lowelsels. The air intake spliter plates were made much smaller and are simpler than those found on the MidG-23 injector. These intakes are fixed and are not the variable geometry boundary layer type found on the MidG-23M Flogger B. The air intake itself is also slightly larger and somewhat bulged when viewed from the front. The The Tamansky R-29N used in the interceptor variants was replaced by a R-29-00tur-bojet engine with a simpler afterburner and nozzle. This engine has a slightly reduced thrustrating in full afterburner; however, its dry thrust ratings is almost unchanged from the R-29B. By use of this simpler engine/nozzle configuration, both the installed engine weight and flat consumption in subsonic cruise were drastically reduced.

The fuselage weapons pylons found on the MidG-23 fighter were replaced by weapons pylons fitted under the air intake ducts to allow the aircraft to carry larger diameter stores. Additionally, two rear fuselage weapons pylons were added, mounted on the fuselage sides behind the main landing gear walls. These pylons are stressed for weights up to at least 1,000 pounds. The S-U24-Cannon carried on the fuselage centerline of the fighter variants was replaced by a 300M Gh Gh-8-30 Gaiting type as barrel manon. This pin was installed in front of the fuselage centering pylon and is almost entirely external. While this type of mounting has a high cost in increased drag, it eliminates the problem of possible explosions caused by a gun gas build-up, which had been experienced within internally mounted weapons. The pins is fed with rounds carried in an ammonium box stored internally in the fuselage and it is believed that the magazine has a capacity of at least seven hundred rounds.

A missile control data link antenna was fitted to the starboard wing leading edge above the wing pylon and a TV camera was mounted above the weapons pylon on the port wing. The missile control antenna is associated with air-to-surface missiles such as the AS-7 Kerry and AS-9 anti-radiation missiles.

Apart from the shorter engine afterburner nozzle, the tail was virtually identical with that of the MidG-23MS Flogger E with the exception of the small air intake on the starboard side of the vertical stabilizer, which was deleted. Early production MidG-27's lacked trim labs on the horizontal stabilizers; however, these were fitted on late production aircraft.

The MidG-27 prototype flow for the first time during 1972 and after successfully completing its evaluation trials, the type was put into production. A number of early production aircraft were deployed to the Group of Soviet Forces in Germany, where the aircraft was first spotted by the West. NATO gave the new ground attack variant the reporting Europe T. The S-U5G operates the trigger Programme for the strength of thirty aircraft each based at Mirow, Altenburg and Finsterwalde in East Germany.

In October of 1988, the Soviet Union deployed approximately thirty MG-27 Flogger Ds to Afghanistan for offensive operations against Afghan freedom fighters. These aircraft were based at Shindman AFB in the western part of Afghanistan and flew their first combat mission on 31 October, attacking generrill positions south of Kandahar, the country's second largest city. The MG-27s remained in combat until 15 February 1989, when all Soviet forces withdrew from Afghanistan.

There were very little external changes on the MGG-27 Flogger D during its production run; however, recently the Sovies have begun to remove the missile control radar antenna and TV camera pods from the wing glove leading edges and the debris guard from the nose wheel.

The MGG-27 Flogger D has seen widespread service with the Soviet Air Force and still equips a considerable number of frontline regiments: The MGG-27 Flogger D, however, was never exported outside the Soviet Union.

This late production MO-27 Flogger D carries a R-60 (AA-8) Applied missile launched rail on the wing glove glove glove. The mistake control antenna pod, normally carried on the wing glove leading edge was deleted on this production MO-27 Flogger D.

## 6 Mig-23b/BN FLOGGER F/H

The Sovites developed a second ground attack variant of the Mid-23 in an effort to simplify the procurement of spare parts and to produce an export variant that would be compatible with the interceptor/fighter variants already offered for export. This aircraft had the nose section of the Mid-27 mated with the airframe of the Mid-23MS Fugger E.

Development of this hybrid ground attack inertial began during the early 1970s and the first experimental prototype was found during 1973. After successful evaluation, the type entered production that same year. Aircraft built for service with the Soviet Air Force received the designation Mid-23B, while those built for export were designated as Mid-23BNs.

The Mid-23B/BN differs from the Mid-27 in a number of ways. The most obvious difference is in the engine air intakes. The Mid-23BN is equipped with the variable geometry boundary layer intakes used on the fighter variants of the Mid-23, although the pressure sensors found on the intakes of fighter variants have been relocated to the spot of the cockley on top of the cockley on.

To afford a larger degree of compatibility with the fighter variants, the six barrel 30mm GSh-8-h-30 can reason by relaxed with the GSh-23, twin barrel 23MM cannot.

The Mid-23B-23BNs uses the same Tunnards R-23-00powerplant as the Mid-27-Flogger D along with the bottom afterburn nozzle. With the variable geometry air intakes, the Mid-23BN has a somewhat better performance than the Mid-27 at high speeds, giving the aircraft a secondary air defense capability. The lack of an air interferometer radar, however, makes the Mid-23BN incapable of carrying good visual storage radar guided at-to-air missiles, such as the R-23(A-7) Aqr. Mid-23B/BN can carry infrared missiles, such as the K-13(A-2) Aql. Both-6(A-8)Aphal, and A-11(A)cher.

The Mid-23B/BN has the missiles control produced from the wing leading edge to a position just in front of the starboard wing glove plan. As with the Mid-27, the Mid-23B/BN has two boreldks mounted on the rear fuselage to the rear of the main wheel. This Mid-23B/BN can carry the same weapons load and armament as the earlier Flogger D, although the weapons sprays are relocated from the airlike ducto the underside of the fuselage. Guided autonomous network including the X-8-Yerry, AS-10 Karen and AS-14 Kedge air-to-surface missiles (when the AS-14 is carried, a laser guidance pod is normally fitted to the centerline option). A large variety of unguided weapons can be red by the Mid-23B/BN including UQ-16 and UQ-32 rocket beds (16/6 23bn SatDMS-5 unguided rocked) and various bonus. The rocket pads are beginning to be replaced by a large twenty spot and containing 300 unguided hollow charge rockets. Single S-240 rockets can also be carried.

Free full weapons include FAB 100 and FAB 500 bombs, PTX 250 cluster dispersers, RPK-100 fragmentation bombs, BETA B-25 concrete pierc bombs and a 500 kg(1,100) bound layer sealed bomb. There are two different types of gun pods carried, a UPK-23 win 23MM gun pod and a single barrel 23MM gun pod as a higher 23MMFuel/Air Explosive (FAE) weapon, which resembles a large drop tank and was used in Afghanistan with devastating effects. FAE weapons are used primarily to attack large area targets such as strong concentrations, airfields and villages. The weapons has a lethal radius of up to 1,300 feet and produces a huge fire ball, FAE weapons kill by fire, burning of the oxygen in the air, and from the tremendous over-pressure caused by the blast. The M6-23B sweeps in large numbers with Soviet Frontal Aviation Regments, while the export M6-23BN has seen considerable export success. The first export aircraft were supplied to Middle Eastern nations. Egypt received a number of M6-23BNs, basing them at Mersa Martin). As the political climate between the Soviet Union and Egypt changed and the Soviet s cut off spare parts for the Froggers, the aircraft were put in storage. Reportedly, most were later sold to the USAF, while several others were paresed to China. Other Middle East operators of the M6-23BN are Algeria, Libya, Syria and Iraq.

When these exported M6-23BNs were first observed by the West, NATO assigned to the aircraft the reporting marine Engineer F. It is not known ITVV intelligence specialists missed the lateral antennas mounted on the port and stardboard sides of the fuselage above the wheel wheel door, or if they were not carried on early M6-23BNs. When these antennas were detected, NATO assigned aircraft with the antennas the reporting name Fugger H, to distinguish these M6-23BNs from those without the antennas (it is believed that there were, in fact, no M6-23BNs produced without the lateral antennas).

Besides the Middle East, M6-23BNs are flown by Cuba, Ethiopia, Angola and recently there have been reports that Sudan has received an unspecified number of Froggers from an unidentified source.

India operates both the M6-27 Flogger J and M6-23BN Floigger H. The first aircraft received wire M6-23BNs, one delivered assembled directly from the Soviet Union, which other were received as knocked down kits. Assembly of these by Hindustan Aeronatics Ltd. at Nask began during 1984 with the first operational M6-23BN unit, No 10 Winger Dagger Squadron, being declared combat ready during 1985.

Three WARSAP Pact countries operate M6-23BNs, Bulgaria, Czechsoulakia and Estal Germany. The first country to obtain the M6-23BN was Czechsoulakia during 1997, followed by East Germany during 1981. Currently, the Czech Air Force has an inventory of 30-140 Floigger His organized into three flights based at Becphire, Hradeco and Pavrido Share was of Prago, and another flight based at Namseli and Malomou. This regiment is under the operational control of the 10th Tactical Air Amy. The German Democratic Republic sponsors some thirty M6-23BNs assigned to _Joghomb

## MiG-27m FLOGGER J

During the late 1960s, the MIGO OKB developed an improved variant of the MIG-27 Fugger D under the designation MIG-27. The basic Fugger D airframe was retained and the aircraft was outfitted with new and improved avoidings.

The MIG-27M was first identified by NATO during 1981 and assigned the NATO reporting name Fugger J. The nose of the MIG-27M differed from the MIG-27 in a number of ways. Achin bister, housing a Laser Target Designer System (LTDS) was added to the nose, the LLS antenna was relocated from the centerline of the nose to the port side, the Odd Rods IFF antenna carried below the nose was replaced by a blade type IFF antenna and the single angle of attack transmitter carried on the port side of the MIG-27 was replaced by no wake slip of the nose.

The LTDS detects laser energy from an illuminated target and feeds range and bearing information directly into the onboard fire control computer. The computer then automatically releases the suspension selected by the pilot, firing weapons at the proper distance from the target to ensure a hit.

The MIG-27M also featured a change to the gun mounting. Small fins were added to the side of their lower fuseling line with the gun nozzle to reduce gun ingestion by the engine. The rear portion of the gun itself was covered by a fairing to protect the gun operating gear from object damage.

As with late production MIG-27 Fugger Ds, the missile control pad and television camera pod on the wing glove leading edges were deleted. The wing glove area was modified with the addition of a leading edge extension (LEX) to improve low speed/high angle of attack performance.

The Indian government selected the MIG-27 to meet its strike fighter/fighter-bomber requirement and obtained a license to produce the aircraft in India. Builtly Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd.(HAL) wasi, India, the MIG-27 will be the MIG-29N Fugger H on HAL production lines (both the MIG-29N and MIG-27M are known as the _Badharu_ Valiant In Indian Air Force), The first MIG-27M, assembled from major subassemblies built in the Soviet Union, was completed on 11 January 1986. During the next phase of production HAL assembled aircraft from component kits provided by the Soviets. During 1988, HAL began fabrication of detail parts from raw materials and began total manufacturing of the aircraft. The Tomslavsky R-29-300 report specialist as built under license at the HAL plant at Korapath, while the aircraft's instruments are builtly HAL's Avonics Division at Hyderabad. The Indians plan to build approximately 165 MG-27Ms.

See \(H\).S.A., Soviet Air Force MoG-27Fugger J, carries an unusual arrangement load, a single FAR 100 bomb on the rear fuselage rack and a UU-16 rocket pod carried on the port fuselage prion. This aircraft also has the nose wheel spray/debris cover deleted.

## MiG-23UM FLOGER C

As is common Soviet practice, a two seat combat capable trainer variant of the MiG-23 was developed under the designation MiG-23UM. Based on the airframe of the MiG-23MMs (Flogger E), the two aircraft were practically identical with the exception of the second cockpit. The MiG-23UM retains the overall length of the MiG-23M with the instructor's cockpit possible installed in the fishege behind the standard cockpit. The second cockpit is slightly raised to improve the instructor's forward vision, resulting in a heavier seat spine and a slightly humpback appearance.

Each cockpit has a separate capacity which is in general to upward. Neither canopy is fitted with the internal/external rear view mirrors found on the fighter variants of the Fioger. There are new coal gas turbines fitted into the connecting learning between the two cockpit; however, these do nothing to improve the frontal view for the instructor. To give the instructor the necessary forward vision for midfoang and takeoffs, a retrodictable perspective is mounted in the instructor's cowbo with automatically debris when the landing gear is lowered. A folding instrument lying hot so carried in the students' cockpit and when not in use, is used behind the ejection test.

Both cockpit are equipped with KM-1 zero-core ejection seats and the seat in the students cockpit became connected from the rear cockpit. The MiG-23UM content system features a carout system that is activated whenever the instructor takes over control of the aircraft. The cutout automatically disconnects the student's cowboils as the instructor touches this control stick and/or pedder pedder.

Early production MiG-23UM were powered by the Thanksay R-27-300powerplant, although later production aircraft were powered by the R-29.2. Extremely, there is no differences between the early and late production aircraft.

The MiG-23M1 is intended to train both fighter and attack pilots and as a result, the MGG-23UM carries an air-to-ground missile control antenna pool of the standard wing glove PDA. The MGG-23UM is equipped with the Bay lift at intercept radar (used on the Fioger E). The use of the small Bay lift radar was dictated by the fact that the second cockpit was installed in the MiG-23UM by reducing airs from the engine to the nose.

Tousinal the larger flight LAR LAR card would have meant a reduction in internal fuel and a major redesign of the MiG-23UM's nose. This was first to be unnecessary since students could be trained on the flight LAR card instead. In simulation and later in the single seat Pigger B/G/K, The MiG-23UM also lacks the infrared sensor carried under the nose on the figure variants.

The MiG-23UM has a straight leading edge on the ventral fin without the leading edge extension. The redder has a single hinge and early production MIG-23UMs lacked trim this on the horizontal stainless (which were added on later production aircraft).

For weapons training and combat exercises the MGG-23UM carries the under-Stables GN-231, Amazon Azit Gold and A-A8P-abli air-to-air missiles. To train attack pilots, U-B6-I00-32 rocket peds and/or bombs can be carried on the swing glove and fishege pylons.

The first MGG-23UM was discovered by NATO shortly after the MiG-23MF: Flogger B fighter and was assigned the NATO promptanem Flooger. Most early Fogger CS were delivered from the factory painted in an air superiority Gray camandage, although later production aircraft were delivered in a multi-color tactical camandage. Some Soviet Fioger CCs carry either Yellow or Orange tactical number; however, it is also common to outline the tactical number in White on aircraft carrying the tactical camandage. After stationed inside the Soviet Union carry three digit tactical numbers which identify the aircraft as trainers assigned to a training unit.

The MiG-23UM has been exported to all countries which operate fighter and/or ground attack variants of the Fioger. Algeria, Afghanistan, Anapolis, Bulgaria, Cuba, Czechowskaya, Egypt, Ethiopia, German Democratic Republic, Hungary, India, Iraq, North Korea, Libos, Poland, Romania, and Syria all have Fioger CS in the intervening.

It's uncommon for the Fioger C to be used in a combat role; however, on 28 October 1987 an Anglon Air Force Flogger C (How by Cubans) was shot down by UNITA forches. The crew successfully ejected and was captured by UNITA forches. In WASAW Patent countries, MiG-23UMs are assigned to both combat and advramed training units. In Czechowskaya, Fioger CCs are assigned to all fighter and ground attack recipients, as well as the advanced training units at Pervook and Co. In Hungary, a small number of MiG-23UMs are assigned to the MiG-23MF content at Papa, while others were with the training unit of Szolno. While all Hungarian Fioger Bas are in air superiority Gray, the ex-Soviet Air Force Flogger Cs carry an air-to-ground tactical camandage.

The East German Air Force has assigned their MiG-23UMs to _JagRiffogerschroude & Horiuchi Rau_ at Reememunde, _Agolnomofergergheynod & S1 Kenneth Gowold at Indian-Migereinshahahaftegegrouchard Landor Raz at Bothenburg. All East German MGG-23UMs carry Black three digit tactical numbers, denoting them as training aircraft (figure and ground attack aircraft carry Red three digit tactical numbers).
