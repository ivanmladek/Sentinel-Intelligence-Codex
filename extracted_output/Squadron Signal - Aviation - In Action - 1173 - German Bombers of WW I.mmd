## Author's Note

The most important of the Kaiser's strategic bombers are dealt with here. Machines which, in most of the warning nations, were wheering in a new use for the aeroplane only thirteen years after the Wright brothers had made it possible for man to fly. From these crude beginnings have evolved the awesome global bombers of today.

## Introduction

Great Britain was separated from the European land mass by the English Channel, a meager strip of water measuring some 22 miles (35.4 au) wide. That the island nation was a potential target for energy aircraft was made clear when Louis Brierot crossed the Channel by air in 1990 -- a mere six years after the Wright Brothers made their historic flight in 1993. German awareness of the situation was demonstrated only works that the outbreak of war in 1994. Major Wilhelm Steger submitted to the _Oberne Literatursche_ (HL- Le German High Command) plans to mid the South-East of England using aircraft flying from Calais. This was a seemingly simple proposition as it appeared likely that the French born of Calais would soon in lie bands of the rapidly-advising German Army. Progress of the German Army, however, was unexpectedly shielded and the intended bonding force was withdrawn to Menz. Despite the disruption of Major Steger's plant, lower was attached to daylight air at radio 21 and 24 and December 1994, and the London docks were bonded on Christmas Day -- all two long, single _Friedkhahnfer_ PZII bomers. These attacks by single-engine aircraft occurred before the introduction of the mach-farend boring attacks by German higher than air dribelves, which began on the night of 1992 tomuary 1915.

There would be nearly two years of German might nelside before a land-based serpentine radiant of Britain's capital during the morning of 28 November 1991. Pilot Deber Great England Band and Lennant Walther flies enabled about half single-time **L.V.G.** FC (V20.2716) at Makiakiewicz van Ossend, Belgium. Thirteen mission was very out of the most audiences bombing of the war due. The two men are closer to carbon with the intention of bombing the Admiralty building near Buckingham Palace. For some unexplained reason, the flight of the L.V.G. \(\Gamma\)V best measured by British detressing and arrived over London at 1510 s in an altitude of 13,000et (or 1992.0). The two immediately set showing the first of their 22 h (10 x0) high explosive bombs. It is impossible to say whether judgement or lack thereof indicate the bombs fell between the finished loboving area of Brompton Gohn GJ 1375 carried a bomb container under the lower wing center-section, Carbonhip engrose bombs were noted vesterberg. These only aircraft were regarded as giants due to their unwigent of 66, 187, 235 inches (03.3 au). The twin rudeness and close set engines helped improve the unquality looking bomber's single engine performance.

Road and Victoria railway station -- approximately seven miles (11.3 au) from the intended target. From that point, the courages flyers' luck began to run out. Having crossed the town of flashing on the south coast and headed out over the English Channel without interference, their so-fr reliable engine began flying from trouble before finally riding. A forced landing that be to made near Budolger at 1415 hours, Both Brand and Ilges were captured.

This was only the latest in a number of 60 German airships, the first over British territory of flashing on the south coast and headed out of the English Channel without interference.

Robinson was awarded by Victoria Cross. Despite their great range had lead carrying ability, the great airships once feared as the ultimate weapon against with no defense existed was proven to be extremely vulnerable. The hydrogen filled Zepepkin quickly burned when attached by Brighert. During this same period - 1914 through 1961 -- around west will equal to the last of two rising discharge bombing attacks. New methods of carrying out such attacks would have to be found.

Discovering new methods was not difficult; their foundations had already been laid by for **Skiovy in Imperial Russia** with such giant aircraft as the Granitor of 1913 and the Bras **Murnes** in the following year. Nevertheless, the aircraft had to be obtained with the limited performance of aircraft engines of the day.

Britin and hay were not long in following Schoxady's kind: Britain produced the Handley-Pague series of bomsters, for instance in December 1914 with the first prototype flying some twelve months later and becoming operational in March of 1917. In Italy during the same year, the three-engine **Capani C3.3** had become standard. The C.3.3's endurance of some three

A.E.G. G.IV

The A.E.G. G.IV resulted from the development of A.E.G.'s earlier G-type bonnues -- the G.I. G.II, and G.II. A.E.G. (_Allgemeemeeme Elektrikais Gesellschaft_: General Electric Company of Germany) began to show interest in building twin-engine aircraft in 1914. A single example of the A.E.G. G.II entered service via US US US powered by two 100 W/o Mercedes D I entering regime two-blood wood wooding. The construction of the 52 to 230 light/yr. e/l. twin-engine boneils employ followed. The G.II was covered by two 150 light/yr. e/l. twin-engine boneils, which turned out-based worlds. In December 1915, A.E.G. and introduced the G.II, as still larger bonebler equipped with two ns cis/c. lighter, liquid-cooled 220 hr of Mercedes D IV engines. The G.II's energy stored from-fluidized providers to take advantage of the increased frequency. This aircraft was also fine Af.E.G. design equipped with half-anced control surfaces, a feature which beseedeed prior fatigue during long distance flights.

The A.E.G.G.G IV has a similar design concept to all three of its insistence, participants, and quality the G.II. The G.IV had a stringent G.II to-date 150 (18.4), a length of 16.5 m/s. the length of 16 inches (9.7 d), and a height of 12 feet, 9.5 inches (9.9 d), Naturally, the G.IV was built of welded steel tubing (unusual by the sanders of the time), wood fabric. The residue was made as a single unit using steel tubing. The nose was covered with physowatch, while the remainder of the breakage was also forked. The open were spaces consisted of a nose compartment, 1. acobylat, and a rare compartment. The new ducts access all time compartments with ink ink. The G.IV could only up to four Vermembers; however, the nominal current was three. A system for linking the controls provided a second crewment with a limited ability to fly the G.IV in an emergency. The system only operated the header and elevors; it was not connected to the motorously sensitive allepers.

The wings employed two steel tube spans with alternating wooden main and fink ribs. The leading edges were also made of wood, while the trailing edge was formed using heavy gauge wire -- a feature which contributed to the scalloped effect once the wings were covered with shrunken fabric: The tail surfaces were made of welded steel tube and covered with finkic. Although the vertical fan and horizontal stabilizers were given a cambreed (curved) surface, the radder and elevors had a flat surface. Steel tubes traced the vertical fan to the upper fuselage bonegues, while a second pair of steel stouts connected the horizontal stabilizer to the lower fuselage boregues.

The A.E.G.G.IV was powered by a pair of 260 hr six cylinders, liquid-cooled Mercedes D IV engines. The N engines, which were operated using the G.II's 220 W/o Mercedes D IV engines. The six-cylinder finl engines were housed in inches and joined to the lower wing and finkic by soft sturs. Each engine was equipped with its own radiator mounted at the front of the needle. The entire engine nozzle could be completely enclosed; however, the upper panel was usually let off. There were also occasions where the side panels were held off for what is believed to have a weight saving measure. The missing panels seemed to have little, if any, effect on engine or/or aircraft stemming. A unique aspect of the engines was their tractor mounting, with the proprieties mounted forward; most German bonehves of the run used a power configuration with raw-mounted peptides.

The G.IV's main landing gear was completed of two sets of dual wheels mounted beneath the engine nozzle. The landing gear was fairly standard in its design, apart from using weld-of steel tube construction and having steel spring shock absorbers. A steel solider to keep the unit of the ground.

The A.E.G.G.IV's construction employed large amounts of steel, which resulted in an aircraft that was overweight for its size. With a full full food of fact, the G.IV's bowload of some 8800 pounds/s was moved compared to other German bonehves of the era. Light bombs - 258 (11.38) -- seeur carried internally. Two bombars were located on the gear side - **The A.E.G.G.G.** **Ritch front front front** is a **July of 1915, was slightly larger than the entire G.I. and was built in both man and triple test versions. Both A.I versions were powered by 150 fine (gen engines. Some 20.4ns were built, with a number serving in operational units. The **bonbns were carried internally under the ocobylt.**of the all compartment, while a third rack was located beneath the wood flooring between the plicy's cockpit and the ant cockpit. Larger brown rows were carried externally. Up to three 100 hps (45.3 x00) bows were carried under the center fuseding section, while a single 100 hb bomb could be carried under each lower wing, just outward the wingort.

The GIV's defensive manner consisted of two 792mbar Maxim IMG (_loftegkahline Maximum Gevdev_ - air-cooled machine gun) Parabellum machine guns. One weapon was mounted on a 3607 mg mount in the forward compartment, while the other four guns switched into a 4-D moment in the all compartment. The ant compartment was also enclosed and the other to traverse this weapon through a 1807 arc around the rear of the aircraft. Each machine gun was fed by drum images clipped by the weapon's brech. Additional ammonium drums were stored in the gumers' compartments.

In many respects, the A.E.G. GIVs and in outstanding design. At 5280 hps (2395 x 300) energy and 7986 hps (36224.6x 40x) fully loaded, the GIV was converging for its size. Much of this weight problem can be attributed to the extensive use of wheeleded to the helmet's son's suction. The aircraft was also short-ranged and carried a small bomb load for its size. The bomber was less powerful than the larger G' types and was incapable of striking targets in Britain from Belgium. Nevertheless, the GIV design was also to be capable of absorbing one-sided shuttle damage and the engines, mixing matrices (problem) without of the production gear, were reliable and sound, German plots from the GIV pleasant to fly overall, despite its sensitive alarms.

The GIV were mainly used to attack Allied military concentrations behind the front lines. The bonkers were assigned to "Battle Squadators", where they provided both offensive and defensive wide airport and battlefield meridional missions. Attacks were made in both day and night, with the day missions usually being accompanied by a fighter resort. Most of these attacks occurred in France, but there were a number of attacks conducted over location of the animals.

**Operational A.E.G. G.Is carried a regular crew of three - a pilot and two gumers. An unusual feature of these designs was the lack of strauts linking the engines to the upper wing. The heavily armed GIs was used as a low attitude escort fighter before being re-gated to bombing and reconnaissance roles.**

The GIV made a surprise appearance in Macedonia with _Kampfeschunder_ (_KG_: Fighting or Bomber Wing 11 in February of 1917. K1 also drew a single party and longer ranging confine aircraft as well as a number of Friedhishche GIIs at the time.

The Alies' first chance to gain technical knowledge of the A.E.G. GIV can then try GII/125/16/16 was brought down with only minor damage near device-to-Grand. France. Allied pilots reported that the GIV was largely 'clumpy', although the lateral stability was praised. Under the numbering system applied by the Alies to all captured enemy aircraft, 6121/15/16 was allocated at the mild identification code 6.10\({}^{\circ}\). The designation 6.10\({}^{\circ}\) was mistakenly believed by some to be of German origin. There was no such type as an 'A.E.G. GIVs are known to have been operated by the following _Kampfeschunder_ attached to the Amris listed in the given locations: K.1.

Nos. 19 to 21 (18th Army), and Nos. 22 to 24 (2nd Army).

The A.E.G. GIVs was produced until 1917. Some 542 G-type airframes were produced, with the majority being G.IVs. Siemens-Schneider also built the bomber under license. Approximately 50 A.E.G. GIVs were helped to have still been service by the time of the Armstrong on 11 November 1918. Some of these aircraft may have been of the GIVs, a variant with a wing span increased to 78 feet 9 inches (24 M). No. 2A.G.

The G.III's offensive load consisted of up to 3500 hs (1537.6 \(\kappa\)) of bombs. The largest and heaviest bombs were carried on 12 external racks mounted beneath the fatigue and under the inward lower wings. Smaller bombs, weighing up to 22 hs (100 \(\kappa\)) each, could be carried on ten internal racks located within the fatigue center section.

The G.III was soon associated with bombing raids on Paris and the French port city of Dunistrix. The bomber joined rapid popularity among its screws due to its case of handling, reliability, and different remedies. The philosout are able to examine the G.III total total in 16 February 1918, which Allied powder fire bought down an example over France. Allied reports on the slightly-damaged G.III dwell on several interesting features. These features included the mixed construction with plywood covering on the forward headway, the four-wheel main landing gear with its co-spring target hacked, and the smaller wheel under the nose to prevent turning over in a rough landing. The reports also noted the unexpected chord to span ratio of the horizontal stabilizer and the internal bomb bay which augmented the 12 external racks.

The G.III was largely identical to its immediate predecessor the G.III; however, the newer aircraft had shared widepings and revvented to the bibiane it surfaces used on the earlier G.I. The G.III also featured the addition of a 'Gotha Tumer' in the lower air flatselge. The tuned, a Gotha pattered design feature built by Friedrichshafen under license, served to improve the lower gun position's field of frie. G.III bombers were also built by Dumitler and Husa.

The G.IV was introduced in 1918 and resembled the earlier G.IIIa in some areas, particularly the bibiane tail. The G.IV's two Mercedes II VAs engines were mounted in a tractor configuration, instead of the passive layout of previous Friedrichshafen bombers. The nose section was greatly reduced in length from that of the G.IIIa. The shortened zone eliminated the nose gun's position and machine gain, leaving only the single Parhellawn weapon in the rear compartment for defense against primary footprints. With a winning of 74 feet, 2 inches (2.6 \(\mu\)s), and a length of 396 feet, 4 inches (12.8 \(\mu\)s), the G.III was marginally smaller than the G.IIIa. Both the G.IIIa of G.IV were modified to carry a single 2204 h (1000 \(\kappa\)) bomb under the center fudge selection. The increased weight required strengthened funding gear across and pairing of the main wheels. The pairing doubled the main wheels from four to eight, resulting in an increased ground contact area for the underlacing. The increased contact area lowered the bomb's ground pressure on soft fields.

G.IIIs were believed to have accompanied the similar-appearing and better-known Gothas on bombing attacks against Britain. However, definite proof of G.III participation in these racks does not exist. Friedrichshafen G.III bombers were active in attacks on Paris and in operations on the Macedonia Front in the Balkans.

(Above) in keeping with other German bombers, the Friedrichshaaten G.ill featured a pair of 7.82km Parenbuch machine purs for defensive purposes. One weapon was mounted in the nose compartment, while a second was placed in the rear compartment. Occasionally, a third machine purs can extend to fire through a trapdoor in the bottom of the fuselage. This G.ill believed to be the same machine shown in Belgium marking on page 1.

Gotha Bombers

_Gothar Waggwijkijk A.G._ was the best known German bowler manufacturer; the name Gotha was synonymous with nearly all German multi-engine bombers regardless of their actual manufacturer. Although Gotha built over 20 different sites of the multi-engine land and sea-plane designs over the course of Word War are, it is the twin-englined bombler aircraft for which the company was most well known and remembered.

_Gotha's first large G-buser shows the Gotha G.U.H. G.1, which appeared in 1915. The G.1 was unique in having the felaee joined to the upper wing, while the tractor engine and landing gear were placed on the lower wing. The wing and stangle arrangement allowed the two Bear B.H.G1 engines to be placed well without the lower wing close to the aircraft centerline. This engine location improved the bombler's single engine performance and handling. Only a few G-13 cycles were built using 1956, followed by a single sorghum variant -- the Gotha W.D.-- in 1916._

Some 15 G.13s were used in the Balkans until they were withdrawn due to unreliable engines.

_The G.I._ All timed service in August of 1916 and was powered by two Mercedes D7s direct drive engines. Engine power went directly to the proper health without using a felaee to reduce revolvations. Both the G.I. and G.II._ had a version of 77 feet, 9 inches (23.7 s), a length of 38 feet, 8 inches (11.8 s/o), and weighted approximately 7020s (15848 00) fully loaded.

borders, like most of the other German write-engioral bombers, spent much of the time operating at night. Night landings proved to cause a large number of accidents; the new wheels were designed to prevent nose-over landings, much like the single note wheels carried by the Friedrichhufane G.III.

Goda bunder design and production largely ended with the Goda G.V. blower, the company contained to design and produce a small number of large, high speed, twin-engine reconnaissance aircraft: the G.VII, G.VIII, G.VIII, G.IX, and G.X. All the later aircraft were similarly configured in having the slot poses - eliminating the root gap position of carrier Goda bunders-- and having close settings to improve usage engine performance and handling. The G.VII was powered by the standard Metropolis D.V. However, the remainder were powered by 245 W/o Mayb at NY engines. The G.VII and G.VIII employed higher tail assemblies, while the remainder used standard noncomoving talks. Defensive armboard all aircraft was limited to a single 7.920 turbulent branching engine in the dorsal position. Only a few each were built and the G.VII, G.VIII, and G.VIII were the only variants believed to have entered service.

By the autumn of 1916, it became clear to the Germans that the airship attacks on Great Britain were not the other German write-engioral bombers, spent much of the time operating at night. Night landings proved to cause a large number of accidents; the new wheels were designed to prevent nose-over landings, much like the single note wheels carried by the Friedrichhufane G.III.

The Gotha G.V's Mercedes D Via pusur engines were mounted in large bony needles fasted into the upper surface of the lower wing. The needles were covered with light alloy panels. A 220 h (100 x) PW PDR is mounted under the nose.

(Below Right) An alternative to finding down the slot in the upper fuselage was to mount a machine gun on the lower position. The ventral position permitted an increase in detres-sive coverage below and the rear of the monitor.

(Below) Protective the guards were mounted around the att gun's compartment to keep the gunner and his weapon out of the reporter arm. Both data and Friedrichsure bonbers mounted the guard at due to the punster engine arrangement, while A.E.G. AVs with their fasted mounted engines carried the guard around the front cockpit.

An artifact's impression of the patented Gotting 'gain tunned' shows the tunnel to be concave. The tunnel was actually more triangular in section, made of phycrood, and was some 15 feet (4.8 s) along. The tunnel ends approximately three feet (5 u) short of the fuselage kniggoot, the covered vertical start at the end of the tail.

(Above) The Gohta G.VII resembled the earlier G.VII, but was lighter and had a redesigned single bit unit and longer span wings. The defensive arrangement remained the same; however, power was provided by a pair of 245 \(\times\), six cylinder, Josephson Mb \(\times\)Vector mounted engines. The engines were not near the aircraft centre to improve aircraft performance in the event on engine had stopped. Only a few Gohta G.VIII were built and saw service during the last months of World War One.

The Type 8301 photosphere shixed the wing design of the Zepepton (Stasanel) R/N and the tail surfaces of the R.XIV/OY; however, the fuselage was a completely new design. Four machines are believed to have been built. The first Type 8301 arterial curves converted to a lampline configuration by adding both main and nose wheels and a tail solid.

The Type 8301's fuselage was suspended between the upper and lower manipanase, a feature that necessitated the use of a tail tone gear. This aircraft was powered by four 200 u/s.

Mercedes 0.7 Ws engines paired in tandem in the wing measles and turning both pushes and tractor properties. The Type 8301 is not known to have proceeded beyond the testing stage.

Zeppolin (Stasanel) built three R.XIVs and the identical R.XIV in 1918. The bombers were powered by the 245 \(\mu\)s Maryland h/o W engines and carried up to five defensive machine guns. The R.XIV, 4375, was brought down near Engles, France by Captain Yalle of 16, 151 Squadron, \(R\),_R_ during the night 42 \(\pm\) 2.40 y/s.

On 20 March 1918, the Cross State mission on German aircraft was officially changed to the straightidad Greed or Ballan Cross. R.XIV 4516 was met have black crosses, bor-dered in white, on the rudders and fuselage side. The bomber also appears to have four-bladed properties mounted on the pasture engines. Both the R.XIV and R.XIV were equipped with a large triangular vertical fit in joining the fuselage to the upper tail plane - a feature carried over from late production R.Vs.

(Right) R.V.4 4076 was completed too late for service, Like 4716, members of the Allied Control Commission discovered at the Stasasaken factory in 1919. Despite their nose wheels, the he-series bomsters normally sat on their trail asks. Like the d-series, the nose wheels were primarily designed to prevent nosing over during input landings on rough fields.
