F-14A

The production F-14A differed very little from the prototype/pre-production F-14As with the exception of the under nose chain selection speed and the rear fuselage area. Shortly after production began, the rear fuselage "bexer tall" was reconfigured to improve subsonic cruise performance and combat radius. The change went through three stages: the original configuration, an interim configuration, and the final production configuration. The interim change was installed on aircraft number eight/six and was retrofitted to earlier aircraft at Naval Research Facilities during scheduled overhauls. The production change went into effect with aircraft number eight/seven. During this change, the shape of the air breaks was also modified, the rear position was held was moved from the "beat tail" to the tip of the port vertical fan, and the stateboard chaff/lare disperser was moved to be alongside the port dispenser. Production - F14A have also been noted with several different style under nose sensor ports. Some bonds have ECM gear and an infrared sensor, others house just the ECM gear, while still others house just an infrared sensor. F-14s have also been noted with no pod being carried. Late production F-14As (Block 95 and later) have had the nose modified with the addition of a short tip tip into the mounted on the extreme end of the roadme. Additionally, the under nose speed on load one particle production F-14As carries the Northup developed Television Camera Set (TCS). The TCS optical unit is housed in the chip and when carrying the TCS, the infrared seker/ECM is mounted below the optical unit.

The TCS transit enables the aircurve to track and identify enemy aircraft beyond visual range (mostly two-three lines). In some cases, wears here reported being able to visually identify aircraft with the TCS at ranges in excess of nine miles. The T5 pictures also are stored on video by a video scottage recorded for the Latch Data Recording System (TODS). The TCS can be also located in the aircraft radar and will automatically search, acquire and look on its distant targets detected by the aircraft radar. The black and white video pictures are displayed on video screens in both the pilot and radar inter-top officers (ROI) ocpils.

The production F-14A had an overall length (including pitto) of sixty-two feet eight inches, a swing of unity, albeit two and one half inches (swapped) are used (see Figure 1). The wire angle of the stereo one and half inches (swapped) and a height of sixteen feet. The wire angle of the stereo one can be varied on par to 20 cm (86 degrees in length and for deck storage the wine can be over swept to 75 degrees, reducing the wing can bind to the horizontal sublazes. A wing gives each from the upper air intake faring when the wings are fully swept and the aircraft is at speeds exceeding Mach 1. The wing close compensates for aerodynamic forces and are manually controlled below Mach 1 and computer controlled above Mach 1. Empty weights 48,401 pounds, gross weight six broken miss miss miss 70,999 pounds and maximum weight is 43,499 pounds. The landing weight is 4513 pounds.

Production F-14A, like the prototype/pre-production aircraft, are powered by two 200,900 bits/Pratt and Whitney T5A-20A, while the production area. Early production air-smart used the PASP F-14A, like that production aircraft were fitted with the improved T5A-914A. In full afterburner, the F-14A has a maximum speed of Mach 2.4 (1.544 mph), while normalising speeds is 400-500 knots. The Tomact's landing speed is 132 knots, with air the 20 degree setting and satsl speed is 103 knots. The heart of the F-14A weapons system is the Hughes AW0-9 free control system. This system consists of a pulse Doppler radar with a look-down capability and a fire control computer. With an effective search range of over 170 nautical miles on narrow scan,F-14A,Number 12 (BUNO 158616) was used for catapoint tests at the Naval Air Test Center; Pak River, Maryland, during 1972. The tests included launched at various weights and with various missiles carried on the wing options. The aircraft carries a Red identification band on the nose and Black photographic reference stripes on the fuselage. (USN)

Delleires of production F-14As to the Fleet began in June of 1972. The Pacific Fleet Readiness Squadron, VF-14As, was the first to receive the Tomeat. VF-12A, based at Naval Air Station Whitmar, San Diego, California, was responsible for training both flight and ground cross for operational squadros. Two operational squadros were established to introduce the F-14A into the fleet. Figure Squadron Onve (VF-1) and Figure Squadron Two (VF-2) were officially re-established (both units were prior USN quadrants that had been decactivated) on 1 October 1972 at NAS Whitmar. After a period of intensive training and work-ups, the squadros made their initial deployment aboard USS NETERPRISE (CV-65) during September of 1974.

With the ENTERPRISE deployment, the F-14 was declared fully operational. The Tomeat's first combat missions were flown by VF-1 and F-2 during the US. evacuation of Saigon, Operation FREQUENT NW, conducted during the April of 1975, removed the last Americans from South Vietnam and Tomeat crews flelow Cahri Art Patrol (CAP) missions to protect the Fleet. The North Veterans Air Force, however, decided not interfere with the carriers and the F-14 across did not get the chance to their new mouths in combat.

The first Atlantic Fleet deployment of the F-14A was aboard USS JOHN F. KENNEDY (CV-67) during June of 1975. Higher Squadron Routren (VF-14) and Figure Squadron Thirty-two (VF-2) were assigned to the ship as part of Carrier Air Wing. Three, the second oldest Navy Air Wing. The highly successful cruise was completed during January of 1976, after serving six months with the 6th Fleet in the Mediterranean Sea.

In operational service, the F-14A performs three missions- long range intercept. Combat Air Patrot (CAP) and Barrier Combat Air Port (BARCAP). Additionally, Tomato are maintained on Five Minute Alert Watts (known as the A clear Five), acting as a deck launched interceptor (DLD) to counter intrudes that approach the Fleet for aircraft that get through the outer screen of patrolling Tomcats. As long range interceptor, the F-14A normally carries an armament of six AIM-54 Phoenix missiles. For short range missions, four Phoenix, we AIM-7 Sparrows and two AIA-9 Sildevinarcd would be carried. For BARCAP missions, either four Sparrows and four Sidewinders or six AIA-120 MARAAM missiles would be carried.

The F-14A is also capable of air-to-ground missions, although this is not a normal role for the Contact. For this role, the F-14A has the capability of carrying up to fourteen M8.2 500 around bombs, or eight M8.3 1000 found bombs, or four M8.4 2000 found bombs. Bombs and Sidewinders can be carried in combination, up to a maximum external load of 14,500 pounds.

As part of the ongoing F-14 update program, the Sparrow missile will eventually be replaced by the Hughes AIM-120 AMRAM (Advanced Medium Range Air-to-Air Missiles). The AMRAM is about one third of the night of AIA-7 Sparrow and has a greater range and larger around. Another missile scheduled for clearance for the F-14A the Texas Instruments AGM-88A HARM (High Speed Anti-Radiation Mission). HARM has been operational since December 1982 and was used by the A-68 and A-7s against LByan SA-5 radar sites during operation. EDORADO CANVON, on 24 March 1985. HARM uses a sophisticated esker and autophot to detect, identify and in none in hostile markets.

The F-14A is designed with various Electronic Counter Measures (ECM) equipment such as the AIA-V2-36M and Flatage: The dispensor is located in the lower portion of the rear fuselage underside. The unit can dispense shall, flares and various other rammer earnings with the E/G frequency bandpass. Normally, one dispensor is loaded on the F-14A, although there is provision for a second dispensor.

Two different style external field tanks can be carried on the F-14A. One tank has no fins and has a capacity of 270 galls, while the second style is equipped with fins and has a capacity of 267 galls. The finned tank is used only on the F-14A, while the fineless tank can be used either on the F-14A or the F-14A (Plus). The finned tank is currently being phased out, since it was found to cause a slight buffer as the F-14 approached transition goes.

The versatility of the F-14A has been further increased with the addition of TAMPs (Ticketal Aeronautics for System) pot under the flagsel of specially modified F-14As. Three are currently forty-seven F-14As in service that are capable of carrying the TAMPs. The system was designed to give the Nay an interim metelel photographic reconnaissance capability (but some in the R-X5 Ukraine waste were tested) until the dedicated RF-18 former enters fleet. TAMPs is seventeen fed into and is carried on these weapons stations for the. The pool contains three sensors and their associated equipment. The sensors carried include two position KS-87B rammer cameras for for-only and oblique and vertical photography, a 9th local focal length high-resolution K-89A low/medium altitude panoramic camera and an AAD-5A infrared line scan system. The good environmental control system (ECS) uses cooling air supplied from the carrying aircraft, in much the same manner as the AIA-5A Phoenix missile.

With the TAMPs pool in place, the F-14A still maintains its offensive and defensive weapons capability since any weapons station for is occupied by TAMPs. Under normal circumstances, there aircraft within a VF squadron (usually the number two squadron from within the Air Wing are TAMPs equipped. The first TAMPs deployment was with Fisher Squadron Eighty-four (VF-84) aboard USS NIMITZ (CVN-68).

The first operational F-14A system was W+1 Wolfpack based at Naval Air Station Grammar, California, W+ (and W-2) was commissioned during 1972 specifically to introduce the F-14A to the best of _F-1_ (asw) action aboard USS ENTERWISE (CW-85) during the April 1975 (asw) operation. The F-14A system was operated by the Pacific during the duration 1972. The system was operated by the Pacific at W-2 Bight (CW-86) at 1976. These aircraft are fitted with the modified bewer staff first introduced on aircraft eight-six. This modification was retrofitted to earlier Tomosts during their regular overhead. (USR)

This F-14A (Building 160380) was assigned to F-84-day-hophop generators SNMTZ (CWN-68) during 1972. The system was operated by the Pacific at W-2 Bight (CW-89) for deployment to the Mediterranean Sea. W-14C on massive consisted of a White skull and crossbones on a Black background.

## COMBAT

American relations with Libya were peaceful until COL Moammer El Gadhafi overtheve King flats I. One firmly in power, COL Gadhafi began a campaign of late and terrorism against the West and, in particular, the U.S. He left that the West had taken advantage of the Libya nebula to gain access to their eel reserves. As part of his cyanosit plans, Gadhafi declared that the territorial limit of Libyabar was extended out twelve miles. The U.S. felt this claim to be unlawful and set into motion a challenge to the Libya leader.

The first shooting incident took place on 19 August 1981 in the Gulf of Sidra. Although the Libya had fired on Navy aircraft that violated the twelve mile limit, the Navy had not returned the fire, since no Navy aircraft had been hit. Early in the morning on 19 August, two Libya Smith Sui-2 Futures took off from the former Wheeks Air Free Base near Trip Triped with Jew were teocured by coastal radar toward road to puffending 1-144 Tomcats.

**Iranian F-14A Program**

During 1974, the Shah of Iran, Mohammed Riza Sha Pahlevi, contracted with Grumman (through the Foreign Military Assistance Command for thirty Grumman F-14A) Tomacts for the Imperial Iranian Air Force (INPRO HAYAN SHAHAHAN SHAHAHAHTE: IRAN), The Shah wanted the Tomacts to counter the overliflifts of Iran by Soviet MIG-25 Foudas. The Soviets had been making regular Robert flights over the north-eastern border region and the IIAF had nothing capable of intercepting the high flying reconnaissance aircraft. During 1975, a second batch of fifty 14-ns was ordered. The aircraft produced between B308 and B305, were assigned Navy bus 16029 through 160378. For accounting purposes.

Esterally, Iranian F-14A were identical to the F-14As being Blown by the U.S. Navy, with the exception of the Fueling probe bay door, which was detected. Internally, the IAF-14A differed in the capabilities of the A/W-6 ring control system, the electronic counter measure (ECM) systems installed and the AM-54 missless. All of the electronic and missile systems were greatly downgraded, since it was left that if any of the sophisticated detector electron source was to fall into unfriendly hands it would put the U.S. at alias, advantage. This theory turned into fact when a disputrally Iranian Air Force pilot flev an F-14A across the Soviet border during the Iran/Irao War and landed at a Soviet military airfield. The pilot and aircraft were impounded and neither have been heard from since.

**F-14As on the ramp at Shwarz Air Base, Iran, prepare to start engines for a training mission during 1977. These aircraft are from the second production batch of fifty aircraft ordered during 1978. The IAF Tomacts had the door covering the refueling probe bay deleted. (Grumman)**

Deliveries of F-14As to the IIAF began during January of 1976 and all but one aircraft had been delivered by July of 1978. Iran had also ordered 424AM-54A Phoenix missiles, but by 1979 only 270 had been delivered. The Tomacts were assigned to four squadrons stationed at Khatami Air Base near Isfahan and at Shizra Air Bases. Both these bases were located near the Iran/Soviet border.

During 1977, the Shah had expressed an interest in purchasing an additional seventy F-14A, with an estimated value of 900 million dollars. This sale was never consummated since Grumman was engaged in producing the initial Iranian order and the political climate in Iran had become extremely unstable. Between 1976 and February of 1979 the IIAF lost free-14As to various accidents. On 16 January 1979, the Shah of Iran was deployed by the disgisad MANUAL Mombien: Shortly after the fall of the Shah, supplies of sparera to keep the F-14SO operational were stopped and the Grumman technicians were called home. The newly renamed Islamic Republic of Iran Air Force (IHAF) was forced to maintain the F-14s with their own technicians and with foreign technicians hired from various western and asian nations.

In September of 1980, the Iran-Irao war broke out when neither side could agree to a 1975 treaty that gave Iran control of the oil ten territory of Khatzian. During the war, it was able to keep anymore from seven to ten F-14As operational at any one time (although Iranian claims are much higher). By 1986, there were no Phoenix missiles operational and the aircraft were armed with Sidewater and Suryonmissles. Throughout the war a severe shortage of tires and brakes kept the majority of F-14s grounded and an effort to locally produce tires and brake pads proved fruitless. The Iranians had to rely on the unreliable aircraft past shack maker, which managed to keep a small amount of spares coming into the country.

During the Iran-Irao war the Iranians lost at least three F-14s in air-to-air combat. Two were shot down by Mirage F-1 fighters and one was shot down by a MIG-21, reportedly armed with French Matre Magic air-to-air missiles. The Iranians normally used

F-14B

The F-14B resulted from a Navy-Grumman program aimed at replacing the troublesome F-30 engines of the F-14A with more reliable and powerful Part & Whitney F-401-2040 engines. Two F-14A airframes (BNo15 157986 and BuNo 158630) were converted to serve as prototype aircraft for the F-14B SuperTonac program. The first prototype, BuNo 157986, was fitted with two 2x 20,100 Isb Prat and Whitney F-401-P40b trudson engines replacing the 20,900 Ibst Prat and Whitney F-301-2A engines. Besides the increase in the new engines has ended another advantage; they weight some 600 pounds. Is Additionally, the F-401-P40b was a derivative of the Prat and Whitney F-100-P40b engine, used in the McDennel Douglas F-15A Eagle and had a degree of commonly with an Air Force power plant. The first F-14B prototype made its first night on 12 September 1973 and, after completion of a series of flight tests, the aircraft was withdrawn from service and place into long term storage.

During 1981, the F-14B prototype (BNo 157986) was taken out of storage and fitted in a part of General Electric F-10DFE (Deriving Figure 1). After a short initial flight test program, the F-14B was put through an evaluation program that lasted thirty-three flight hours. Beginning on July 1981, some twenty-two Grumman and They have yet flights were conducted with the F-14B which revealed a number of technical problems on the engine installation. Grumman, however, discovered that with the F10DFE engines, the F-14B could accelerate from March 0.8 to March 1.8 in their seconds. The F-14B was also able to be calculated from a carrier bed without the use of the arthreur. Navy test plots that out that the additional thrust, they were able to fly the aircraft, rather than the engines, as they had to do in the standard F-14A.

At a normal weight of 6,500 pounds, the F-10DFE powered F-14B had a power to weight ratio of almost one one one. This enabled the F-14B to accelerate while in the retrieval, a maneuver and TST-30 powered F-14A could not accomplish.

Externally, the F-14B appeared identical to the F-14A except for the engines and the addition of a television camera system test pod. The aircraft carried no AWG.9 9 arrays. Then, the space being taken up by the racks for specialized test instruments. The test program was terminated in September of 1981 and again the F-14B prototype was placed in storage.

Assend A-14B (BNo 158630) was being built with En. September (1981), the Navy created the F-14B program and decided that it would continue F-14A production with the Pratt and Whitney F-301-42A engines. As a result, the second prototype (BuNo 158630) was converted back to a late production F-14A.

In July of 1984, a contrast was issued to Grumman to install General Electric augmented trudson F-110G-640 engines in the F-14B prototype and in July of 1986, initial flightting began. The tests were highly successful and led directly to the Navy decision to go ahead with the F-14A (PLUS).

During 1983, a joint contract was issued to Martin-Marietta and General Electric to develop a dual in optical/electronics pod for the Tomcat that would contain both the Television Camera Set (TCS) and the Infrared Search and Track Set (RSTSTs). This dual was successfully test shown on the F-14B prototype and is proganed to become part of the F-14D program.

The F-14B prototype has been used to test the various upgrades that are to be used on late production F-14A. When the aircraft is not needed for testing, it is placed in temporary or long term storage at Bethpage until needed.

### F-14c

At one point during the F-14B program. Grumman proposed an updated development of the F-14B to be designated the F-14C. The F-14C was to have incorporated upgraded across, an improved radar and a fine control system compatible with the E-2C, A-6 and FA-18. It was to have been powered by the General Electric F-10DFE (Deriving Figure 1) through engines being tested on the F-14B. Other proposed features included a programmable signal processor, increased computer memory, the Improved Laser-Forge Inertial Navigation System. A non-cooperative target identification system and a television camera system (TCS). All of these features were later incorporated into late production F-14A, the F-14A (Plas) and some are programed for the F-14D. In the event, the Navy decided not to produce the F-14C aircraft.

### Tomcat 21

Another proposal, made by Grumman to meet the requirements of the Advanced Technical Fisher (AIF) program, used the company designation Tomcat 21. The Tomcat 21 proposal, of recorded, would result in an aircraft more advanced than the F-14D. The Tomcat21 fault feature an airframe and another more compact materials to reduce the aircraft's considerable radar signature and the addition of avionics that would allow the T20 I attack ground targets, while retaining its air-to-air capability. The Tomcat 21 would be powered by high bypass turbofan engines to increase fuel efficiency (and range).

At the present time, Grumman has not received the funding necessary to proceed with research and development (25 Billion) and prototype construction. If funding should be forthcoming, the Tomcat 21 program would result in an aircraft with inherent percent of the request capability of the Advanced Tactical Fisher (AIF) for about sixty percent of the cost of a totally new aircraft.

**The number seven F-14A prototype on the ramp at Grumman just before being re-engined with Pratt and Whitney F-401-PW-400 turbofans. With the new engines, the Navy designated the extent of the F-14B and Grumman named it the Super Tonac. The aircraft was in overall Glosa Inaugina White with Red stripes and Black trim. (Grumman)**The F-14B prototype, in formation with a Northrop-F-50 VF-43, lies over the Atlantic contiguity 1981. The General Electric F101 DFE engines provided the F-14B with considerably more thrust than the standard Part and Whitney-7-30-9412 engines. The GF101 engine was originally designed for the Rockwell B-1 and was also tested in the General Dynamic F.

Once flight testing with the F-401 engine was completed, the F-148 was put into long term storage. (Grumman)

The F-14B prototype carries Phoenix missiles on the fuselage patients. Soarrows on the wing pylors, and Siderwinders on the wing shoulder pylors during early 1987. The aircraft was also equipped with two 279 gallon fuel tanks. Even though its carrying Phoenix missiles, the aircraft could not fire them, since it had no AWR-6 radar installed. (Grumman)

The F-14B program originally had two aircraft assigned. The second aircraft was Bultto 15630 and when the F-14B program was cancelled during 1971, the aircraft was reconfigured to F-14A standards. The aircraft was issued to F-201, Carrier Air Reserve Wing Twenty (CVW-20) at NAS Dallas, Texas. (Grumman)

## 6 NASA Tomcat

In June of 1985, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Ames-Dryden

High Research Facility at Edwards Air Force Base, California. (in conjunction with the Navy and Grumman) began a series of experiments with a flight control system known as the Aliero-Rudader Incomeor or ARL The system was installed on an F-14A Tomcat (interntern sampler X, BuNo 15799) located to NASA by the Navy. The ARM was designed to coordinate turns, prevent Wing rock and resist using during conditions of high angle of attack.

In earlier high angle of attack flight tests with the F-14 conducted by Chuck Sewell, Grumman's chief test pilot, Chuck had noted that the F-14 experienced a loss of roll response. These tests totaled stolen flights, during which Sewell was able to control the aircraft at high angles of attack, even though air speed dropped to somewhere between 0 and 300 Knes. These tests were made with the aircraft in a clean configuration. The distal vantage in the loss of roll response at high angles of attack was that, in combat an F-14A a steep nose high climb would not be able to rapidly change direction by rolling into a turn.

For the ARL tests, extensive modifications were made to the aircraft's analog flight control system and the nose was modified with movable enamel control surfaces. The flight control system modifications included a cross control feature that allowed the pittor toll the aircraft opposite to lateral stick input, by use of order to peak joint input. This gave the F-14 pilot roll response for tacit maneuvering while the aircraft was at a high angle of attack (e.g. nose up climb).

The ARL tests were made by three Navy pilots and one Grumman test pilot. Two of the Navy pilots were from the Naval Air Test Center at Pattanen River, Maryland, while the wind was from the Pacific Mististist Center at Pattanen River, California.

The tests showed that the ARL modifications gave the TOT improved roll performance at high angles of attack (above 30 degrees), while retaining gains resistance and wing rock speeds. With the ARL system installed, the pilots reported that there was no reduction in the good basis flying qualities of the F-14. The tests were made in both a clean configuration and while carrying external stores.

Upon completion of the Aliero-Rudader Incomeor experiment, NASA began another series of tests during 1986 to investigate the airflow characteristics of variable sweep wings. The program was called the Variable Sweep Flight Test Experiment program. The experiment involved the installation of special moving coverings that would alter the airflow over the wing. It was expected that that gained from the experiment would aid in the design of future small or transport aircraft. The modifications were done in conjunction with NASA's Langley Research Center and the Boeing Commercial Airplane Company, Seattle, Washington.

The covering, or wing glove, was designed to smooth the airflow over the wing and lead to more fuel efficient flight at high subsion and transonic speeds. The glove was installed to the leading edge and upper surface of the wing.

The goal of the NASA and Boeing researchers was to gain information on the airflow close to the surface of the wing, known as the boundary layer. The test results were added to a data base available to aircraft designers to draw upon as the planned smaller commercial trianged aircraft. The F-14 TOT was chosen to perform the tests since it had variable sweep wings and an aircraft was readily available on loan from the Navy.

An F-14A (BuNo 159834) was fitted with a glove made of fiberglass/foam composite of about one half an inch thick. A layer of fiberglass was applied to the wing, then a foam core, then several additional layers of fiberglass. Measuring devices were embedded in the glove during the manufacturing process so that a smooth surface was maintained for natural laminar airflow.

The flight test program was conducted in two phases, both at subsonic and transonic speeds, using different wing slopes and with the wings swept at varying degrees from 20 to 35 degrees. The first phase of the flight test program included twenty flights using a glove that simulated the F-14A audio airflow. This provided a base line data base for comparison once the second phase of the program began.

During the second phase, wing slopes were specially designed for speeds of 7. Mach (approximately 450 miles per hour) and 8 Mach (S25 mph). Preliminary test results indicated the wing coverings, which basically smoothed out the normal wing airflow, achieved more laminar at higher pressure than were simply angles that the standard F-14 wing. Video from a chase aircraft gave researchers a close up look at the actual airflow over the wing, made possible by the use of liquid crystals imodesed in the surface of the gloves.

Once these tests were completed during the Fall of 1987, the aircraft was reconfigured to 1-14 standards and returned to the Navy for use in the fleet.

F-14A standards and returned to the Navy for use in the fleet.

## F-14d

During November of 1987, a highly modified F-14A took off from Grumman's Calverton facility. Although externally it appeared to be a standard F-14A- that the aircraft side number 501, Busho 1681655 carried the radar, avionions and digital instrumentation intended for use in the F-14D Super Torncar program. The F-14D program was envisioned by both the Navy and Grumman as a way of providing the Navy with a state-of-the-art interception/brighter at substantial savings.

The F-14D Super Torncar is basically an F-14A (Plus) and with advanced digital avionions, instrumentation, and an improved radar. Experimentally, the F-14D offers the F-14A (Plus) in the use of an data optical electronics chip which ionised us from the standard TS system and an Infrared Search and Track System (ISST) and the detection of the wing above GCM ratings. Under the terms of the development/production contract signed in July of 1988, aircraft beginning with Grumman Fabrication number 596 (BuBuL 163412), production block 155, will have the updates and carry the design-on F-14D.

One important part of the F-14D Super Torncar program is the Hughes AN/APG-71 radar. Radar. With high speed digital processing, this radar confers a six fold improvement system, information processing over current Hughes AWG-9 system. The AN/APG-71 radar has monopious angle tracking and a digital scan control. The monopious technique locates the target precisely within the radar bank while the system remains its look-down, has shoot-down pulse Doppler scan/track capability. The system can track up to twenty-four targets, while guiding six misseds to their individual targets at an engagement range of 100 miles. Target altitudes may be very far from 80 to 80,000 feet.

The avionics upgrade will replace the older analog type equipment with state-of-the-art digital electronics equipment. The majority of the avionics fitted to the F-14A will be compatible with the equipment installed in the latest installers of the F-14A-18 as well as the A-B. Other avionions improvements will include two A-14 mission exposures, programmable digital controls and displays. an AN/13-9 digital inertial navigation system, a digital stores management system and an infrared search and track system (ISTISTs) housed in the same pod as the television camera set (TCS). A Tactical Data Recording System (TODS) is installed in conjunction with the TCS the TDRS is basically an obstructed video cassette (VCR) tied to the TCS. The dual post was developed by each, the General Electric/Martin Mariet and was first test down on the F-14B (BuNo 157986) prototype as part of the F-14A (Plus) program.

The other filters in the F-14A update include an ALR-67 Radar Warning Receiver. The dual-to-L56 Airborne Self-Perceptional Nammer, the Joint Trostal Information Distribution System (THDS) and the Naval Aircraft Common Escystem (NACES). The THDS is a sensor filter to higher order data link for both voice and radar information. The system allows one F-14A-based filter to pass radar information to one or more F-14B loss that is on the aircraft could remain radar silent. Another advantage is that other aircraft in the vicinity such a F-14B or less F-25 could receive radar information while operating their radaras in a standby mode (not transmitting). Alternatively, the F-14D can receive data link information from the E-2C while remaining radar silent.

The (NACES) system is the Martin-Baker Mik 14 zero-tunch ejection seat. This seat is equipped with an electronic sequerer that automatically adjusts the seats' operation to take into account the afterfalls speed and attitude at the precise moment of ejection.

The F-14D is cleared to carry a number of advanced air-to-air and air-to-ground weapons, including the Hughes AN/12-0 Advanced Medium Range Air-to-Air Missile (AMRAMM) which is currently scheduled to replace the AIM-7Sparrow medium range missile. The AMRAMM is capable of being launched at an enemy aircraft beyond visual range and receive midcourse targeting information updates from the launch aircraft via data link. In the terminal phase, the AMRAMM's on board radar seker guides it independently to the target without further assistance from the launch aircraft.

The AIM-12-0 is on third the weight of an AIM-7 and has a fifth pound blast-fragment warned with a "smarter" site. Its has a look-down, shoot-down capability and can be launched and may target seperate angle throughout the flight envelope of the launch-ing aircraft. The AMI-12-0 is compatible with the same launch rail used for the AIM-7 Sparrow without modification.

Hughes Air is also working on improved variables of the Phoenix air-to-oquiar mis-shaped face designations AIM-54C (Plus) and AIM-54C (Plus/Advanced). The AMRAMM-54C (Plus) will have a built in code capability, eliminating the need to receive cooling at the front of the Torncar. The SAM-54C (Plus) also has improvements in its Electronic Counter Counter Counter Measures (ECCOM) system. Furthermore improvements are being developed that will cease mislight production and increase the weapon's launch range.

The F-14D is powered by the same General Electric/F-110G-420 engines used in the F-14A (Plus). The GF-14D engines increase available thrust to 56,400 pounds and provides significant improvements in operation, reliability, maintainability and fuel consumption. The GF-110G-420 has over eight percent commonality in parts with the Air Force F-110G-420 is now either used in the F-15 and F-16, ensuring spare parts procurement for both services.

The F-14D is cleared for carrying air-to-ground weapons and, while this capability is always near by part of the Torncar weapons and, the F-14D has the improved radar and a HUD (Head Up Display) that is very similar to that used on the F-14D framework. The F-14D charge the BRU-3-Bomb rack, the same bomb rack used on the F-14A-18 which will greatly improve the ground attack capability of the Torncar. This bomb rack is capable of handling all air-to-ground weapons in the Navy inventory. Additionally, the F-14D will be able to use the AGM-78 Standard Arm-at-radiation missile.

Production of the upgraded Torncar began during March of 1990 and current plans for future new production (F-14D) and the remainder of six low time F-14A air-to-groundings for F-14D standards during 1990. The F-14D program calls for production of a total of 12 new production F-14D data at a rate of twelve per year and for the remainder of 400 F-14A/8 to F-14D standards, resulting in an all F-14D fleet by 1998.

This F-14A was used as the flat scale development market for the F-14D program. The Torncar, and another 501 (BuL 168165) made its first flight from the Grumman Calverton Development Test Center during November of 1987. The aircraft was a standard F-14A with 14D radar, avionics and instrument panels. (Grumman)
