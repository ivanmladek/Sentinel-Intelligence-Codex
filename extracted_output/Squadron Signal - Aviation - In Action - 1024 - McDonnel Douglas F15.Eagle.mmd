## BACKGROUND

As any fighter pilot will tell you, air superiority is the key of tactical airpower. The success of all other tactical air missions depends upon first attaining and then maintaining air superiority - that is, eliminating effective interference by the opposing air force. Control of the air will bear significantly on the outcome of the battle.

Combat experience has taught that encounters between fighters capable of high altitude and supersonic flights normally take place below 2000 feet at speeds slower than 1. As the flight progresses, visibility limitations and basic physics keep the aircraft in the transonic flight regime - that area around March 1.

As a result, the fighter pilot has been continually asking for more maneuverability, close-in weapons, and a better understanding of the inherent performance capabilities of his aircraft during a dogtight. Thus, quality - and not speed alone - in the air at medium and low altitudes is the prime requisite for success in air-to-air engements.

This was one of the tactical lessons learned in Southeast Asia - that the fastest was not necessarily the best. It was the acceleration, the climbing/diving, the turning, the positioning, the ability to get the best angle first that the pilot needed.

The Air Force was stringent in its demands for performance in a new fighter when feasibility studies began in 1965. With its prime purpose of air superiority, it would be the first of its type since the F-86 Sabergiot, introduced in 1948. Prerequisites included excellent cockpit visibility, panel and instrument design, engine and flight control response, integrated components to perform multiple functions and a faster turn-around time on the ground.

On January 1, 1970, the die was cast. McDonnell-Douglas Aircraft Company was awarded the go-ahead development contract.

Twenty F-158 were ordered for the research and development programs. These fighters were specially modified to conduct the ground and flying test phases.

Two and a half years after the "go-ahead," on June 26, 1972, the first F-15 Eagle was officially welounced off the production line in a rollout ceremony at McDonnell-Douglas headquarters in St. Louis.

One month after rollout, on July 27, 1972, the Eagle took to the air on its initial flight.

From the very beginning, pilots praised the F-15's outstanding maneuverability, performance and handling qualities as "feeling like a fighter," A test pilot put in fighter pilot turns when he said," It's a genuine pleasure to suck the Eagle into a turn that leaves any chase airplane staggering around, unable to hold the G or the speed."

The Eagle is the most advanced and most maneuverable high-speed fighter ever developed, designed to meet and exceed the challenges of the 1980s. It can out-climb, out-manewer and out-accelerate any fighter threatin existence or on the horizon. The Eagle was specifically designed for the most strenuous combat performance.

The F-15 is a single-search, fixed wing fighter in the 40,000 pound class. Its twin, tresque-mounted turboa, afterforming engines, built by Pattl A. Whitney, provide the F-15 with speeds in excess of Mach 2. It is capable of supersonic speeds above 65,000 feet. Each F-100 powerlawl, weighing 3,000 pounds, can produce approximately 25,000 pounds of thrust. Because of advanced engine technologies, aerodynamics and lightweight materials, the Eagle has the capability of producing more pounds of thrust than its total take-of-weight = a first or up 1.5 tighter.

The F-15 can accelerate to supersonic speeds while climbing vertically, in its air-to-tail combat role, this high engine thrust, combined with low wing loadings, provides low drag at both low and high lift to achieve an agility in the air unmatched by any current fighter aircraft in the world.

Advanced technology is represented in almost every section of the engine - the fan, compressor, combustor, turbine and nozzle. The engine's high thrust-to-weight ratio also stems from extensive use of improved materials to reduce weight. The F100 as a thrust-to-weight ratio in the eight-to-one class.

## Appendix B Flying the F-15

### By Capt. Don Carson, USAF

EDWARDS AFB, CALIF..-My tap muscles tightened as 1 held the brakes and eased the throttles up to military power. Checking the gauges, I released the brakes and selected afterburner. The airspeed climbed rapidly, at 120 knots, I raised the nose ten degrees above the horizon, and we broke ground in about 1,000 feet.

Gear and flaps up, I quickly pulled back on the street and climbed in a thirty-five degree pitch altitude while accelerating to 250 knots. At 10,000 feet, I pulled the throttles out of afterburner, as briefed, and rolled the aircraft over, I could not believe it... We had not traveled even halfway down the 150,000-round runway at Edwards AFB, Calif.

I have twin fast airplanes before, but nothing that could come near that date itself in an F-15. With an interwaising air beneath my oxygen mask, I climbed to 16,000 feet in military power to continue the mission.

I was flying in the F-15A with Mr. Denny Behm, a McDonnell Douglas experimental test pilot. Denny was working the radar and would demonstrate the capabilities of the F-15 in its air-superiority (role while I fleve the bird. We were trying with a T-38 chase aircraft that was also serving as our target.

Heading to the Teachaudi Range era, Denny set up the radar for the intercept. The target was many miles away as we turned to meet him head on. He appeared on the scope before we had rolled out. Denny locked on to the T-38 immediately, and we headed toward it. We broke the radar lock-on, as briefed, and instructed the target to descend and continue on the deck. When the T-38 called level, we again locked on to him in a "look-down" intercept.

The radarchoose was completely clear of ground clutter. The only returns on the scope were those of the target and another afterstart passing through our flight area. I had been very skeptical of claims for the F-15 radar and its look-down capability. Every other radar set I have created was always filled with the clutter of ground returns, making it very difficult to pick out your target when looking down. Not so with the F-15. Anyon who could pick out your target on this scope needs his eyes checked. This look-down capability gives a fighter pilot the needed ability to pick out his target from the weeks.

I pressed in to the target and, at five miles, I began following the cap-like Alto-air air-to-air missile, steering on the scope as I swung around to the T-38 s stem.

### Pressing the Attack

There is never any doubt what is happening during an F-15 intercept. The Visual Situation Display (VSD) scope gives the pilot all the information he needs to complete any intercept. The targets range, altitude, speed, heading, closure rate, G-force, and aspect angle are displayed in easily read numerals right on the (VSD, You) always know if your target is climbing, diving, or turning to avoid you. Most of this information is also displayed on the Head-Up Display (HUD) once you have locked on to your target. The HUD and VSD also indicate when you are in range for the missiles you have selected and the number of missiles remaining. Radar controls are easy to operate and conveniently located on the throttle and stick. There is no need to remove your hands from the flight controls when conducting an attack. This is a single-set fighter, and it was designed to make the job as easy as possible for the pilot.

We closed into range on the T-38, and the in-range indicator on the VSD and HUD told us we could launch signals at any time. I continued steering the dot as we simulated launch and closed into gun range. Moving the weapons-select switch on the Inside of the right throttle, we placed the windows into the gun mode. The HUD display now gave information for a gun attack. Displayed were gun rounds remaining, a gun cross showing the potential line, eight trelic, radar range, and a box indicating target position.

The target designer box is especially valuable to a pilot during an intercept: If you have a radar lockon, the box will indicate where to look to pick the target on visually. You may be too far out to see the target, but the designer box will pinpoint this position, so you will know where to look for him when he comes into gang. Closing on the T-38, we were given an in-range cue on the HUD when we were within gun range. I rolled off and pulled up as we reached minimum range and had completed the simulated attack.

The T-38 was now briefed to go into some hardware defensive maneuvering as I attempted tracking him again. I still into a comfortable sh/clock position at 800 feet as the T-38 afterburners lift and he began a series offive- and six-G turns to lose us. I easily maintained tracking position and, in fact, had to throttle back to about thirty percent rpm to keep from over-running him. We followed him straight up and down and through every defensive turn he could make, and I never needed to use the afterburners once. Even in a hard turn, the F-15 is smooth and does not buffet.

The wing loading of the F-15 is fifty-six pounds per square foot foot. This is much lower than most tighters flying today and is the prime reason for the F-15 can turn so well. The wings are large and do not require slats or any other tilt device to help in a turn. The F100 engines enable the F-15, which weighs about 40,000 pounds at kasteroid, to sustain turns far beyond the capabilities of most aircraft flying. The F-15 can start a four-G turn at 20,000 feet and Mach 0.9, and within 180 degrees of turn, can climb to more than 27,000 feet. For comparison, this is where F-4 can just hold a level turn at four Gs.

Firmly convinced that I could easily handle a T-38 target without even using military power, I joined on his wing and flew some close formation. The F-15 is a delight to fly in formation. The flight controls and power response are excellent. The aircraft is very stable throughout its envelope and feels like a T-38 or F-106 in roll rate and pitch sensitivity.

The stick is fairly heavy and feels similar to an F-105. Most pilots who have flow from the F-105, myself included, believe that the Thut has the best stick feel and stability of any aircraft flying. The F-15 is equal to the F-105 in this respect and offers far better maneuverability. This stability is quite important when flying someone's wing in weather or in night formation when you really have to hang in close.

### Nothing to Criticize

I could not find anything in the F-15's flight controls to criticize. The aircraft uses a system of hydromechanical linkage and a dual-channel Control Augmentation System (CAS) for roll, pitch, and yaw control: The allergens are controlled by mechanical linkage only. CAS roll inputs are provided through the differential stabilator and the rudder. The CAS creates no noticeable changes in feet, and contributes significantly to the solid stability of the F-15 in flight. The excellent roll rate of the F-15 is accomplished by using the alterations and differential movement of the stipulations. The stabilators work differentially in conjunction with the allergens to produce roll and together to produce pitch.

Should the CAS system malfunction or be shot out, the aircraft is fully controllable by the hydromechanical fiducial-control system. The flight controls also incorporate an effective pitch-trim compensator (PTC). The PTC automatically adjusts for changes in pitch caused by speed transitions, speed-brake operation, and weapons release. This is very helpful when you extend the speed breaks while tracking a target.

The speed breaks currently used on the F-15 test aircraft were inadequate and have been changed on production models. The speed brake on the test aircraft opened sixty degrees, but was not large enough to provide the needed deceleration. Speed brakes on the production models have a larger surface area and open only forty degrees, while providing greater drag. The speed brake location behind the pilot on the top of the aircraft has been criticized by some pilots flying the F-15. They believe that, when the speed brake is extended, visibility is somewhat restricted at six clock. The best answer to this was given by the TAC F-15 Project Director, Col. Frank Bloomomberg. We said, with a smile, "it anyone is flying around with his speed brake out while he has a MIG at this site or clock, be desenses to be shot down." 1 agree, and 1 did not find the speed brake to be a problem during my flights.

This is probably a good time to comment on the F-15 clock visibility. If it, is, by far, the best in any fighter ever owned by the USAF. That is a strong statement, but it is true. You sit high in a huge bubble canopy that extends down almost to your waist. You have enough room to move around and look over the canopy rails or turn around and see both rudders behind you. That gives all the visibility 1 could ever ask for. There is a slight blind spot in the near caused by the seat calls. This is very small and does not pose a serious restriction. All you have to do is more you read a few inches, and you can see around the rails. Plots testing the \(F\)-15 are not satisfied with this, but this is really picking at the fine points. The visibility, even with the existing rails, is at least twice that of any current tighter.

The ejection seat, however, does pose a problem. The seat is uncomfortable, and it is difficult to turn around to look behind due to the straps that attach the pilot to the seat-mounted parachute. The problem has been recognized, and a fix is included on production aircraft to lengthen the straps and permit pilots to more easily turn around and look behind. Comfort should be improved by changes to the seat exclusion. These problems are minor and do not present any restriction to successful operations. Having someone at your six clock will not be a problem in the \(F\)-15. If the does manage to get there, he will not stay for very long.

### Shooting an ILS Approach

After completing a couple more intercepts, we headed over to the Palmale Airport, and 1 shot an ILS approach. The instruments are well located, and the entire cockpit is designed with the pilot in mind. The radio,IFF, HUD controls, instruments, and weapons panel are all effective in front. There has been a lot of planning in the cockpit layout, and it is set up for one-man operation. Three will never be a need to bend over of turn to the side to change a radio or FF frequency when you are flying in FF conditions on the wing of another aircraft. Even the systems and lighting controls on the right-hand and the left-hand consoles have different-shaped topgle handles so the pilot can feel which switch he is reaching without looking down. At last we are getting something fighter pilots have begged for over the years-a cockpit laid out for the man who is going to use it, not to satisfy an engineer sitting behind a desk.

Picking up the localizer, I turned for tiny ILS approach at fifteen miles and lowered the gear and flaps. There is no change in aircraft pitch feel as the gear and flaps go down. The approach may be flow on the conventional attitude indicator display, using the ILS steering bars, or by using the ILS display on the HUD. This is the preferred method and enables the pilot to check for the runway during poor visibility while monitoring the instruments. The HUD represents all information needed to successfully fly an ILS approach without looking down into the cockpit.

Intercepting the ILS glide slope, I extended the speed brake and noticed here was still no change in pitch. The \(F\)-15 flies a stable and easily controllable approach at about 1400 knots and ninet units* angle of attack. It you allow the angle of attack to get 20.5 units, you begin to get a very mild but briefest is remedied by adding about one percent rpm. The \(F\)-15 should be an excellent all-weather aircraft due to instrument location, stability, and the relatively slow speeds at which it flies final approach.

I executed a missed approach at ILS minimum and cleaned up the speed brake, gear, and flaps. We headed toward the high-speed corridor for a supersonic run. Climbing out, 1 did several rolls at low speed. The aircraft responded well and exhibited no adverse handling characteristics. Once in the corridor, I plugged in the burners and, with amazing acceleration, passed through the Mach. I tried several supersonic rolls at 20,000 feet and some very hard turns. The aircraft handles easily and turns exceptionally well even at supersonic speeds.

The performance of the F100 engines is fantastic. In military power, the F-15 will outperform almost anything flying today, and, with the Hamburg wing, it seems just too good to be true. Coming out of afterburner, I continued a very hard turn to bleed off the speed and let the air-center so obtained. This is a critical area in most flighters, where they dip in as the speed slows through Mach 1. To prevent overtressing an aircraft, pilots must ease off the 6s as they go through the Mach. This is a major problem when you are trying to output a target or track him. The F-15 glid backup through the transaction area into subsonic flight with hardly a noticeable change in fuel. These rules, if any, dig-in that I could feel.

The red plong fuel light came on to indicate that we were at the fuel level we had dialed into the gauge. This light is set by the pilot and should remain running out of fuel during the heat of a doglet. The entire fuel system is automatic. There is no tank selecting required by the pilot to get all of his test. The pilot can concentrate on the air battle until his plong light comes on, indicating it's time to disengage and head home. More than one tighter has been lost during a dogfit because it ran out of fuel.

Back in the Edwards traffic pattern, we lowered the gear and flaps and showed to final approach speed. The aircraft touched down at 110 knots and, with aerodynamic braking, rolled to a stop in plenty of time to turn off at midfield.

There was a significant problem with the crosswind landing stability during early testing of the F-15. The pilots had a feeling that they were going to roll over in a strong wind. This problem has been solved with a much stiffer landing gear. The aircraft now handles well in up to thirty knots of crosswind.

The F-15 does not use a drag chute since it has slow landing speed and excellent brakes. There is an operational tail hook for emergency barrier engagerments. We taxied into the ramp, opened the canopy, and took off our masks. It is quiet in the cockpit, even with the canopy open. You can leave your mask hanging without blasting out the other pilot with the noise picked up in the intercom.

The insowheheel steering is continuous and has two modes. Normal steering is automatic and is available anytime the aircraft is running. To obtain more sensitive steering, you must hold the nosewheel steering button on the stick. Both modes work well and give the pilot the stability of dampened steering for long straight taxiways and sensitive steering for tight turns.

I taxied back to the parking area, and, with a signal from the crew chief, we shut down the engines and climbed out. I am sure that I was spinning like a postsun as we talked to the maintenance men who were around the aircraft. As a matter of fact, I think I was still spinning when I went to sleep many hours later. The F-15 is quite an airplane!

The Day the Eagle Streaked

By Major Roger J. Smith

On February 1, 1975, a US Air Force F-15 Eagle broke its eighth time-to-climb record in seventeen days, shattering all existing marks established by a US Navy F-4 Phantom and a Soviet Milo-25 Fex combat. The pilot who made the final assault on the records lies his story.

Saturday, February 1, 1975, draws cold and clear in Grand Forks, N.D., contrary to the forecast of the previous evening _Vascular forecasting_, in North Dakota in a place at a place at that a science. Weather front originating here. A typical forecast is, "Clear to partly cloudy with a chance of snow" that leaves it of room for change.

To set the alarm radio for 6:00 a.m. event rate, a music, 1ean across my white to turn down. Marlin came up from Edwards AR Best Sunday. That was my white to birthday, and the day had finished we would set the 30,000-meter-time-time-time-by records for about full-life hours that lie fully begins at forty. Instead, "Dave Peterson, another of the Project Streak Eagle pilots, knocked off the 25,000-meter record that day, and "Hiben was too late to try for 30,000. The rest of the week has been allergies of frustrations.

Monday was had a shot at 30,000 meters, but the temperature at 38,000 feet, the acceleration altitude was not degrees above the standard of minus 56.2 Clus. The big Pratt & Winey 1:00 km can engine that power the F-15 couldn't produce the acceleration required to set world class time-to-climb records at that temperature.

Also the fifty-five-degree dimfind-like shown by the flight simulation to be optimum for the final climb hand/decadeade for the city fifty knots of taintly, which would add total inertial energy for the conversion of speed into altitude.

So much for Monday. I didn't do not fit the 89,425 feet resulted for the 30,000-meter record. Two thousand feet, Stont, Tousday, Wedensday, and Thwards were devoted to insisting modified engine control and watching the bad weather. On Friday, we had two-hour to make the weather, but the aircraft pitch trim control wouldn't, wrt eigh out starts by the time the mechanics and engineers sorted that ting, "the time-by-use/infresh" makes track.

Let me explain what we need for weather. Because wall fee is shutting the engines down at the top of the climb and restartingtingting, back down, we want clear skies and ten miles of visibility at Grand Forks/and Fang=out landing alternate. We need standard temperature, or goaler, at acceleration, attitude and all the tailwind we can get out of the northwest surface-Energoour only alternative, is southeast of Grand Forks. This is no small order for North Dakota in winter.

Weather and Systems "Go"

Today is Saturday, February 1. At 6.00 a.m., I stumble into the bathroom to shave and wake up, before I call the weatherman. As I look out the window, I see stars and a setting moon. No clouds!

My subsequent call is not very encouraging. The weatherman says it might be clear now, but let's stand on his original forecast of clear to partly cloudy with a chance of snow--at least until the soin comes up.

On Saturday, we don't have people automatically report for work unless we think there is reason for optimism after the 6:00 a.m. weather check. The final weather check is in the radar van that tracks the flights and provides data to verify the records. It takes those folks about three hours to power up and run their prediction checks.

I try to call Jerry Callender, chief of the RCA radar crew. He has apparently already seen the moon and stars. No answer. I know these people without to know that Jerry is not sleeping elsewhere. Jerry and his crew has gone over. I call the room of Stont. Jim Enggart, our weather balloon team chief No answer. His group is also at work.

Four more phone calls--to Petre Garnsion, chief test pilot for McDonnell Aircraft and the wake of mission control; for 30,000 Huggs, Deputy Project Leader and coordinator of all base support; and to Majis. Dave Peterson and Mac Mac Mariane, the other Air Force Project pilots.

Due will be tightly safety chase today, and Mac will be operating the mobile, content with a radio-equipped start car. With the primary application not working, I am again pleased with myself for insisting that all utility the streak Eagle staff live in the same model. Otherwise, I'm afud we might have missed someone. Except for the radar van and weather balloon functions, we could launch a record attempt in two hours from notification.

That's starting with everyone islase in the model.

A quick breakfast and everyone arrives at work by 80%. The briefing doesn't take long. We have tifted this mission three times before. We again discuss the frequencies, call signs, and who's going to do what.

I will be Eagle in the F-45. Dave will chase in the F-4 with L1. Col. Carl Anderson, the Grand Forks AF Chief of Operations, in the back seat. Carl was selected for his through knowledge of the area and a pair of seven steps to help Dave: reduction the Eagle if the transit level does not provide reasonable visual cost over the top.

Pete Garnsson will run the radar van, be my ground contact, and provide assistance in the event of problems or emergency. Pet had flowm all development times in the streak Eagle F-15 and knows it inside out the primary assistant will be Dick Cahill, the genus McFar (McDonnell Aircraft). Project Engineer who "invented" Project Streak Eagle. Dick built the confirm, flight profiles to achieve maximum altitude in minimum time and can travel through more about what we were doing than anyone in activity.

Dick's/duffing the flight is to monitor fuel remaining, time, and Mach environment advise Pete if we are "go" or if we should abort early and avoid the \(a\).

Kajajoe Higgs will run Eagle Operations and ensure that crash crews, helicgers, and clearness are available on time. Norm Gaddy and Tom Hensler are the McAlar crew chief and chief inspector who will make sure the Eagle is ready to fly. Sets. Art Ball and Riley McVey are the crew chiefs on the F-4 chase aircraft.

Wayne Kupferer, Mo Gardner, and Roger Crane, the National Aeronautic Association observers, will certify and submit the record if we succeed. The team includes about forty other people.

It is 0900 and the briefing is over. A crowd of well-wishers is starting to assemble outside the briefing room. The weather still looks good. The runway has been cleared of snow, and the Fargo weather is excellent. The balloon results are in. Temperature at 30,000 feet is ten degrees below standard and two degrees below standard at 36,000 feet, where final acceleration will occur. The wind is more from the west than the north, but is blowing at eighty knots.

This is a good The aircraft is released by maintenance. Everyone and everything is ready.

My stomach feels as it had in high school, twenty-two years ago when I stood on the goal line waiting for the opening kickoff. The difference is that this time is know the ball will be coming to me and although I have fifty other people to help me, the largest share of any failure will probably be mine. After Monday's attempt, I'm not sure how much more embarrassment the project will tolerate. At a time like this, I don't communicate well with my wife (or anyone else) so I take my flight data to an empty briefing room and lock the door.

### The Flight Profile

The profile haan't changed much since Monday's unsuccessful attempt. Release from the holokback cable at full afterburned with 7,000 pounds of fuel. Gear up and rotate for taxedit at the first indication of airspeed, about seventy knots. Watch the gear unsafe light and hope it goes out by 350 knots. If not, abort fast. Look for 0.65 Mach-about 4200 knots. Rotate vertically into an Immerman and hold 2.65. Except to arrive level usable down at 32,000 feet at 1.1 Mach. Roll 180 degrees to right side up and accelerate to 800 knots. Clim at eight degrees to 36,000 feet at 600 knots. Hold 36,000, accelerate to 2.25, pull four so its fifty-five degrees. (I know it will now take sixty degrees with today's strong tailwind.) Look for four degrees' angle of attack. Hold four degrees until ten Gamma calls to recover (passing the required 98,425 feet). Shut down afterburners when they blow out. Shut down the engines when they quit. At the "recover" call, try to hold zero angle of attack to minimize any tendency for control or gyroscopic unknowns to the flight path in the area atmosphere. Ride ballistically to a fifty-five-degree dive angle. Look for 100 knots airspeed and start turning for home-and you can figure out where home is on the snow-covered terrain without a compass.

At 550,000 feet or below, look for four open lights on the instrument panel to indicate the boost pump is on. Try to start both engines at once when above 350 knots and twelve percent rpm. If at least one starts and you have radio contact with Pete Garison, talk about coming home to Grand Forss, depending on fuel remaining. If there is no start or no contact on radio, think about Fargo or ejection. It sounds complicated but really at the important decisions were made ahead of time. Except one thing: That's the fifty-five-degree climb angle intercepting zero angle of attack at 300 knots. This had degree climb angle intercepting zero angle of attack at 300 knots. This had given us about fifty-five knots of airspeed over the top in the simulator. Ample longitudinal pitch control on Monday when I ended up 2,000 feet short at 96,300 feet.

My boss at Edwards called afterward to assure me of his faith in simulators and me, "But don't go where you haven't been." "Hell, Boss, Ive never been to 103,000, and that's where were got to go to get through 98,400 in a climb."

The chief aerodynamics in St. Louis for McAix has a different idea: "It will take a sixty-degree climb and four degrees: angle of attack to get there in record time."

"What kind of indicated airspeed will we see on top?" I asked. "What kind of pitch control will we have there?"

"Never mild. You need sixty degrees' climb angle and four degrees' angle of attack. You will have at least thirty-five knots over the top, and the aircraft should be controllable."

We have flown more than 4,000 flights in the F-15 with no accidents. I would rate like hell to be the first. But I had a lot of faith in the St. Louis 

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:28]

Pete calls, "Deep Blue," our code word for much better time than expected. "Red" would have indicated no record time or failure to achieve record altitude;"White" a valid record time but not as good as expected, based on computer analysis. We had expected about 226 seconds.

Three more natural attempts finally get the right engine among the living, and the compass and TACAN indicate firm pointed generally in the direction of Grand Forks. Now's its time to waste attitude to get down. The Streak Eagle has no need space, and a descent must be made at a higher-than-normal speed of the aircraft glides forever.

Due exists to tell me he is stucked in in formation, and down we go. Pete calls the record time with a additive we have arranged to make sure we get a chance to discuss the flight before we hear about it on TV. Two hundred and eight seconds-thirty-six seconds of the old record record (50d, Italy). The two to concentrate on landing now. No flybys today. Gear check good, touchdown, and into the barn.

The crowd of expectations has grown, and they all appear to have changenage. Why wife is first up the ladder, and Don Needes is right behind, to help me out of the cockpit. The Eagle has now broken an eight world class time-to-climb records by an average margin of more than twenty-one percent across the board

The people who build her and her engines and the people who maintain and try her have a right to be proud-and they are. The world time-to-climb records are now back in the USA. And life is a beautiful deep blue at forty plus six days.
