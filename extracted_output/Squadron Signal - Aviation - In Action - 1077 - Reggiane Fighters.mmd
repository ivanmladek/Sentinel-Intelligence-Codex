## Introduction

_Officine Mecornic_ (Mechanical Office) 'Reggiane' S.A. was an aircraft production subsidiary of the Caproni industrial group in the northern Italian city of Reggio Emilia. It was one of the many factories controlled by _Counter Megener_ (Engineer) Giamori Corporation, an Italian industrialist and aircraft designer. Caproni had received graduate degrees in Civil Engineering (Motion, Germany), Electrical Engineering (Linge, Belgium), and Aeronautical Engineering (Paris, France) before returning to Italy in 1910. He abolished his first aircraft, the CA-I, that same year and founded the Caproni Aircraft Company and flight school in 1911. After the break of World War one in 1914, the firm turned is attention to heavy bombers, producing over 700 aircraft in several designs over the next four years. The most notable of these bombers was the **CA-33**, which was used - and built in some cases - by the United States, Great Britain, and France. After World War One, Caproni continued to design and produce a number of large aircraft, but by the mid-1930s, these designs no longer pick those of those of other nations. Caproni then turned to the development of light bombers and flights. The Reggiane aircraft production program was originally set up to manufacture American aircraft under license, but this program was changed due to strong influence from Count Caproni. A new plan was soon developed for a fighter based on the Sevensky P.X-T. This aircraft was an all-metal fighter with catheter, semi-vertical wings and stressed skin extinction. The Sevensky P.X-T.X was developed for the US Army Air Corps (SUSAX4) fighter competition of 1934, Sevensky P.X-T.X developed for the new fighter, which first appeared in 1935. The SEV-1XP was accepted into USAC service as the P.38 in 1938.

Engineer Roberto Longh all worked in America before returning to Italy in 1936, but he joined Reggiane. He and Reggiane technical director Antonio Acise developed a new filter for the _Reggia Aramomatica_ (Royal Italian Air Force). Caproni/Reggiane's proposal - the **Re:2000**_Fake_ (Fakon) - was almost identical in appearance to the Sevensky P.35. The I-leg and wing of the P.35 design was changed; however, the copyright interior, India and the engine oil cooler were redesigned. The carbuter air intake was located on the top of the coating. These improvements increased the Re.2000s speed by approximately 243 ms (40 x\(\mathrm{a}\)0) over the P.35, although the Re.2000 used a less powerful engine than the Sevensky aircraft. Wind tunnel testing was carried out at the Caproni facility at Milan-Taliedo.

Reggiane test pilot _Commander_ (Mayor) Mario de Bernart have the Re.2000 prototype, M.M. (_Matorio Millare_, Serial Number) 408 for the first time from Region Emilia in 2014 May 1938. This aircraft was more aeronautically refined than the rival Fatu G.9 and Macchi C.2001, which held prepared in 1937. The all-heat R.000 fighter was proved in 986 horsepower (wr) Flaggio P.XI R.C.40 14-cylinder, air-cooled media engine. A NACA (US National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics) cowling with hydentically powerful copper fans enclosed the engine. The P.X.R.C.40 turned a three-blobe, constant speed, variable pitch of Paggio metal propeller.

The semi-elliptical wing had five guxes for structural strength. The centre-section housed the fed tanks with a capacity of 100 Imperial gallos (120.1 gallos/4544.6) in the forward portion and 35 Imperial gallos (6.6 gallos/409.1) in the direction. The finite-covered. Five-type piercing air-shoue sketched leading one increased those when raised for greater 'bit" were found both statically and aeronautically. The flaps were traditional in construction and operation - a continuous, split type that included a center section under the fuselage. The streamlined, circular sectioned fuselage was flush-fuivered. The unit was of constant tension with friblow-covered control surfaces. The Re.2000 had a wing span of 36 feet 1 inch (13 x), a height of 26 feet 2 inches (79 y), and a height of 10 feet 4 inches (31.5 x). The aircraft weighed 5425.3 pounds (2400 kC0) entry and 742.9 pounds (3240 kC0) fully loaded.

The Re.2000 cockpit had a traditional layout and was completely enclosed by a rearward sliding canopy, which provided good, all-acculability. An mirror plate 0.3 inches (800) thick and weighing 193.4 pounds (80 kC0) was mounted behind the seat to protect the pilot. The aircraft was equipped with a Type B.30 radio and an oxygen system. Provision was also made for a wing-mounted on-camera, but this was only installed by special request.

This fighter - like other contemporary Italian - was armed with two 0.5 inch (12.70m) Beda-SAFAT machine guns. Three weapons were mounted in the upper fuselage in front of the cockpit and fired through the propeller arc. The machine guns could be fired individually or together. Each weapon was fed from 300 round ammunation box contained within the fuselage. Reggiane considered adding two wing mounted machine guns, but this takes was soon dropped. Provision was made to attach two bomb containers on each side of the mid-wing section. Each container could carry two-way two-44 0 Paul (2 kC0), Type 33M anti-exponted bonus. The electrically operated bomb release mechanism allowed the 44 months to be dropped individually or in silsov.

## Re.2000 in Italian Service

In spite of the Air Ministry's rejection of the Re.2000, the _Regia Aeronautica_ (Royal Italian Air Force) expressed some interest in the aircraft for possible naval service and shipboard use. The Re.2000 Series I was eventually cleared for shipboard service with the 1\({}^{\circ}\)_Sunaglia_ East Africa (1st Squadron, Naval Force); however, the aircraft were never used operationally. After the naval engengencies in June 1942, _Regia Aeronautica_ (Royal Italian Navy) had neither the monale nor the technical resources needed to mount additional offensive operations against the British Mediterranean Fleet. Military activities at sea and in the air were limited to the areas around Scily, Sardinia, and the Tyrhjian Sea. Land-based figures and roomiseise measured aircraft developed over all of these areas. By the time of Italy's Armicic with the Allies on September 1943, the 1\({}^{\circ}\)_Squadrigalia_ FF.NN. And only two universecubee 26.000s in its memory.

Apart from the Series I demonstration/prototype (M.M.408), five more Re.2000s Series I has (M.M.506-N.M.507) were accepted with the full length Reelsia's memory. These five air-driven work is at Re.2000 G.A. (_Grande Automotive_, Long-Range) figures, with additional full tanks to extend the range from 522 (840 x) to 807 miles (1298.7 x). This variant was developed to meet the Italian requirement for a long-range fighter, which arose while attempting to seed replacement aircraft to Italian forces in East Africa. Dissassembled Fat CR.42 figures were being allotted to Italian East Africa in specially modified Savoia. Marchetti S.M.822 transorvers, although modern warfare required a fighter to have the ability to

The March C.2000 Sierra was ruled out due to that fighter's short range of 540 miles (869 x). This left the Re.2000 as the only available fighter capable of being given a long ferry range. The first Re.2000 G.A. equipped with extra rental tanks was from Westly test pilot CoI Adriano Matheil with satisfactory results - the fighter remained both easy to fly and maneuverable. Regagine built 24 Re.2000 G.A.s and serves selected for the ferry flights; however, the project ended when British forces captured Italian EstRA in May 1941.

Re.2000 were eventually delivered to the 23\({}^{\circ}\)_Grapo Automotive_ (Independent Group) at Catania, Sicily the spring of 1941. This Group - commanded by Major Inc Inctional - consisted of the 70\({}^{\circ}\)_Matheil_, and 75\({}^{\circ}\)_Squadriglite_ (Squadrons). The Re.2000s and ten CR.42s were assigned to the 74\({}^{\circ}\)_Squadriglite_, while the other two Spaomatous received CR.42s.

A new experimental squadron for performing Re.2000 was formed in Italy during the spring of 1941. This was the _Sefore Spring (Experimental Section) of 23\({}^{\circ}\)_Grapo Automo_, commanded by Capt Pietro Calistri. The Section received six Re.2000 Series I figures for evaluating. Plots familiar with the CR.42s maneuverability and aerobic qualifiers were not to enthusiastic debt Re.2000. The pilots were also readily aware of the Steggio capsules coming, which resulted in the Re.2000s staying grounded for several days. The engine problems were fixed and the Experimental Section soon began its first combat operations, primarily consisting of reconnaissance patrols along the Sicilian coastline. The Section Interlean flying attack missions, using light bombs against British military installations on Malia.

Series 1 aircraft were augmented by nine new Series III (Figures. Both Series II and III Re.2000s were equipped with radios, which were not carried out with Series Icarital. Two compartments, each holding 24.4 (1.2) to 2x0 air-per-sement bonus, were fitted to the fuselone underwater, flanking the oil coulcer. The enlarged 377 _Soundigia_ remained assigned to 23 _Huppe_. Anatomous and was based at Tapani Milit aircraft in Sicily. The Re.2000s of this unit defended Milo and provided air cover for Italian naval forces off the Sicilian coast.

The Spaator took part in numerous reconnaissance and naval resort flights, but did engage middle figures. On 12 February 1942, the Spaator's last Series I machine (IM.30569) was written of At Comiso airfield after a landing accident.

In March of 1942, the 377 _Soundigia_ was relocated to Decoraldizo airfield at Palermo, Sicily and received ten repaired Series II Re.2000s. The Spaator participated in the Battle of Pantelelel in June of 1942, providing air cover for Italian warships attacking the British supply company from Gibilarator to Malta (Operation HARropON). The 377 _Soundigia_ served on kili/s, and no aircraft were lost. On 16 September 1942, the last of the unit's obsolesment Re.2000s were returned to the Regaine factory at Reggio Emilia. Reggiane had built 170 Re.2000s for all customers.

The Re.2000s' instrument panel was painted flat back to reduce glare for the pilot. Primary flight instruments were placed on the upper portion of the instrument panel. The breaches of the two own coupl-mounted 12.7m bus-beda-Saranadine guns flanked the upper instrument cluster, instruments on the lower panel section concerned open-tion of the engine, propylene, and landing gear. The light colored knob on the lower standard operated the oxygen supply for high altitude flights. The quadrant on the cockpit's spot also was equipped with the right-right) throttle, mixture control, and constructor heater here. The cockpit interior was primarily painted a light gray green (approximately FS34258). (Purnka Archib)

## Re.2000 on the Eastern Front

On 5 August 1941, the Hungarian Ministry of Defense sent a two-squarkton Independent Figure Group (IFG) to the Eastern Front. This Group - which consisted of the CR-2-equipped \(2^{\circ}\) and \(24\) Epither Sudrons (FS) - was placed under the comment of the Hungarian Army's Fast Corps. The Fast Corps was submitted to the German Army Group South and Its raw southern against the Soviet Union 9 July 1941. An Re2000 _HIG_ (Havav) with turnoff from the 1/2. FS at Szolnok, Hungary joined the IFG and Hew and the front under the command of Captain Laakli Spaces. On 7 August, the seven figures arrived at Stuyka airfield, 12.4 times (20x 80) south of Virginia, Ukraine.

Three days later, the Squadron was located to Pervornys, monkeys, where they fleve their first operational mission on 11 August 1941. Five _HIG_s served Hungarian Carpetta Cas35 themselves which are listed Nikolovye, The _HIG_s primarily fleve bomber escort missions over the Hungarian sector of the Eastern Front from 1/3 until until 20 October 1941, when they were recalled to Hungary. The first kills by the _HIG_s were on 27 August, when three Hungarian pilots each download a Polishzor1-16 fighter over Uningerropotreps. The Re.2000s did not score any more vivicious during their tour, while three _HIG_s were lost and one damaged on

The Re-2000s two upper fuselage 12.7au Bocha-SAFAT machine gans were replaced with two Hungarian weapons of the same culture on the MAVAG _Hdg_ II. This replacement gun was designed by Freeme Gebauer and built by Damuria. The Gebauer weapon had a firing rate of 1000 rounds per minute and was supplied with a 300-round box magazine in the forward fuselage. The bluiler gun becomes and amm-friend fed systems resulted in the _Hdg_ II having upper fuselage decision bulges.

Thor Takafsky Dew the first upgraded and re-engited _Hdg_ II (V-042) from the Bostakos airfield on 20 April 1942. Plight testing continued at the RHAFs' Experimental Institute at Coperl. These tests resulted in modifications to the throtile controls, control stick, and ulthewel. The RHAF accepted the MAVAG _Hdg_ II for service on 25 September 1942.

MAVAG completed the first production _Hdg_ II in early July of 1942. The factory discovered that 'Herbolded, the Italian front lark' seal, was ineffective at preventing personnel fault leaks. The Galtier engineer flaxaxide immediately designed smaller replacement felt tanks to be installed into the mid-wing. See the aircraft received. The aircraft received 222 tanks, each of 5.3 to 6.6 g/20ms (20 e-25 L). Surprisingly, the replacement status noticeably improved the fighter's stability. Fuel tank and other modifications were completed on the first 25 produced from the 1942 December of 1942.

The IHODOD operated 100 more _Hdg_ II is on 2 September, before the second batch of 75 aircraft began construction. The Tikafsky Dew the first _Hdg_ II (V-47+1) on 30 October 1942. The final aircraft of the initial batch (V-495) equipped test flights by the end of the MAVAG of 1943. The second batch of 75 (Hdg) is the top to V-570 on the MAVAG assembly line when the third batch of 100 _Hdg_ II began production. The generator of 1943. Aircraft of the second batch received codes from V-49 to V-570, with the last aircraft completed on 7 March 1944. The final two aircraft then went more modified for dye-booming. These _Hdg_ II is received underking the brakes, which were powered bybeit electron motors. A drive-booming sight and a centerline bomb rack for either a 551.1 h or a 1102.3 h blown power also filled to these aircraft. A third flight (V-60/00) was larger modified for dye-booming. None of these modified flight (V-61/00) was blocked to have been used operationally.

By early March of 1944, the import of various parts and instruments from foreign sources became increasingly difficult. A British air held hit the WM Aircraft and Engineering factory at Coperl during the evening of 3- April 1944. This attack destroyed most of the warehouses and 95 percent of the spare parts on hand. The Hungarian Ministry of Defense huled production of WNK-14 engines and WM toproellers at the end of April. The WM factory was hit by another end on 27 July 1944, which completely destroyed the engine factory, assembly shop, and warehouse. The factory's destruction ended incomplete the 25 to 30 remaining _Hdg_ II is in the third production batch.

The final _Hdg_ II produced (V-64+87) was test flown on 11 October 1944. Four or five additional aircraft were at Bostakos airfield awaiting flight tests at the end of December of 1944, when Soviet troops approached the facility. Hungarian engineers destroyed these remaining _Hdg_ II is with hand and perhaps before Soviet forces could capture the aircraft. MAVAG produced 203 _Hdg_ II figures for the RHAF.

## Re.2000 in Swedish Service

The Swedish Air Force (_Fly_perperper) ordered the Sorensky EP1-166 - an export version of the P-35 fighter in 1939. The first 60 aircraft arrived during early 1940; however, the US government requested the final 60 EP1-106s before delivery. The Americans also cancelled Sweden's order for 144 Vulter **Sungarload Model 40C** registers.

The Swedish government looked to the Re.2000 - an improved copy of the P-35/EP1 - to replace the undervalued US figures. A contract for 60 Re.2000 was signed on 28 November 1940. This contract was important for the Italian Government, since the siertzs price would cover the importation of sterically valuable chrome and nickel ore from Sweden.

The first Re.2000 arrived in Sweden in 1941. These two aircraft (registration numbers 2303 and 2304) were assembled and then test flow on 18th September, 1941. The 60 Re.2000s (2301-2306) were assigned to the F 10 _Korea_. _Sususus Fygilomijn_ (Figure 1999), stationed at Rulinden and Rinalhay.

The Swedish prices were delighted with the Re.2000 flight characteristics; however, the groundovers were less pleased, due to engine problems and amateur synchronization difficulties. The engines were also had to start in the Swedish winter - a problem that was not noted during testing in Italy.

The Re.2000 as designated 202 (_Gakir_; _Fighter_) in Swedish service. Their high speed and climb rate were useful in interception both Axis and Allied aircraft which entered neutral Swedish airspace throughout World War Two. Most of the 131 US bowners flying to Sweden after suffering heavy damage over Germany went to Rulinden. Among the German aircraft intercepted by the 202s was a stray banked as 1860-11 right fighter (208+NL), which included at Bullinden on October 1944.

The new 202 was lost during a patrol on 3 April 1945, when Erik Nordlund's fighter (Code 31, Nr. 2331) intercepted a German Do24 flying boat over Hanabboken. The 2J0's engine was hit by the DA2+2x Qunton fire. Nordlund attempted to return to his airfield, but was killed when his 20 completed in mid-air.

During the war, 16 Swedish Re.2000 were lost due to pilot error or mechanical problems and 18 others were damaged. The surviving 202s remained in service until 1955. One 2J0 (Nr 2340) is displayed at the Swedish Air Force Museum at Linkoping.

In Re.2000 (2331) was assigned to the F 10 Wing of the _Flyground_ (_Swedish Air Force_) at _Astephohm_, Sweden. The last three digits of the _acreats_ serial number were repeated in large white numbers on the engine coming and the vertical tail surface. The black Wing number 10 was forward of the fuesuesing national rism

# Reggiane Re.2001 _Falco_ II

During the Re.2000 prototype's test flights in 1939, Reggiane engineers began thinking about powering the fighter with the 1175 horsepower (#9) Dainler Benz DB 601 engine. This was a liquid-cooled, 12cylinder, inverted-Vee engine from Germany. The smooth contours of a coiled DB 601 engine promised a fighter with improved aerodynamics over the radial engined Re.2000. The design process began in July of 1939 and the new fighter was officially designed Re.2001. Reggiane unforcedity named in the _Falco_ (Raw) II.

A full set wooden Re.2001 mock-up was completed by August of 1940. In addition to the new engine and reconotured Riesgabe, two underlag radiates were installed to cool the engine. The Re.2003's five-spur site and the troublesome integral field tank were retained. The Re.2001's wingmost of 36 feet inch (11.3) was the same as for the regular Reggiane-er, or the _Falco_ II was 2867 is 3 inches (8.6)3 long and 10 feet + times (3.15 \(\pm\) 0.8 au). The first Re.2001's proof (M.M.409, later M.5387) was completed at Reggie Emilia in the spring of 1940 and first from by factory test pilot Mario de Bernaud in 14 July. Col Puerto Scagnellini completed the factory test flights, then the fighter was delivered to Guidon for stateflight tests. During these tests, several modifications were made in the engine owing and the cooling system. The prototype reached a maximum speed of 352.9 mm (568 xrad) at 18,044.68 (5,500 xrad) and 353.55 (xrad) at 14,763.8 (xrad) at 14,500. This excellent performance is reached in the _Reggia Aeronomic_ (Ro) Itaitai at Force Forceing Zoph 200. Re.2001s. Approximately 550 additional aircraft were to be built under license by Coperth and Broda. The _Reggia Aeronomic_ immediately cancelled Re.2000 production in favor of the new Re.2001.

The Re.2000 prototype (M.M.409) was modified to become the second Re.2001 prototype. A wooden mockup was used to test the Dainler Benz 6014-A engine installation for the Re.2001. This test was conducted in the experimental section of Reggiane's Regg Emilia. Any factory in December of 1939. Engine power monitors endorsed from the five-spurals to support the 12-cylinder, liquid-cooled, inline engine. The Re.2001 prototype first few on 14 July 1940. (May)

**Re.2000 Sliding Canopy**

Re.2001 Folding Canopy

The Re.2001 prototype (I.M.409) was painted Dark Green (F83479) with Light Gray (PS38737) undersurfaces by August of 1940. Technicians have opened the ammunition below for the two fuselage-mounted 12.7mu Bredo-SAFAT machine guns prior to a test flight. The Re.2001's canopy was hinged to starboard and in its center for folding along the fuselage. (Kovies)

Re.2001 Instrument Panel A machine services the battery-operated radio of this Re.2001 (White 10) of the 369s Squaredia, 22\({}^{\circ}\)Argony. This radio allowed pilots to send and receive voice messages. The Group had only four serviceable Re.2001s at Capodoin and Capous airfields on the eve of the Italian Armitisee of 8 September 1943. (Nagy)An R.2001 has just been filled with its engine on the Regalactic production line at Regolo Emilia in late 1941. This aircraft was powered by one 1175 \(\mu\)m Aira Rome R.A. 1000 RC 41-1a - a license-produced B0 6A1.3. The next R.2001 on the assembly line awaits engine installation and is followed by several sets of wings. Another R.2001 with a nearly installed engine sits behind a freshly painted example in the next row. (91GHz)

Regalactic workers apply Dark Green paint on recently complete R.2001s. The controls surfaces - traider, elevators, and elevators - were doped and the white rudder cross was applied before the rest of the airframe was finished. These production Re.2001s were equipped with radio with wire antennas extended from the must behind the canopy to the vertical fin. (91GHz)

Regalactic mechanics prepare an R.2001 (M.M.30755) for a test flight from Regolo Emilia. The table covered control surfaces were doped Dark Green (F534077) with a white rudder cross, while the rest of the aircraft was saturated metal. Flapes on the wing trailing edges were slightly lowered down to a loss of hydraulic pressure. This Re.2001 was later delivered to the 100 "Ongroup (Group). (Novices)

Newt-completed R.2001s are kept up at the Rego Emilia after aftel at Regolo Emilia, near Milan, Italy. The two nearest aircraft were 2001 C.B (Eclectic _Bonnardere_; Figure-Bomben machines. This variant was equipped with a centimble rack for a 2205 B (100 x), a 3827 B (100 x), or a 551.1B (120 x) shown.) Pathological supercharger intake scopes were mounted along the engine covering edges. (91GHz)

**Trone Re.2001** **Falco (Falco)** **I Figures of the 2'.** _Groupe C.T._ are parked in front of their hanger in December of 1941. The two near aircraft were used for flight testing and had their campaign removed. This allowed the pilot to execute the aircraft without having to open the canopy, Italian upper surface camouflos covers extended over the wing and horizontal stabilizer leading edges. Engine radiators were mounted under the wings; the sole Re.2001_bis placed these radiators inside the wings for improved aerodynamic performance. (Within)_The sole Rea2001 Defla (M.A.9920) was equipped with an 840 wc Isotra Fersachli Delta RC 16-46 engines. This engine was a 12-cylinder, air-cooled, inline powerment. The Rea2001 Delta was completed during the summer of 1942 and made its first flight on 12 September 1942. This aircraft reached a top speed of 325 wms (523 nm) - 14 wms (22.5 nm) slower than the standard Rea2001. (Vigna via Tara)

The Isotra Fersachli Delta RC 16-48 engine was a 12-cylinder, inverted Vee inline powerment. This powerment was rated at 840 w at 17,388.5 test (530 nm) and was intended to reduce Italy's dependence on German-built RB 601 engines for the Regia Aeronautics. Figures. The 2001 Delta reached a maximum speed of 325 wms (523 nm) at 18,373 feet (560 nm).

The Delta RC 16-48 engine was air-cooled through an inlet mounted under the propeller spinper. A contributor intake was mounted under the air cooling scope, while no circular intakes flanking the air cooling intake are believed to be spark plug cooling inlets. Exhaustive were vented out the underwater of the cooling. The only Rea2001 Delta was sent to Guidonia, Italy for official tests. It was destroyed when the engine caught for the timing climbing trials on 27 January 1943. The Regia Aeronautics then cancelled an option for 100 production Rea2001 Defla, (Vigna via Tara)(Left) A liquid oxygen bomb was fitted to an Re.2001 (M.M.50754) at the Furbara Experimental Range in Italy on 28 Apr 1953. An R.2002 _Ariete_ another with aropeo was pared beside the Re.2001. The liquid oxygen bomb was believed to be an incondary weapon, which would have used liquid oxygen to increase the combustion of a immobile liquid. This device was demonstrated at Furbara to _Ouce_ (Leader) Benito Mussouli and other digitalities in March of 1943. The weapon failed to explore and the program was abandoned. (UCE)

An Re.2001 (M.M.722) was armed with one S51.1 lb (250 au) high explosive bomb on an undertussage rack. Two pairs of susy braces fitted to the bomb rack prevented lateral (side-by-side) motion of the bomb before release. At least two Re.2001 GVs were used in five-bombing experiments in August of 1942. (Kovices)This Re.2001 CN (Caccia Montram) night fighter (M.M.90760) was originally ordered as a carrier-based fighter; however, delays in Italy's aircraft carrier program changed the aircraft ordered into eight tighters. The night fighter was fitted with two 20km flauser HR 161920 cameras in underting conditions. The Re.2001 CN was in natural mental finish with Dark Green (P343079) control surfaces when it was test flow in March of 1942. (Refing)

Reggiane technicians gather on an Re.2001 CN night fighter at the company's Reggio Emilia at Telfach. Ekanst flame dampers were normally fitted to those aircraft, but not to this Re.2001 CN. A goodside under each wing held a Zuna Muster MG 15/120 camera with 60 rounds of ammunition. The camera were later removed from the Re.2001 CNs, due to the difficulties in obtaining the German-made weapons. (May)

The Re.2001 CN was equipped with engine exhaust flame dampers and a 20m camera mounted in a goodside under each wing. This all-block aircraft (M.M.0076) was assigned to the 150m _Squalifolia_, _Z. Grugno_ at Gorta on 22 February 1943. This wind was later deployed to Sarzanas in northern Italy for night interception missions. Most Re.2001 Cts were used in the daylight ground attack role. (Petroytes)Re.2001 in Italian Service

The _Regia Aeronautics_' first Re.2001 unit was the 2\({}^{\circ}\)_Gruppo_ C.T. (Land-Fighter Group) of the \({}^{\circ}\)_Socuneg_ (Wing). The Groups three squadoms (150x, 152x, and 358y) were commanded by LCaI Giuseppe Baylon and stationed at Revenma. The first Re.2003 were delivered to the Group on 9 September 1941. The three squadoms received 28 Re.2001s by the end of 1941. The 2\({}^{\circ}\)_Gruppo C.T. was deployed to Californe aircraft in Sicily on 10 May 1942. The Group was made the Italian and German air winds that mounted at the ends of the held island of Malta, approximately 5 milles (88.5 x) south of Sicily. The British presence on Malta threatened the supply route from Italy to Axis foresee the British North Africa. The Island also aided the British in protecting supplies for their forces in Egypt. The 2\({}^{\circ}\)_Gruppo C.T.'s R.2001s are the air bundle over Malta on the day arrived in Sicily. On 10 May 1942, the Re.2001s and 4\({}^{\circ}\)_Gruppo_ Mocoll C.2003 except for Cant Z.1007_biv_ bothers sent to bomb a radar installation on Malta. The Italian fighterished with British Supermentir Spiffitere githerts sent to intercept the miders. The Splitters downed a 2.1007_biv_ and a 2 C 202, while damaging two other bombers. The Re.2001s shot down down. Splitters and a Bristol Beaufighter, while changing two more Splitters. The Sicily-based Re.2001s saw much longer cover door throughout 1942, flying with Italian and German bombers sent to naid Malta. These figures helped their own in dogifts with British fibregarding the Island. The notable success of individual Re.2001 jobs included: the two kills coincided to get March on the late afternoon of 12 May. He was seriously wounded during the combat, yet managed to force land his burning fighter since Straicons, Sicily. Muchistic later demed from his injuries. Between 10 May and 18 May, 2\({}^{\circ}\)_Gruppo_ delayed claimed 16 British aircraft that dow down, three doses damaged, and one probably downed. The Italians lost one Re.2001 shot down and three others damaged during this period. Reinforcements for the defenders arrived in Malta on 18 May, when 17 Splitters arrived after launching from the British carrier HMS EAGLE in the western Mediterranean. The Re.2001s of 2\({}^{\circ}\)_Gruppo_ faced the reinforced Spiffiteros on 19 May 1942, when the Italian fighting second is a bombing raid. The bombers were forced to dope their leads and turn back when 20 Splitters broke through the cost. The Re.2001s glues downed to aircraft - a Spiffiter and a Beaufighter - and damaged five other Spiffiteres without loss. The Re.2001s and the C 202s make the 4\({}^{\circ}\)_Gruppo_ began making contiguous ports over Malta on the morning of 24 May. Pilots of 2\({}^{\circ}\)_Gruppo_ had success the net day, when five pilots each channel a British aircraft killed during an escort mission. The British claimed one Re.2001 shot down, although this fighter returned to base.

Intense air enggenerations were fought over Malta between 26 May and 2 June, with the Re.2001s again clashing with Splitters. The Italian pilots claimed five British fibers destroyed and three others damaged during that spun, while losing free.2001s down and three others damaged. On 6 June, air battles east of Malta resulted in three Re.2001s of 2\({}^{\circ}\)_Gruppo_ show down, two others damaged, and one rather missing and uncourcomed for. The Group's pilots claimed two British filters that day.

A more successful mission occurred on 7 June, when nine Re.2001s and 12 MC 202s second-of Italian naval forces stacking Malta, were intercepted British aircraft - three Alhovero topdonbers, a Beaufighter, and spiffites - which attacked the Italian ships. The British lost two Alhores and the Banfighter to the Italian flights, while one Re.2001s was damaged. The Italian tank rose successfully attacked the British covros, resulting in only two of the 17 cmgo ships reaching Malta. The British response to this battle was the suspension of further Malta-bound covros until August of 1942. The actions of the 2\({}^{\circ}\)_Gruppo_ were recognized by Italian Dowe (Lead) Bento Massolin, who personally decorated 15 of the pilots. Eight Re.2001s were awarded the _Mediation of Valitor Aeronautics_ (Silver Medical for Air Vapado, while even others received the _Mediation of Valitor Aeronautics_ (Boone Medal for Air Vapado). The Re.2001s of the 2\({}^{\circ}\)_Gruppo_ continued to primarily escort Axis bunches attacking Malta, although the tightens also accepted. 83.779 period bonded hours sent to attack British covros headed for the Island. This Group was reinforced by the 11 Re.2001s of 2\({}^{\circ}\)_Gruppo_, deployed from Ben-Caiming to Monostica, Sicily on 9 August 1942. These figures were assigned to the Group's 359th and 362nd Squadors. The 54\({}^{\circ}\)_Socuneg_ C.T.'s 26 Re.2001s were sent to airfields in Sicily, southern Italy, and the island of Panhelelia.

The 22\({}^{\circ}\)_Gruppo_ moved its headquarters from Monostica to Calignone at the beginning of September 1942. Two of the Group's squadoms were sent to Pantelleria for convoy escort export export dust prices.

Regagine - concerned about delayed engine delivery - considered redesigning the Re-2002 to use the 1600 m BMW 801 -to-cylinder, air-cooled, radial engine. This repeated aircraft would also employ the original five-year wing design and integral fuel tanks of the earlier Re.2000. The German s Ordered 500 BMW-powered Re.2003s in late 1943. Regagine sent one engine mounting to Germany for this before an Allied bombing mid the Reggec Emilia factory on the night of 7-8 January 1944. This mid clouded the factory and ended further Re.2002 production there; however, Re.2002 production continued an Cuernois Trailedo and Biella plants. Capovich built on Re.2003s in Talable between September of 1943 and September of 1944. The Germans accepted 25 aircraft from this lot and destroyed the 35 remaining Re.2002s before evacuating Talableo in April of 1945. Only _no after_ week in Battle in 1945, they wrote built it Bella (serial numbers 1117 and 1265). The three factories combined to produce 225 Re.2002s.

Approximately 40 Re.2002s were used by the Co-Bellegment Air Force after the Armisica. The aircraft were originally assigned to the 5 "Somove" before being recognized into the _Gruping Tolfferr_ (Dive-Romber Group) in October of 1943. The _Ariel_ five ground attacks mission to support partististis in northern Italy and the Balmas during late 1943 and early 1944. On 29 March 1944, nine Re.2002s attacked an oil refinery and storage tanks near Dubrovskii. Yugoslavia. This was the last major mission flow by the _Ariel_, although a small-scale attack was launched on a higher Saradini, Albania, a few months later. One of the aircraft failed to return from this mission. Nine Co-Bellegment Air Force Re.2002s were lost in action, while other _Ariel_ were unavailable for combat due to mechanical problems.

The 15 remaining Co-Bellegment Re.2002s were transferred to the _Soundrigia_ _Addestranson Caccia_ (Fighter Training School) at Levenne on 15 June 1944. They remained in service until grounded due to their poor mechanical condition within the next few months.

The Re.2005 _Sagilitario_ (Sagilitarius, the Archet) was Reggiane's last fighter. The design team under _hg_. Roberto Longish began to work on the prototype (M.M.494) in 1941, completing the aircraft by December of that year.

The Re.2005 was a single-seil, low-wing monoplane of all metal construction. The fesding and wings employed a dynamic structure with fridge-covered control surfaces. The empty opened to the right. An entirely new three-type-well elliptical wing design bluff four test paths between the ribs. The fighter had onward-extracting main leading gear, replacing the attrition gear of earlier Reggiane filters. The outward-extracting landing gear was tested using a modified Re.2002 (M.M.7327). This landing gear has the gearting gear position good enough handling characteristics. The tail-wheel was both retrended and steerable.

The Sagilitario effect considerably in other areas from its Reggiane (foreumers. The fuselage's shape was exceptionally clean). The inline engine and the streamlined spiner for the Pragging propeller showed off the power and the resilient lifting characteristics of the aircraft. The Re.2005 had a wing of 36 feet 1 inch (11.3 h/s, a length of 286 7.75 inches (7.3 h/s), and a height of 10 feet 4 inches (3.15 h/s).

The first factory test flight by Capt Tullio de Prato took place on 7 May 1942; however, a landing gear failure forced to grade no brake a busets up landing. The Re.2005 suffered its damage and made its 'official' first flight on 0' May. The aircraft's aerodynamic characteristics completely satisfied of the Prag. Only a few minor modifications were made before the Sagilitario was low to Guadion for the official evaluation in July of 1942. This aircraft reached a maximum speed of 421.6 s/m (678.5 s/m) at 22,801.8 s/m for (6950 80). One month later, the Re.2005s armulated witheree completed it Furbana.

The Sagilitario was assumed with the 2004 Master M36 15/20 common, one in each of the wings (each with 200 rounds) and one fitting through the propeller hub (with 150 rounds). Two 12.78uda Breada-SAYT matching were installed in the upper engine cooling, such supplied bit 350 rounds. The Re.2005 was able to carry either an auxiliary fault or a 2,230.6 to (1000 80) both on a central rack under the fesding.

Production.R.2005 were powered by a 145 P/Pitt RA 1080 100 K. Tijne (Typhson). This was the license-built Daimler Benz DB 605A, a 12-cylinder, liquid-cooled, invented-Vee, inline engine.

By the end of 1942, Reggiane received a contract for only three prototypes (M.M.494, M.495, and one non-flying example for static testing). This was done to the successfully completed flight trials of the rival Fit **G-55** and the Menchel **G-205** fibers in April. Reggiane later received an order to 12 core series' pre-production Re.2005s and began the topline-up process for the raw fighter.

The success of the Re.2005 flight trials prompted the _Miniereide_d'erromatics (Italian Air Ministry) to order 18 pre-production and 750 production _Sagilitario_ in February of 1943. The Ministry also considered a follow-up order for 1000 aircraft, with production by Brecha in Milan, Aerfer in Naples, and Captoni in Berggiano.

The Germans showed considerable interest in the Re.2005 and sent a specially-prepared DB 605A engine with a VDM propeller to Reggiane in April of 1943. These items were mated to

Re.2005 in Italian Service

The first Re.2005 _Seginator_ was assigned to the 362\({}^{\circ}\)_Spaudriglia_, 22\({}^{\circ}\)_Gruppo_ at Naples-Capodichino, under the command of Major Vittorio Minguzzi. A further ten 'zero series' [figisters were delivered a short time later. These figures were deployed at the Mente and Guidonia airfields and were operated in the defense of Naples and Rome.

On 28 June 1943, the 22\({}^{\circ}\)_Gruppo_ was sent to Litcoria for radio training. On 10 July, eight _Saginator_ were transferred to Signgenti, Sicily to help defend the island against the impending Allied invasion (Operation [HUSKY]). Four days later, these figures were withdrawn from combat - only two of the Re.2005s were flyable. These two figures were reassigned to the 371\({}^{\circ}\)_Spaudriglia_ at Reggio di Calbris, were they were destroyed in an Allied bombing radio. On 31 July 1943, the 362\({}^{\circ}\)_Spaudriglia_ received in new Re.2005s from the pre-production batch in Capua. The Squadron then began to develop a method forenging Allied bothers. The _Saginator_ would attack the four-generation bombes had-in a sizable angle, blue, blazing away with all five guns. Just short of a collision, the Italian flights would roll onto their bucks and drive sharply away under the bombes, then climb to repeat their attack. Although this attack method was practiced, no aerial victories were reported.

At the time of the Armitine, the 362\({}^{\circ}\)_Spaudriglia_ was based at Capodichino and had only two Re.2005s left - neither of them were flyable. Squadron personnel destroyed these _Saginator_ to prevent them from falling into German hands.
