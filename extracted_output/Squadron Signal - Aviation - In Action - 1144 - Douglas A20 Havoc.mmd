The Douglas A-20 have was one of the most aerodynamically clean aircraft to see service in the Second World War. This A-20-20 was the final culmination of the line and featured a heavy nose armament of six. 30 called machine guns, a rear power operated gun turned and could carry a two bomb lead over 1,000 lines at a top speed of over 300 mph. In addition, its handling characteristics and maneuverfully were well liked by the crews of the various Allied at forces which used. If the Havepe aided a very important role in the eventual fate of the Axis, particularly in the early days of the war. It was undoubtedly one of the finest warplanes used by either side in the course of the war. (JSAF)

Introduction

During the 1930s, the fragile peace which had existed following the First World War gradually gave way to armed conflict in many parts of the world. Japan, using advantage of political interest in China, took over Manchurchia, then invaded China itself to gain new markets and bases for future expansion. Italy did the same in tiny Ethiopia, considering the small backward country in a hill of bomb and shells against a huge but fruitle resistance. Germany, starting from her defeat and the Versailles Peace Treaty, began, under the rule of Adolph Hitter, to return and gently violate the terms of the peace accord. Then in 1936, civil war broke out in Spain, with Italy and Germany providing support for France's Nationships, while the USSR sent aid to the Loyalist movement. All three countries used Spain as a testing ground for their new equipment and painted valuable information which proved extremely useful in modernizing their armed forces.

Unfortunately, the United States chose to ignore these signals in general, feeling that if weeds for not interfere in these events, the country would not become involved. But, as far individuals is in the military and industry realized that such a view placed the country in jeopardy and began making plans to modernize the U.S. military for what they viewed as our eventual participation in a world conflict.

Douglas Atreprint Company was one work for shipted film and in early 1936 began working on an twin engine, private venture project in anticipation of an Army City requirement for a light attack and observation aircraft. Under the capable hands of Jack Northrop and Ed Itheeman, the new aircraft, designated the Model X1, quickly took shape. The new aircraft was powered by two Part & Whitney R985 Wasp _J.e._, arising which were mounted in inches on the shoulder wing. The aircraft was very slim with a nicely landing gear and provision for a pilot and one crewman. The top speed was as expected to be in excess of 250 mph. Provisions were made for it to carry a number of flexible and fixed 30 caliber melting guns, a light bomb load, or as an alternative, a glocal tower mid-section reconnaissance or observation in place of the bomb. Why when the design was approximately fifty fifty percent complete and a mock-up had been built, new information reached Douglas concerning what the Air Corps was looking for, and it was decided to shelve the Model X1 in favor of a completely new design.

The Initial Douglas design which was the foremomer of the A20 bus the Model 7B. The Model 7B evolved out of a paper design, the Model 7A, which was only built as a mock-up. The Model 7B came in two versions which held different noses. The "A", none was solid and could carry six 30 caliber melting guns and two 50 caliber melting guns. The shury factory shaped piece of metal on the fuselage under the cocklist where a blister could be mounted on the glass noesed version to carry.30 caliber machine guns. (McDonnell-Douglas via Merritt)

Based on information coming out of the Spanish Civil War, the Army wanted an aircraft which would have a range of 1.200 miles, fly at 200 mph and carry a 1.200 found bomb load. It then invited companies to submit designs for such an aircraft during the 1937, requiring that they be ready for submission in July of 1938. In January of 1938, Jack Northrop quit Douglas to form his own company and Itheeman along with project engineer, Weidenheimer began work on a revised design, the Model 7B.

Using the Model 7A as a start point, before and upgraded the earlier design, Alternate socio sections were designed, one clear for a bombarbarbarbar and his equipment, and one solid for a battery of six.30 caliber machine guns and two.50 caliber machine guns. These inter-charge passes allowed the design team to do away with the observation station in place of the bomb by, in addition, the clear mode would carry machine guns in "bister" packages on the fuselage on either side of the nose. Negines, 1100 hPa P8. Whitney R985 SX3-G4 radius, were substituted for the original R985s, mostly trip the available horsepower. These were engines allowed the aircraft to carry a 2.000 sound load at anticipated-based rubber than the central Army requirement.

Satisfied with their design, Douglas submitted it to the Army Air Corps. After looking it over, the Army involved Douglas, and the other compelings, Bell (Model 9), Martin (Model 167), Steemann (X-100) and North American (X-40) to build, at their own expense, propes of their designs. Bell declined to participate, but all the others began so that their prototypes in accord to reach a 17 March 1939 deadline.

The B0-77 proposed originally and by the October of 1938, the aircraft was ready for flight testing, On 26 October, the first flight took place, followed by a series of company flight tests. The new design proved to be exceptionally maneuverable, last, and exhibited no serious handling vices. The U.S., however, will vacillated between isolationals and rearming to meet the threats coming out of Europe and Asia, and despite being impressed with the 7B, nothing concrete was done by the government toward acquiring the aircraft.

While all this was going on, a French purchasing Commission was touring various U.S. aviation companies looking for new existing designs to purchase the Armbe of A fair Air order to match the expanding aerial night of the new German Lunktraffer. Informed about the new Douglas design, members of the commission were able to obtain permission to witness performance trials, although this was work secret in order not to raise any diplomatic problems or give the isolationless forces more fuel for their fire. Impressed with what they saw, the Comber Model 7B, nose was glass enclosed and could carry a bombardment and the needed rule of two.30 caliber machine guns. The machine gun blister below the cocktail Corpus marbles and crashed in January of 1939, with a French observer aboard. This caused quite a political stir since at the time the U.S. was still officially neutral. (McDonnell-Douglas via Merritt)mission asked for, and received permission to participate in the flight tests. As a result, throughout December of 1938 and into January of 1939, various members of the commission took prior in flight tests, again this being kept secret. Unfortunately, during one such test on 23 January, to show of the aircraft's single engine handling characteristics, an engine failure resulted in the 78 gung into a tight spin at low altitude. The Douglas test pilot, John C. Able, was able to roll out, but his parcunee only partially opened and he died on impact with the ground. The French observer, Captain Maurice Chemath, wrapped in the spinning aircraft, survived the crash, although with serious injuries. Spectacularly ruled to the scene and carried out of the Frenchman on a makschild stretcher made from the remains of the vertical tail section. The media, however, soon discovered the presence of a foreign observer on the aircraft, and soon the cry cry event up from the isolational forces. General Henry "Hug" Arnold, for the fourth of this controversy and for nearly a year, he was under constant scrutiny by isolational officials in Washington.

While the crash of the prototype was a serious setback, the French, despernied in need of modern aircraft, placed an order for 100 aircraft, which was later increased to 270. The French requested that certain changes be made, including an increase in the aircraft's range and payload, additional mirror, and French instruments and weapons. These requests, coupled with flight data, made Heineman approach Donald Douglas about the possibility of revising the design in order to improve it. Using finally accepted to his request and work began on the revision, designated the DB-7, for Douglas, Bomber. Seven.

The first major redesign was in the fuseluge which was narrowed and deepened which lowered viny resistance and allowed more fuel to be carried. Unfortunately, this did not allow the crew to change places in the air, and if the pilot was severely injured or killed, neither the botherner of gun gun could take over the controls. To alleviate this, as second set of controls was fitted to the guners station with limited instrumentation to provide some chance of making it back to base. These were of such limited value, that on later models they were eliminated. In place of interunangle those sections, a compromise was reached with a series of clear panels and a glass force for the bombardment and four fixed machine guns fitted slightly behind and below the nose. Right behind the trailing edge of the wing, the top of the fuseluge diped down to form a gunners within which was covered with a sliding glass canopy and fitted with a single machine gun. Below that was fitted a ventral gun position also fitted with a single machine gun, all armament on the aircraft being French 7.5MM Chatelemault machine guns.

With this revision of the fuseluge, the wings were mounted near the middle of the fuseluge rather than a shoulder position. In order that the landing gear not become extremely long, the engine meckes were moved to a underswelling position on the wing. The nose wheel leg, however, of fixed to be heightened to compensate for the additional height of the fuseluge off the ground. A slightly different engine, the Pratt & Whitney R-1830-S3-G replaced the earlier "TB" Boy plant and the mecelies were enlarged to handle the new mount and slightly revised landing gear.

By mid-August of 1939, the DB-7 was ready for flight and production was soon underway at the Douglas El Seymour, California plant. The first production DB-7-rolled of the assembly line in October and the French ordered an additional 170 aircraft in the same month. These were to be equipped with the more powerful Pratt & Whitney R-1830-S3C4-G radial fitted with a two stage supercharger. Due to engine shortages, these were not readily available, and the French, despernied for aircraft, agreed to allow Douglas to use the older engines to keep the production line open.

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:7]

## DB-7A

While the French were pleased with the initial performance of the DB-7, they also wanted to see if its overall performance could be improved with more powerful engines. As a result, a third order for 100 aircraft was given to Douglas for aircraft fitted with different engines. The engine specified was the 1,600 by Wright R-260-A5B radial. These were export models of those being used for one of the American versions of the DB-7, the A-20A. The only significant change in the overall design was in the needed all unit area. Due to the size of the new engines, the nacules were lengthened, which resulted in a more compact appearance compared to the shorter, rather DD-7a.ectile. Cooling steps were also added to the confusing and the intakes and estuaries were also redesigned. The increased power of the Wright engines caused serious concerns about directional stability, control and structural integrity. In order to compensate for this, the vertical fan and rouder were increased in size and additional internal strengthening was added to the tail area. Another solution that was tested was twin tail surfaces, which were fitted to two aircraft to see if control and stability could be improved. It was also tried to see if the twin tail arrangement would allow a better field of fire for the rear pointer. After some testing, it was found that the twin tails offered to significant benefits and the aircraft were converted back to standard single oil configuration.

Two other marine changes also took place. A new landing gear was substituted in place of the original design due to a better design and to ease maintenance. A fixed machine gun was also mounted in the fit section of each engine kinetic for rear defense. Later, tests with these, showed that they were of little value and were rarely, if ever fitted.

Eventually, the French were to place a series of orders for this new variant, designated the DB-7b, but very few of the aircraft ordered reached France prior to the fall in the spring of 1940. The bulk of the order was diverted to the British where the aircraft were designated as the Boston. Roman numerists were used to differentiate the various types with the DB-7s becoming Boston Is or ILs, while the DB-7a received no Boston designation.

## DB-7B

The British, like the French, were in desperate need of modern aircraft to match the night of Hitter's Ludwig. The new Douglas aircraft caught the attention of the British purchasing Commission, which, like its French counterpart was storing various aircraft manufactures. While ingressed with the DB-7, they required about having certain changes made in the DB-7A a being built for the French, which would make it suitable for British service. The only major outward change was arangement of the nose transparency so that instead of a stepped arrangement, the glass would go back on a diagonale which would improve visibility. They also wanted British weapons and instruments fitted to the aircraft. While the change in instrumentation was easy, problems arose with changing the weapons in the nose. It was found that the British machine runs would not fit inside the fuselow and so a terapdofizing was used to cover them, resulting in little outside dog. Satisfied with these changes, the British ordered 150 aircraft in February of 1940 and another 150 in April. These aircraft were designated as DB-7B and were very similar in overall appearance to U.S. Army Air Corps A-20a and A-20A-20A-20A.

The French also placed in order for this type under the designation DB-73, apparently so numbered as not to confuse their aircraft with the British DB-7B. These aircraft were equipped with French instruments and weapons, but with the fall of France, none were ever delivered.

The British decided to name the Douglas bombet the Boston and used Roman numerals to designate different models. The DB-7B became the Boston III as the British had clear over earlier French aircraft orders which became Boston Is and I'll. Some of the Boston IIIs were fitted with special flame dampers over the exhausts and equipped with a ventral gun pack under the fuselog containing four 20nat camon. Aircraft which were so modified were designated as Boston III traders.

**British interest in the DB-7 series resulted in an order for a version similar to the DB-7A but with a different type of nose, British weapons and instrument arrangement. The new nose made the aircraft slightly longer, but otherwise the aircraft was externally identical to the French model. (McDonnell Douglas via Merritt)**A-20

While the French were the first to place an order for the new Douglas design, the U.S. Army Air Corps had finally decided that the basic BT-7.65ugs been met their 1938 specification for an attack aircraft. As a result, the Army placed an order for the aircraft in June of 1939. Certain changes were specified for the U. S. variant, including more powerful engines and some of these were to be equipped with unobservaterizers. Those fitted with the supercharges were to be designated as A-20s and these roughly corresponded to the D8-78. The aircraft were powered by Wright & 2600-7 engines, but the supercharger installation was extremely bulky and problems arose within. As a result, the Army decided to drop the supercharger, since the mission of the aircraft would be low-level attack, which did not require light altitude performance.

Safety-three A-20s were ordered and all but three of these were eventually converted to night fighters, one serving as the prototype XP-70 and the remainder as P-70s. These were fitted with the British AM IV relay in the nose and four 200MM common were fitted in a ventral back under the fuselage. The remaining three were initially converted as photo-recomissance aircraft under the designation XR-3 (one and YY-3 (two), which were later used to test various summer configurations, All of these were fitted with autospherherized Wright & 2600-71 engines for better altitude performance.

The remaining three A-20s were converted to F-3 photo reconnaissance aircraft and used for a variety of jobs and experiments. The last of these was assigned to the 2nd Reconnaissance Squadron at Ladd Field in Alaska during August of 1942. (USAF)

11 engines for better altitude performance.

A-20A

The A-20A was very similar to the A-20 except for the bulky turbospurecharger. They were fitted with a slightly less powerful engine, the Wright R-2600-3, which produced some 1,600 hp. This engine was similar to those used on the French DB-7A and British DB-7B (Boston III). Outwardly there was little to differentiate the Boston III and A-20A. Early aircraft had cooling vents along the sides of the engine owing like the DB-7A, but these were later defect-ed as they proved to be of little use. Machine guns could be mounted alongside the nose in the teratopo shaped flairings and at firing nancing guns could be fitted in the engine inchelves, but these were rarely actually installed. A single or twin machine gun could be fitted in the gun-ers were compartment and a single ventral span was installed for downward defense.

Production of the A-20 began during late 1940, and the first aircraft off the assembling line rolled out in December of that year. The initial order of 123 aircraft was later increased by and additional twenty aircraft, these being fitted with the more powerful Wright R2600-11 engines, although to disorientation change was made.

One A-20A was also used for a short time under leaky the US. Navy which needed a high speed utility aircraft to two targets at realistic speeds for aerial gunery. Designated the BD-1, the Navy was very impressed with the aircraft and asked the Army's traditional aircraft could be obtained. Unfortunately, all the aircraft were already assigned, but the Army suggested that some aircraft could be diverted from the A-20B contract if the Navy was intersected. It was, and eventually a number of these aircraft, designated BD-2s, were assigned to Marine Corps utility units.

**The A-20A was almost identical to the A-20 except for the lack of turbospurechargers on the engine machetics. This was the first model of the series to see service in the attack role and was nearly indistinguishable from the DB-7B. (HotCompenik-Douglas via Merritt)**A-20b

In general appearance the A-20B bore a very close resemblance to the DB-7A with the stepped glass arrangement in the nose. Powered by Wright RR2001-1 engines, the A-20B was the first of the series to also use 50 calther machine spins in the nose and in the top quarter's position. It could also carry the aff mounted machine spins in the engine maeles (although these were pretty fired). The bomb by was also modified for better bomb carrying and pro-voters were made for mounting a 200 gallo satiluriety fuel tank in the bomb by for extended ferry range.

This version was the first for which the Army Air Corps placed a large order, 999 being contracted for in October of 1940. In addition, a reconnaissance version, the O-53, was also called for 1,4,189 being ordered at the same time as the A-20B-sheets. The central were to be identical to the A-20B except for the provision for reconnaissance equipment. It was eventually realized that other aircraft were better suited for the reconnaissance mission and no O-53s were actually built. To handle the anticipated orders, Douglas geared up its Long Beach facility and AI-2008 were built there.

The A-20B-however, did not see extensive service in the USACA, as the majority of the order, some of 565 aircraft, were sent to Russia under the Land-Leg Appearance. This decision was due to two main deficiencies in the design, the lack of self scaling fuel tanks and poor armor protection. These deficiencies come to light based on count reports filtered block from the battlefields in Europe and Asia. An additional eight aircraft were also transferred to the Navy for these as high speed target towers, under the designation BD-2.

There was also an X-20B, but this was an A-20A which was modified in mid-1941 with three General Electric gun tunes. These were fitted in the nose and in the dorsal and ventral positions. Power operated, these tunes were equipped with 30 calther machine spins, but tests with the arrangement did not prove successful. Work on this project stopped hot it appears that the aircraft was later used to test a 37nd cammon, which was mounted in the nose, under the designation A-20F. This aircraft was fitted with General Electric remote control tunes in the dorsal and ventral positions, each named with 50 calther machine spins.

**Eight A-20Bs were turned over to the Navy for use as high speed target towing aircraft. These were operated by the Marine Corps and received the designation DB-2**A-20C

In an attempt to standardize production and to benefit from field reports, the A-20C was introduced on the production line during early 1941. The aircraft was powered by Wright R-200-22 engines instead of the earlier R-2600-307-11 versions and self-ealing fuel tanks and additional narrow was added. The extra weight resulted in a slight drop in top speed from 350 mph on a 2-A020 to 342 mph for the A-20C. This was not considered significant in view of the increased survivability which the new features gave the aircraft.

The British B-TB flow is over close resemblance to the A-20C and was given the design-to Section III or III. Aircraft built for the British were constructed by Boeing and different from the Douglas aircraft in their electrical systems, at intake layout and exhaust stacks.

The A-20C reverted to the two aremergament of the A-20A instead of the stepped lay-at the out of the A-20A. The familiar are dopped ships where used to add an additional gun on the nose and the impractical nactile machine guns were finally deleted. The rear guner's ruin front was retained as was the ventral gun position. While U.S. aircraft were fired with 3.00 caliber machine guns, the British versions were armed with 3.03 inch weapons. Provisions were more for some of these aircraft to be fitted with shackles under the fuselage for carrying a standard Navy prepotech, but as far as is known, this feature was only used operationally by the Russians. Late production A-20C also were fitted with an extra fool tank in the bomb by which instilled the bottel capacity of 5049 planes.

Production of the A-20C was carried out at the Douglas Santa Monitor plant where 808 were manufactured and, under contract by Boeing at its Seattle facility, where under 140 were turned out. A large part of the British over has later devoted to the USISME model.Leke and some of the British order was taken over by the USAAC following the attack on Pearl Harbor, when U.S. forces were found to be grossly under strength in modern aircraft. In American service, the A-20C was used primarily as a trainer and test aircraft. Various arrangement and target arrangements were tried, along with various other unusual configurations, including at least one which was used to test an aircraft's ability to withstand fangible bullets when used as a gummy target.

One of the more interesting variations of the A-20C was this aircraft which was modified to test the use of tangible bullets in journey practice. The entire top tweeting from the cockp back to the journey's areas was removed and covered over. The center section of the tuebing, wings, and engine area was then covered with armor to withstand the fran-gible bullets. At/Force Museum)

The cockpit area was heavily plated with armor and special glass was used to protect the pilot. Entry was gained through to map small pitch opened to the right. Other than the actual modification, very little else is known about the project. (Air Force Museum)A-20D/E/F

The A-20D was a projected lightweight version of the A-20B with more powerful R-200-7 engines fitted with turbospowerages. In addition, larger fuel tanks were added, but these were not of the self-scaling type and were a definite hazard in a combat situation. It is not known if this project ever got beyond the design usage, particularly since the turbospower-charged A-20A was such a failure.

The A-20E design was given to A-20A airframes which were lightened, and used for training and various experimental projects. It is believed that many of these were the late pro- and/or R200-11 engines.

The single A-20F was an A-20A flow fitted with upper and lower General Electric remote control times in the rear and a single 37Mcm in the nose. This may have been the same as A-20A which had been designated as the XA-20B and fitted with three remote controlled turrents, one in the nose, dorsal and ventral positions, although this has not yet been confirmed. Data from these tests may have been used in development of remote control turres for the A-20B and 28-29 projects.

**(Right) This A-20A was fitted with a pair of remote control pump turres and a 37mteannon in the nose under the designation A-20F. Although the aircraft was never used operationally, it did provide valuable information for inter projects under development at Douglas. (Air Force Museum)**

This Huroe possibly the same aircraft with the upper turret removed. This Huroe may have been the same aircraft which was initially designated the XA-20B, prior to the introduction of the actual A-20B series. (Air Force museum)

A-20h/a-20k

Late in the production run of the A-206, more powerful Wright R2300-29 engines were substituted for the R2300-23 which increased takeoff and emergency power slightly. To differentiate these more powerful models from the A-206 they were designated as the A-20H. A similar engine change for the glass model A-20I resulted in the A-20K. Eventually, 412 A-20H and 413 A-20K were produced, these being the last flavors to come off the production line. Aside from the engine change, there was no other noticeable changes to distinguish these from the earlier A-206 and A-201. A large number of these late production aircraft were applied under Lend-Lease for the RAF and Russia, including ninery A-20K's taken on charge by the British.

The A-20kK models were basically up-engineed versions of the A-206A, There was no significant external difference to distinguish the versions from one another. This particular aircraft was also related to be preserved after the Second World War, but it eventually was disposed off. The Air Force museum was subsequently forced to look for one and finally managed to find one which had been converted for civilian use. (Air Force Museum)

Perhaps the most unusual experiment carried out with the A-20h/K was this special landing gear whilst was fitted to see IT it would improve the aircraft's ground handling performance in mud, and and snow. (USAF)

P-70 Nishthaw

The need for a night fighter prompted the Army to modify one of the initial A-20s to this role as the XP-70. A British AM M5 IV radar unit was placed in the nose and a ventral tiny containing motor 2004 camera was fitted under the bomb buy as forward firing armament. The radar operator and his equipment were placed in the rear gumens compartment. While the design was not exactly what the Army was looking for, particularly with regard to rate of the attitude and attitude performance, it was all that was available at the time and fifty-nine additional A-20s were modified as P-70 Nightships (although this official name was rarely used), except with Wright & Zep0011 engines, the majority of these aircraft were used for stusteaking, although a few saw service with the fish Night System Squadron in the South Pacific. The next eight flighter warrant was the P-70A-1, which was basically an A-20C which carries its radar in the bomb bar and rear gumens compartment. All the armaran was in the nose and consisted of four 200M cammon and two 50 caliber machine guns, which were used to sight the cameras. The P-70A-1s were equipped with Wright & Zep00-23 engines, and thirty-nine were eventually built, most being used as strangers. Some P-70s was also converted to this time in the field.

The P-70A-70A was also an early A-20G without the rear power curret. Like the A-1, it carried the radar unit in the bomb by and gumens compartment, although the original hand held machine guns was retained. All armaran was in the nose, consisting of six 50 caliber machine guns. A total of sixty-five aircraft were built, but where this number includes seven, which were converted at Brisbane, Australia by the 419th NFS, is unknown. The majority of the A-2s, like the A-1s, were used in training. where either their instrument or radar was removed. A small number saw were in the Pacific with the 60NFS.

The final variant of the series was the P-70B, which was also broken into the P-70B-1 and P-70B-2 variants. The P-70B-1 was a single A-20C-10 which carried an American SCC-720 radar unit in place of the British one. The SC-720 was mounted in the nose and the air-cant carried is ramament in blisters on each side of the fuselage below the cockpit. Each blister contained three 50 caliber machine guns.

The P-70B-2s were either called A-20s or A-20s that were converted to the night fighter configuration and equipped with either the SCR-720 or SCR-729 radur sets. Some retained their rear gun tunes, whose head positions for ten BITS and some had a similar nose to the P-70B-1. Many were identical in appearance to P-70A-2s, which made recognition more difficult. Eventually, 105 were modified as P-70B-2s and most, if not all, serve as in training units. In the training role, both the P-70A and P-70B were sometimes referred to as T-70A-70B-1, but whether was an official designation or not is unknown.

The only P-70B-1 was an A-200-10 fitted with an American SCR-720 centimeter radar housed in blisters along the fuselage slots below the cockpit. (Air Force Museum)The second P-70 in flight with the ventral carbon try installed under the fusetage. This tiny contained four 2020 canon and their ammunition supply.

## 6. Conclusion

The research was the first to take the DB-7 into combat. Following the declaration of war against Germany in September of 1939, the new aircraft slowly reached French hands, and despite the urgency of the time, only sixty-four were in squadron service when the Germans launched their massive attack through the Adreines in May of 1940. These were committed piecemcal in a sun attempt to stop the German Blitzkridge, but to no avail.

While the DB-7s of a deadline job, intense ground free and fighter attacks downed at least eight aircraft and just prior to the end of hostillities all servicable aircraft were flown out of France to North Africa, where they formed the nucleus for roof light without pseudorapears in Algeria and Morocco. When the British attacked the French French French French French French French from falling into German hands, DB-7s from GB 1/32 carried out a ventilatory strike against Gibarkin, but did no damage and suffered no losses.

A large portion of the French order had yet to be delivered, and an agreement was reached between the British and French Purchabians Commissions in the United States to divert the remaining aircraft of the French order to England (this included some aircraft which were later of Belgium from the French order). These French aircraft began arriving before the DB-7s, which the British had ordered, and were placed in service as night fighters and intrudes under the name Havove, since the British felt that these early variants were unsulted for use as day bombers.

In both roles, the modified DB-7s performed well. As further aircraft they carried out low

level missions against German air buses and lines of communications in France. The noted American writer and war correspondent, Quentin Reynolds, even when along on one mission to bomb the Le Bourge airport at Paris and wrote about it in his book on the Battle of Britain. Such attacks caused confusion at German air buses and undoubtedly caused numerous problems for returning German bomber curves all out of proportion to the members of RA aircraft actually involved. As night fighters, the Havove were used as both fighters and Turbhiline aircraft. The Turbhiline worked with a pair of Hurnicenes as a Hunter/Killer team with the Turbhiline aircraft illuminating the targets for the Hurnicenes after it found them via radar. The weight night fighter did fairly well, but the Turbhiline aircraft were not very effective and as newer night fighters, such as the Beaufighter and Mosquito came into service, they were gradually replaced.

Late in the Summer of 1941, British ordered DB-7bs began arriving in England and these were used to replace the Bristol Blitzkheim, which had equipped the light bomber units. Their first major action was in early 1942, when they took part in attacks on the German washing SCHARNHOST, PRINZ EUGEN and GNERSENAU, when they made their famous channel death during Operation CERBERIS. Following this they began to carry out low level daylight operations against German targets in France and the Low Countries. Operating with heavy escorts, they tried to entice the German fighters to come up to stat the Splitrics could engagethem. While not completely successful, the Bostons proved to be very capable bombers and were able to halve numerous his and still return to base. Their rugged construction and ability to return to base with heavy damage endered them to their crews and they were one of the more effective aircraft that the RAF employed in the low level offensive role.

While the Boston was making a name for itself in Europe, a small number were sent to North Africa. Initially that for reconnaissance, they suffered numerous losses until it was decided to use them in their intended role. Unfortunately, the small number available were often committed without fighter support and suffered severe losses. Eventually, enough aircraft were available to equip up South African squaders, which played a major part in hindering Romanel's victorious advance after the British defeats at Gazala and Tokub. They helped give the British the breathing room they needed to allow the Eighth Army to set up a defensive line at EI Alamen. Stopped at this line, the Africa Corpus was forced to go on the defensive and the Boston squadrons provided excellent ground support throughout the Vibryn French aircraft. (Cmy)

Summer of 1942. When Ronnnel was finally forced to retreat, they did much to hinder his withdrawal by carrying out attacks against his vehicles, supply points and lines of communication. Eventually, when German forces were corrected in Tunisia, the Bostons kept up a constant rain of bombs on enemy troops, tanks and defensive positions until the final circulation of all Axis forces in May of 1943.

The first combat sorties for the A-20 in American service was at Pearl Harbor, where a number were damaged or destroyed in the surprise attack on 7 December 1941. As the Japanese made their way down through the Pacific, no A-20s were able to get into the air against them. A few rugged shiped to the Dutch A/na, but only one got into the air before the islands felt and at least one was assembled and tested by the Japanese. By the Summer of 1942 despite victories at the Coral Sea and Midway, Allied forces were inoperative starts and short of aircraft. A few A-20s finally arrived for use by the Both Boston Squadron, 3rd Bomb Group. Under the guidance of the kagumbary Major Paul "Pappy" Gunn, these aircraft were modified to carry four.50 deliver machine guns in the nose and were used for low level strikes on Japanese ships and airfields. These aircraft the first "pushing", a development that rev-dominated aerial warfare in the South Pacific. Using another new weapon, the petawing a small bomb with a parachute attached to slow its decent) - A-20s carried out devastating attacks against the Japanese and helped stop their advance. In conjunction with B-25 Mitchell, panships and Royal Australian Art Force Bosons and Beaufighters, the A-20s of the 3rd Bomb Group annihilated a Japanese convroy in the Battle of the Bismrack Sea. This victory effectively broke the back of Japanese sea power in the area.

In Europe, the first American mission against the Germans was flown in a British Boston. A number of other missions were flown in the same manner. American crews in British aircraft. The first sizable commitment of A-20s under American control, occurred following Operation TORCH, the Allied invasion of North Africa in November of 1942. It was during the initial phases of this operation that a number of Vibryn French DB-7s were destroyed by U.S. Navy FAF Wilders before French forces warmedmedmed. Once the Aliles had gained control of the airstrips, A-20s were flown in and overlude identical support to U.S. and British ground units, particularly during the Kasnerine Pass defeat. Their potped laved the day and eventually the Germans were forced back into a small perimeter in Tunisia, where they warmedmed in May of 1943. Following this victory, the A-20s were lost so often up. Suchily and Italy as the Aliles established a toe-hold on the European mainland. Due to the nature of the campaign which followed, the single U.S. A-20 unit, the 4fth Bomb Group, was used to strike German and Italian supply routes and front-line defenses. They also did experimental work with radar directed bombing until replaced by another Douglas aircraft, the A-26 Invader.

While the war in North Africa and Italy had been going on, plans were made to build up a tactical air force for the invasion of Europe. Three A-20 Bomb Groups, the 40th, 40th, and 416th were assigned to the 9th Air Force to prepare the way for the invasion forces. Due to the heavy German ground fire, low level attacks against fixed targets were halted and the attacks now took place at medium level. At low level the dense flag led to prohibitive losses among the A-20 units. Using glass nosed A-20s and A-20sks is leaf-signy, flights of solid nosed A-20Gs and A-20Hs would attack targets, releasing their bombs on command from the lead-ship. Other missions against road traffic were less dangerous and by D-Dary, the Germans were unable to effectively move during daylight hours due to Allied bombing. When the Allied forces finally established  themselves authors and began to move inland, the A-20 groups provided close tactical support, especially to General George S. Patton's 3rd

The Germans; however, were not yet defeated, and in December of 1944, Hiller unleashed a powerful Paster array through the Andreas Forest, just as he had done in May of 1940 against the French. This area, \(\sim\)20-were used to settle at the German forces, and they carried out massive, concentrated attacks and, as American ground units regrouped and held their ground, the German attack filtered, the felt apart as the Allied forces struck back along the flasks of the attack. By January, the Germans were in full full retreevant contrast assault assault. By now, the A-208 were being replaced by the newer A-26 broader, although a shorter gissanked A-208 kept a number of glass wood A-208 in service a while longer. The \(4100\)th Bomb Group remained their Haveces for night bombing missions and they were the last unit to cover to the A-26, doing so in the Spring of 1945, just prior to the end of the war.

In the Pacific, the Japanese expansion had been stopped and slowly the Allies built up strength. Newer A-2008 began to arrive and, not only did they replace older A-20s with the 3rd Bomb Group, they were used to equip two additional units, the 312h and 417th BombGroups, which were used as low level attack units.

Starting in New Guinea, the Allies slowly moved from there up toward the Philippines, after by-passing Japanese bases that were left to either and die due to a lack of resupply. At low level the A-20s were uneducable, Japanese airfields and ships were hit withty by the low fly-ing aircraft before the Japanese land time to react. Their heavy firepower, maneuverability, speed and bomb load made them the ideal weapon for pinpoint strikes against aircraft, hangers and supply changes. In formation, their forward firepower could overwhelm highboard anti-sircraft weapons and at low level they could skip their bombos into the sides of transports and destroys with deadly occurnes. On a number of occasions, entire Japanese convoys were left-enily wiped out when a 20-20 formations attacked them using skip bombing tactics. Once the Philippines were successfully secured in late 1944 and early 1945, the A-20s switched their targets to the island of Farrone, where there were many Japanese factories producing much needed water equipment. Against determined air and ground defenses, the A-20 groups hit these targets with pinpoint accuracy, seriously correlating the island's contribution to the Japanese war effort. By the summer of 1945, Allied forces were getting up for the transition of Japan and come of the A-20s unste in the process of re-equiguing with the A-20. These plans came to a halt with the Atomic bomb attacks and a 20-A0 mulsu foodown.

Finding end of bottles, a few A-20s were kept for misclinedaneous studies for a short time, but most of the A-20s were declared for warups and melted down for scrap. The replacement for the A-20-A0-A26 transfer, culled into these letters directly back to the A-20.

While the A-20 gained frame for its attack and bombing roles, it also served as the Army's first night fighter in the Southwest Pacific as the F-70-Tournournier, the P-70-N really got stuck for the role, but at the time, it was only at U.S. aircraft able to perform a shift fighter. It was used by four units with various degrees of success over New Guinea and the Solomans against Japanese right magnets. Besides operating a strictly night flighters, they also have night diameter missions and provided cover for PT bouts against Japanese foot planes.

As American production paved up, standard U.S. models began to appear in British serac-Usec. These A-20-A0s are being puerried prior to a mission in support of the British 6th Army. Two Rx4 sequences of A-20-A0 (Station 18) provided invaluable ground support to British ground units and caused tremendous losses to German motor transportation units.

British service the D-7 was named the Boston. It was used for a variety of roles over occupied Europe and also saw service with a number of Commonwealth air forces. This Boston lives asking from 12 or 20 as Squadron, South African Air Force, which supported British ground forces against Romaners's Africa Corps.

Perhaps their biggest accomplishment; however, was that they were used to train hundreds of pilots and radar operation by named the later P-61 Black Widow, the first U.S. aircraft designed from the outset to be a night fighter.

Throughout the war the A-20- was used by nearly every Allied air force in every theater of operations. They fought along side U.S. units in Europe, and included every type in producing, including some original French D-7s, with sure used to bomb-by-passed German pockets in southern France.

In the Pacific, Australian Bottons here wing-to-wing with American A-20 Havecs against Japanese forces and one Amestic Boston named "She's Apples" is believed to have set a record of 186 missions during first service career. It was the Russian; however, who used the most A-20s, receiving nearly half of the total production under Land-Lease. These were used in every conceivable ride, from low level starhers, to torped bombs. Nearly all the early A-20s with their four 200M cannamentament, were set to Russia and these were used for tactical support of armored units. Some A-20s had their rear gun tursets replaced by a Russian unit, which gave the aircraft a rather unusual profile compared to the standard A-20. Many of the aircraft were fertilized to Russia via fan or Alaska rather than taking a chance on sending them via sea, where a number had been lost to German U-boards. Despite the wide-spread use, little has appeared about the A-20 in Russian service and when the war ended, they were quickly phased out of service.

In the Pacific the Japanese sneak attack caught the U.S. and Allied forces off guard and inflicted numerous overseas before the area began to stabilize in midstate 1942.

While the raw was going on in the Pacific, U.S. forces were also getting into the water in Europe. This A-208 prepares to take off for a mission against Geam targets in France during 1943. Combet experience with the A-208 showed that the aircraft did not have the needed protection to survive in an intense aerial combat situation and it was quickly taken out of combat service. (Gilmer)

It is believed that this A-208 was found by the 67th Tactical Reconnaissance Group. The aircraft was based at Itsley Air base during 1943. (Gilmer)
