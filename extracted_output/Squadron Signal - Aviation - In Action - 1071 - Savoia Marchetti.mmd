## Introduction

The Societa Idrovicant Alta Italia (SIAI), located north of Milan at Sesto Calenade, was one of the most successful Italian aircraft manufacturers between World War One and World War Two. The sealing designs of chief designer Alessandra Marchetti, carrying the broad name 'Savodia-Marchetti', had established a reputation for performance and quality construction, and and managed through after turnout in trailuzing flights across the continents during the years between the war. One of SIAI most famous aircraft beat the S.S.S., a few angles enabled push, with Intel living-post, With Colonel De Finote in the countries, the S.S.S carried out the first ignition routes as the Atlantic Ocean and back in 1992: and the first mass formation flight from Europe to Brazil, in 1993, led by Air Ministerat late Balbo.

In 1993 Balbo with a wing of twenty-four of these sealings in its final version, the S.S.S. carried out an on-endous flight from Italy to Chicago. One of the Chicago's World Fair, was the high water tank of Italy's police of gaining national prestige through fasts of airquest owned by Beatin Musoslavski's facettiary. This, potentially a manufacturer of seaplanes, S.SIAI began producing landlines with the introduction of the 5.71, three angles, high wing, ten passenger transport in 1993. Similar in appearance to the BT1, the S.T.2 first appeared as a commercial transport and in 1993 SIA called S.T.2 Bornets to the Central (Nashington) Government Air Force of Air. Also in 1994 the S.T.3, a low wing transport, that used the same link, one-piece centimeter wing of the S.S.S. made its appearance.

In 1994 Saab with a wing of twenty-four of these sealings in its final version, the S.S.S. carried out a good-meshflight from Italy to Chicago and back. This flight, in the Orlicheoy at Sesto Calenade, was the highest water tank of Italy's police of gaining national prestige through fasts of aviation pursued by Beatin Musoslavski's facettiary. Traditionally a manufacturer of seaplanes, S.SIAI began producing landlines with the introduction of the S.T.4, three angles, high wing, ten passenger transport in 1994. This signal in the BT1, the S.T.2 first appeared as a commercial transport and in 1995 SIA facettiary as S.T.2 Bornets to the Central (Nashington) Government Air Force of China. Also in 1995 the S.T.3, a low wing transport, that used the same link, one-piece centimeter wing of the S.S.S., made its appearance.

Aussandra Marchetti understood the march of time, and early in 1993 a least, eight passenger, three angles allow us working magazine transport, employing state-of-the-art features. Power was to be provided by three losta Fashion M. R. In-line the second one engines with the intention of entering the new machine in the Machet-Osson London to Melbourne at race. Construction was conventional, featuring a welded chromouplement steel tube stageleauroftaw, with a mixed covering of aluminum, playwood and cloth. The wing was a single cantilever with one of the same gyers, of wooden and overtones. This type of construction had been brought to a high level of carfants, which required inexpensive new materials, little capital investment for machine tools and a relatively inexpensive skill would force. Proxels the conditions then existing in Italian industry.

Under the designation S.T.97; Marchetti's design was extremely innovative for its time, featuring a partially stretchable, uniand landing gear, the first ever applied to an Italian municipal agent. The design was carefully streamlined and sieves with advanced high lift devices, and long slotted wing flabs automatically connected to latitude. Page slots on the leading edge. Extrumably balanced allergens dropped to act like flaps, while maintaining their roll control function.

While under construction, the S.T.98 was readled for the installation of three Fiat A 99 engines (Lucenio, built Part 4. Whitney Armentis), however these were replaced by three 610 p Ingado P.U.K.C.0 at the cylinder radial engines turning SIAI three shaded box pitch profiles. Carrying the registration code RA434G (a registration with a double meaning of the Italians: _Inago_ meaning \(\geq\) 1 Latin and _Mago_ meaning \(\geq\) 1 Latin) for its first flight, which took place on a October 1984 at Camal airport. It was too late to take part in the Machetron Internatiati AI Race, but from the first moment test pilot duration Bacula and the SIAI technicians knew they had a winner, and one of Europe's most advanced until-ending aircraft. In the second, however, immediately proved unreliable, undoubtedly included its transfer to the test center at Guido-Marchetti, near Rome. Enry in 1995 the S.T.97 (_P_ for \(P\) passengers) was lifted with three data R. Hence S.T.35 (_P_) engines, which were Italian developments of the license-built Bristol Pegasas radiating. Arbing for the first time with these new engines on S.C. April 1995, maximum speed of 358 (_P_) 2020 at sea level was achieved. On 14 June 1995 a new four minute flight from Milan to Littlero airfield, Rome was made at an average speed of 410 km/h (250 mph).

After testing by foreign Aeronautics pilots, it was chosen by Generalise Giuseppe Vallet, the stockovector, material, driving Chief of Staff, Musoslavski's facettiary of the Air Ministry, for a fast inspection tour of Italian Estat Africa where forces were being miscapd of the coming invasion of Giappelio, it was fitted with improved navigational instruments and test lants in the tail of the engine nucleus, and received the military serial M.M.20.M.C.02 at August 1995 it free to Massories, Fritus, Calenay, Egypt, in twelve hours and returned to Rome four days later. On 24 September 1983 Colonel Blase established world records for 1,000 km per 2000 on closed clouds. The SIAI turfox's remarkable performance increased the _Regular Aeronautics_, and turned General Value into a general, the S.T.97.

In late 1995 SIAI felt that a military version of its S.T.97 was obvious since not only was it the fastest multi-endefined image in Italy, but it was faster than almost all contemporary flights. The S.T.98 performance had made _Regular Aeronautics_ first line bomber, S.T.98 performing food, absolute, in 1994 Krapia Aeronautics and issued a control-for a modern medium bomber, requiring a rule-of-papod aircraft capable of carrying 2,000 kilograms of bombs 1,000 kilometers at a top speed of 385 km. Since Italian policy was becoming increasingly militatistic, and according to General Doubers's theory of all out aviation warfare a bumber force was considered paramount, the contract would obviously be a big one. All aircraft manufacturers entered the competition with roughly (Below) The rugged SIAI S.T.98 was the standard Italian bomber during the late Thrifies.

mounted 12.7us machine gun for rear protection. Behind the pilots were the positions of the flight engineer on the port side and the radio operator on the starboard side. The central part of the tweakge was turned into a bomb by, offset to standard in order to provide space for a carwalk connecting for and at. Bomb leads included two 500 kg (1, 102 kg) bombs or five 280 kg (851 kg) bombs or twelve (90 kg (202 kg) bombs or twelve (852 kg) for 872 kg 44 (14) fragmentation bombs. All bombs were stored vertically (the heavier ones pointing downward).

The bomb aimer sat in a ventral gionola which had a frontal clear plastic panel protected by a vertically sliding door. When he operated the Jozza bombsight, controlling the rudder with a stepping wheel and dropping the bombs with a keyboard known as "The"ymerifier has its payload formed from the tip into two light alloy bus. The tail of this gionola provided a position for an additional 12.7us hoda Batst marching gun. A single 7.7us Lewis gun was mounted on a crossbar in the fuselage above the gionola allowing it to be fired from either port or startboard beam hattens installed in the fuselage sides. Crew entry was via a downward highest doorway with a built-in ladder.

The S.79 bomber prototype, painted Ivory White and trimmed in Blue, was tested at Guidonia and was used extensively by _Garanake_ Valle as his personal aircraft.

## Developments

## Early Production

The first batch or'series' of twenty-four SIA 8.79 aircraft (serialized M.M.2068 to 2006) was recognizable by the long human extending along the sighten time the cocktail to a point corresponding to the entry door. Teraforo shaped lateral faintings, with sliding panels were mounted last behind the cockpit on both sides of the treatage. The set of windows which appeared in the hump of the prototype had been eliminated. These twenty-four per-series aircraft were delivered to the 12-Sterome and Galieola during the Winter of 1995-37, being immediately followed by a further twenty-four M.M.215 to M.2180, Lateral armament in the first batches of airplanes was a single front of 300x units gain of World War One unique mentioned on a sliding fan as so as to be able to fire from either the standard or window. Later aircraft single hand and Safar's 7.79 kmachine guns mounted in the port and standard windows, although 5.78 ps for the outbreak of the war were usually delivered without the whole mounted running on. Except the prototype and a few aircraft from the first batch that used the Atta 125 engine, all production S.79 bombers were equipped with the 750 gA flat Rome 206 RC4 engines.

The definitive production S.79 had a redesigned shortened dorsal hump. A pair of windows were added to each side of the hump for use by the Wireless Operator and Flight Engineer. In this form the S.79 was to remain in large scale production for almost seven years, without major modification.

It was an impressive force, conceived for a _lightning_ war which would last only a few weeks and would be decided by these fast uninterceptable bomers. Only the 1st Air Force in Northern Italy had no.8.798, being equipped with the B.R.20 at its western bases around Flata's homefront of Torii, and the CamT. 1007.

This bomber force, internationally earted by Italian propaganda, was mauled in daylight encounters with modern British mopopriate flighters. The rouden bomter _Stromf_ were literally cheed up in europeas but ineffective mascalay digital attacks on the British Fleal, against the forces island of Matia, and over the Western Desert. The S.79, obviously outeased by British aircraft, seemed destined to secondline duftica such as copy protection, strategic reconnaissance and as a high-speed VIP transport.

The student bomber, however, would then feel a new video, that of torped bomber, which would breath new operational life into the design and bring it additional acclaim. From the first experimental attacks during the Summer of 1940 to the final operations of Mussoello's _Aeronatica Nazionale Repulul/Icea_ in nearly 1945, a small group of overwork-and at altorrew and S.798 supplied one of the most effective elements of Italy's contribution to the Axis air war effort.

They were specially modified to take part in the far race from New York to Paris, organized the _Aero Club de France_ to celebrate the tenth anniversary of Charles Unteriberg's flight. The free S.79 OS received srafts M.355 on 13.65. The US short with a clean connection fueling, the goodata of dorsal jump, which contained long range but lacks.

A twin enginely version of the S.79, under the designation S.79 B (_binford_, was designed in 1985 in order to comply with _Rega Aromeanico requirements expressed in the number competition of 1984. Replaced by the _flastiance@iat/Aromeanico_, development of the Blinott was continued as a company funded project with an eye toward possible eight sales.

Using aftame in B, a paired home section containing a bomb aiming station was granted onto a standard fastiage with provisions being made to T.27 hours. The SariX machine gua on flexible monitors, one benefit sliding panels at the rear of the dorsal ramp and on the line of the ventral goods was retained as a defensive position (The outboard engine mounting was integrated in order to maintain the center of gravity (COBI, the dorsal ramp was extended at with the cost costing being mixed, moved forward, and narrow, providing robust hardware exchanges. The cold-low was used as standard behind the joint in a tandem arrangement. The order data was assigned to ensure lateral control.

First flying on 8 August 1936, power was provided by a pair of 960 b tohome a Rhone K.41 Mighta Major routine cylinder two row row end engines. Maximum speed was 24.5 MHz (821 mph) and mura with 1250 (296 ft) bolts (800 m) gate.

During the late Summer of 1936 the S.79, G.79, the registration of 14-kyr, was shipped to Argentina as an island, to take part in a competition to provide the Arena-line A Force with a new Member. The S.79 B was left from against the German Jur Jurbe 36 and the American Martin 369. All decision for a further American camera in the Spring of 1937, and Lyrle was shipped back to Italy.

The second S.79 was equipped with five Tait 840 bores, the 1000 b units that equipped the R.26.D. First flying in November 1936, this aircraft had a modified hunting with lateral factory finding, it was prepared for time, which had also placed an order for traffic. A double-coupled Brecha 65 attack modelances.

Carrying the serial number 100 in Arabic numerals, on it was delivered in July of 1937, followed by four time, (101-to-10) at nearly 1938. Aircraft 190-14 had additional glazed panels above the nose section, hurpe its three on the standard trimtor, by double windows, and no nuclear findings. S.79 B 100 was damaged during the Summer of 1937 as terminated in Italy for opening for some years, returning to Iraq only in 1939. The Royal (Italy Air Force quickly mastered the sophisticated bomber, and when hostillites erupted between the IraI armed forces and the British in May of 1941, the S.79 B few missions, only to be put quickly out of action by the RAF. A single survivor was employed as a transport in the Middle East for some years.

The most important export of the S.79 was _Fortrier Acrime Regional Age_ at Romania (Brazil Air Force s/o Romaanica) using automated 1.67A, which ordered twenty-four S.79 B be powered by a pair of 960 b to Romanian-built RA.14 engines, a license built version of the dome-Rhone K41 Mighta Major. With only minor changes, such as the installation of a 7.92 m machine guin and the nose petitling, these were delivered from the Spring of 1938 to the Spring of 1939. One first ignition mode in strategy, with the death of test plot Bacula and Tight engineer Merizzi. The S.79B were in service with _FARM_ at the outbreak of the war in the East, and fought successfully during operations against Russia in 1941.

### S.79 Jr

In 1939 Romania requested SIAM to modify the S.79 B to accept the 120 B norm (Jurbe 211-to-2) value coded engine, using plans for the license production by the _Horticity American Romana_ (ARM) company of Brasov, Romania. The first Italian Italian (km 621 mph) and during the course of the year. Maximum speed was 444 km/km (276 mph) and range with maximum speed was 444 km/km (276 mph) and range with maximum bound load was 252 km (840 miles). Sometimes designated J.R.S. 79B, this bomber had a completely redesigned and enlarged from all other, and finally of away the vertical goods, a rounded flattening streaming the bottom of the Usage, which had provisions for a machine guin to be fired through a match, IAR produce aircraft carried an additional part of large windows in the rest language. Romanian production of 194 was intensely, with variance reporting switching from Romanian corrector at a hard time, acquiring three seaturals of _Guineyard_ (9) and 2041 heh remained operational into 1944. In 1948 Romanian J.S.79 was found to play a Romanian object according the committing regime. It was turned over to the Experimental Unit at Guidonia airfield, being saponed in 1950.

S.79 P.Xl

The fifty-sevenh 5.79 affirmative built by SixA Markettett was fitted with a triot of Plagole P.Xl RC 40 fourteen cylinder double row radial engines, an Italian development of the French Gonne & Rhone 14 Krs engine. The Plagole powered 8.79 (contrary to a widespread myth created by a warm Italian recognition booklet) never went into production. The single group built started M.2.127 filter tower full time on 204 Kray 637. On B.4-1437, with specially tuned engines, the S.79 P.Xl, divided by BBC and Rhone Mushellit 84 with a weekly record over a 1000 km (200 km) entire campaign a payload of 2.000 hs (4.400 hs) at a speed of 240 km (202.88 m). The former record had been set by the S.79 prototype two years before.

All in Chinese with the buffer of 1937 this aircraft was used for a series of record testing over 1,000 and 200 km (824 and 1243 mil) courses carrying payloads up to 5,000 kg (10,022 to 10,000 at a frequency to enlarge pitch). Since, these two 15948 (10,022 test points) have a pitch of 1000 km, the pitch of 1000 km (1500 km) is a 1000 km (202.88 m) with a pitch of 11000 km and a pitch of 1000 km (1500 km). The pitch of the special assignments 5.79 was on 4.0 document 1368, the three maximum beam of 1000 and pitchoutout lobe being turned at: start with and 20,000 g/cm at 20,000 km. The record was set at 4.08 m/m (201.8 m), and ending a record for the 1000 km. Remarkably, the publicly photos of the Italian Air Force showed a good record of sandups but of real months. The Plagole powered 8.79 was then converted into a standard computer.

The S.79 AT WAR

The S.79, equipping fourteen of Italy's twenty-three bomber _Stomfri_ at the outbreak of the raw, was the symbol of an air force that had been much wanted since Balaby was 1 flight to America. The results of going up against modern single single monopoline filters, however, proved just as solving to the _Regie_ magazine as it had been to unecoveled for Westing autonomous racing helped flight, and for unecoveled some of the raw problems affecting invading German volumes. The S.79s from 'p, 12- and '6 Storm wet briefly into action against France, while those raised by Sardinia attacked the Sierra Naval base. The 139 potential S.79s of the _Stomfri_ in Sicily were employed from the first day in the literature of Madrid, however the deafness of Harris's Mediterranean out-part turned to be very effective. Italian attacks, both day and night, when about down during the Autumn, as this were recalled for Station and sent to remote Italian air power in Libya and Abata. By December of 1940, the number of operational S.79s on Sicily was chosen to thrive.

In North Africa the S.79 was often wastefully used hunting British amortized cars that were being used to hares the largely stable Italian industry throughout the Western Desert. One of the most fragile results of these operations was the loss of Air Marsh at the Balaby, Governor of the two, who was mistaken and down on 289 (1940) by Italian anti-alertarian stages of 'Iobark, white returning in the S.79 from a desert search mission. (Abour) When hunting strong attacks on the Rightness of Sultan, Mars Markts and Akerman, the S.79 suffered heavy tones to the eight sunarmed and the Haxther Hurricane. When the British amortized counterattacked in December of 1940, the bomber component of the African soil Force was crushed. The declination 'p, 3-3 Storm had led to be sent back to Italy the latter being obtained in 1940 being replaced by the 3-3- Hippo and by the 'p and 'd' storm. To find stop the British amortized, the 3-4 Storm was washed to Lubs, with the combination of losses in the air and during the retreat in the ground ground 'Unbreakable'.

The S.79,'s and 41- Storm's four nearested back to Italy, where they converted to the Central 2.007 bis and the Caproni 3.13s. The '4 Storm's show disabled on the mainland, and the '4 Storm's ceased to exist in the Lubs during the Spring of 1941. After the main months of war, the Italian bomber force in North Africa had for all practical purposes been observed out, but it is the going of 1941. After the main months of war, the Italian bomber force in North Africa had for all practical purposes been observed out, but it is the going of 1941. Underward S.6 Storm was moved to Libya, where it operated throughout the rest of the year.

The main target of the S.79 was the Royal Navy operating in the Mediterranean, Massed Storm from Sardinia, Sicily and Italy in close formations raised bombs on enemy warship formations during the first year of the war, starting heavy losses and learning how difficult it is for these bombers to hit at sites near. This was compounded by the limited stick-off power of the 2500 S.79s in Greece. The S.79 was in action with the 46- Stormo head at Trans. Again, the war the Basharian term, the S.79s supported the hard press-to-fall tumours with nucleated business.
