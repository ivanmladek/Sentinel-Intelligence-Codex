## Introduction

The delta wing is not particularly new. As early as 1650, the Polish artillery specialist Kurimierz Steinowicz described the construction of rockets having delta-shaped stabilizes instead of the usual Stirling radius. In 1867 Englishman James W. Butler and Edmund Edwards were awarded a patent for a delta-winged aircraft presently by a jet of steam. But practical delta-winged aircraft are a twentieth-century development, and German and expansivities of 0.8%. Accurate Lippatch is considered to be the "father" to give another design designs. De: Lip Lipinski had completed several challenges and delta wing older designs as early as 1937 and successfully used a 60-degree delta wing in a supersonic wind tunnel in 1939. By 1940, one of the Lipinski utilises designs and been combined with an experimental German rocket to create the DFS 194, which attained a speed of 341 miles per hour that same year.

NACA scientists in the United States had also shown an interest in the delta wing. Pre-World War II studies had indicated that such a wing would have a very low aspect ratio, resulting in some very high speeds. But it was just a theory, as no powerlawt was then available to take advantage of the theory - at least in the United States.

Hurry's Air Ministry says that potential of the new design and ordered Lipinski to design and build the prototypes of what would become the Messenschmitt Me 163, the first operational fulless aircraft in history. Even unreported, the Me 163 prototype exceeded the world speed record, reaching 525 mph in unpowered drive. With a new Walter rocket engine of 1.650 pounds thrust, Lipinski's new fighter speed speeds in excess of 625 mph, some 156 mph faster than the existing record.

At the end of World War II both Lipinski and his extensive research papers fell into American hands. In particular, the design team at Convi's Downey, California, plant found the Lipinski to be quite interesting. Using data generated from the Lipinski and NACA experiments, plus tests of equator of 163 Konet aircraft, chief engineer Jack Irvine, his assistant Frank Davis, Courant design cardiophatist, and approximatical Ralph Shick put together a design proposal and submitted to the Army Air Forces.

That proposal hold to a formal contract in 1946 for a very strange-looking airplane. It was known as Secret Control MX-813, but the AAF designated 17-90^2. The new design that a triangle-shaped wave and vertical slit surfaces was not be poured by both a antijet and a rocket motor, the pilot sitting inside the intake cone. However, after wind tunnel tests indicated major problems, the Conviant renel designed the entire aircraft, keeping the 60-degree triangular platform but using a conventional luggle on a production at engine.

Extensive wind tunnel tests oscillating over 500 hours indicated that the new "delta" wing, so called to die to its similarity to the CCR letter at (4kda), had a much lower drag coefficient than any other wing type, including swipe wings. The tests also revealed that the traffic coefficient decreased as the wing leading edge angle was increased. For instance, a 45-degree swept wing, like that used on the F-100 power Sather, as had a one coefficient of 0.072. But 46 degrees, the drag coefficient dropped to an astonishing 0.048. The tests also indicated that the new 60-degree delta wing would be very stable at high altitude, but retain good low-speed handling characteristics. By November 1946, the original MX-813 project had been scrapped, and the AAF had issued a new contract to Conviant to build a single XP-92A experimental aircraft to flight test the delta wing theories.

## XP-92A (Model 7002)

The XP-92A, serial 46-682, was built during the spring and summer of 1947. One of the AAF requirements was a very short deadline for completion. As little money was available for all-new subassemblies, Conviar had to use existing components and parts to complete the airplane. The nose gear came from a Bell P-63A, while the main landing gear came from a North American F1-Fury. The ejection seat came from Conviar's own XP-81. The powerlawt would be the tried and true Allison J33-A2-10t interval, the same engine used in the Lockhecy TP-80A.

The fuselose was a slender cigar-shape with the cockpit in a conventional location due to forward fuselose. The engine would get six air through a nose intake similar to that of the Republic XP-84. The delta wing was swept at 60 degrees, as was the vertical tail. No horizontal stabilizer was to be used, the function of elevators, which controlled pitch and were normally part of the horizontal stabilizer unit on the rear of a conventional aircraft, was merged with the airclure on the trailing edge of the delta wing to create over control surfaces known as "elevens."

In the fall of 1947, the XP-92A was completed at Conviar's San Diego plant, and unit tandem tests of the new airframe immediately followed at the Ames Research Facility at Moffet Field near Oakland. The J33-A21 engine was installed during March 1948, and the XP-92A was tracked to Murc Army Air Field (4ter renamed Edwards AFB and the home of the Air Force Flight Test Center) in the California high desert north of Los Angeles, arriving 1 April 1948. Initial taxi trials began in late May, and it was during one of these on 9 June that the XP-92A, with Conviar's net pilot 'Sam' Shannon at the controls, became airborne. The first time, flying at an altitude of ten to fifteen feet over a distance of about two miles.

These tests continued over the next few weeks, the XP-92A, flow by Conviar test pilots Shannon and William Martin, making short hors across dry lake bed at Murc. On 18 September 1948, with Shannon again at the controls, the XP-92A filed off the Murc runaway for its first legitimate flight. It was the world's first powered delta wing aircraft to fly, and Shannon reported that the airplane was a stable flying platform, similar to a conventional aircraft. The new elecow flight controls worked smoothly and gave the airplane a high degree of maneuverability, but retained good low-speed characteristics that made it easy to land. Top speed approached 600miles per hour, but a lack of thrust are kept from going anywhere near Mach 1.

What was needed was much more power. Following the initial flights, the decision was made to install an Allison-233-A-23 engine of 5,200 pounds thrust in place of the original -21 engine, along with a new system tape and modified all one and cocklet energy. The airplane returned to flight us with a new system tape and modified all one and cocklet energy. The airplane returned to flight us with 10 February 1949 and was officially turned over to the Air Force on 20 My, having been designated 75-92A. Shannon and Martin continued by the airplane during the transition, a maximum speed of about 92.95 hung reached without encountering any extreme control effects.

But the airplane was still underpowered. As flight tests continued under Air Force agencies, Allison was developing a new, more powerful engine with something called an infavour, developing over 7,500 pounds thrust, and the Air Force devoted to their in the X-92A-2 installation of the new Allison J33-A-29 repaired extensive fadesion to enable the airplane and took over a year to complete, and the airplane was not returned to Edwards at mildly 1951.

Due to problems with the 29 engine, the X-92 HAO made all 21 flights by the time tests of the new powerful hot been occluded in February 1953. But one of these flights saw the airplane finally upscreen, when Air Force is quiet Check? Keyport has shown that the controls. In the full 1951 Raycer Yoster took the re-engined aircraft for a test flight, flighted to not to his back, and went into a high-speed drive. The macherher recorded 1,10, the first and only time the X-92A would break the sound barrier.

Following the Air Force tests, in 1953 the X-92A was turned over to the National Advisory Committee on Aeronautics (the former of today's National Aeronautics and Space Administration) which installed vanded engine, an Allison X-A-16/6, 6400 pounds afterburse, and a long chute. Following a landing accident, NACA elected not to repair the aircraft and returned to the Air Force, which fired in 1954. During the three-year program of development, the X-92A had made a total of 118 test flights and contributed significantly to the science of delta wing aerodynamics. It now resides at the U.S.A.F. Museum alongside other exotic test aircraft.

## The 1954 Interceptor

### Y-102 (Model 8-80)

With the Soviet Union's successful test of an atomic bomb in 1949, the United States no longer employed nuclear supremacy. The Soriets also had a delivery system for their new weapon in the "Topic IV-14, a direct copy of the Boeing B-29 Superfores. The news of the Swiss' nuclear capability started the entire world, and the U.S. Air Force started a crash program to make the skies over the Free World as safe as possible.

Officiality this program was shown as Secret Project MX-1554 -- code name "DRAGON-7"-- but unofficially it was called the "1954 Interceptor Program," so named because the Air Force wanted the aircraft operational by 1954. The Air Force's requirement was simple: an airplane that would surpass the estimated performance, both in speed and altitude, of any Soviet intercontinental jet bomber then in development or projected. Specifically, it called for a speed greater than Mach 1 in liver flight, with a service ceiling greater than 50,000 feet Project MX-1554 would be directly tied to the development of the Hughes MX-179 radar from cyclotron system and the new Hughes GAR-1 Falcon air-to-tailer interceptor missile. These two programs, such combined with the new aircraft design, were known as Weapson System 2014. On 18 June 1950, the Air Force asked for proposals from several companies for the "1954 Interceptor." Covariate was one of the companies to answer the Air Force's request.

The Convari report was as aircraft model 8-80. The model 8-80 had a general appearance not unlike the XR-92A. It used basically the same thick delta wing and tall as the XR-92A but was larger overall. The fuselge was longer by 10 feet with engine at intakes on the sides of the fuselge under the costoff instead of a single nose intake. The pointed nose was longer to house the proposed MX-1179 radar system. Power was stated to come from a single Wright J67 ( **m** **7**)

## Service Test Aircraft

YF-102 (Model 8-82)

TheYF-102 was 52 feet to inches in length, with a 38-foot wingreen. From the ground to the tip of the tail, it was 1 feet 2 inches in height - almost exactly a third larger than the Y-92-T2. TheYF-102 had a gross width of over 26,400 mm. Problems with development of the Wright 167 engine led to a decision to change the powerpoint to the Pratt & Whitney 157 engine. Maximum speed with the proposed Pratt & Whitney 157-11 engine was estimated to be 870 mph, but that would not be calculated with the first-a-method aircraft came off the assembly line.

The first Y-102, Air Force Force S2.7994, was rolled on September 1958 backload on a track and transported to Edwards at Force Base, Ground testing extended no significant problems, and a first flight due was set. In the early morning hours of 24 October 1953, Covari Chief Test (Wide Richard) Tolabson pushed the throttle forward, and the Y-102 easily held from the Edwards runway. That flight was very smooth. However, farther test flights proved that the Y-102 was not able to exceed the speed of sound in level flight, one of the major Air Force requiresments for the 1954 metermeter. Only in a close wind the Y-102 break the sound barrier, and on the 1 November, during one of these drives, the engine flanted out. Two is the middle, Johnscale could not get an air start and was forced to eject. Johnston parachuated to safely, but the Y-102 was destroyed.

The second Y-102 make its first flight on 11 January 1954, and Y-102's numbers three through 10 soon followed from the San Diego assembly line. Several changes were made (\(\pm\) 11)to the basic design in an attempt to increase the top speed without incorporating the "area rule" changes. These included revising at air intakes, completely changing the canopy to include a sharp \(\gamma\)-shaped windscreen, and lengthening the forward fastest for a better fitness ratio. However, none of these alterations helped increase the top speed above Mach 0.98, and Cavalar engineers were forced to incorporate the "area rule" concept in a redesigned fuselge.

## The YF-102A (Model 8-90)

The YF-102A, model 8-90, was the first of the true "1954 Interceptor" variants as it was the first to meet all the requirements. Most of this was directly achieved by incorporating the area rule, further refinements to the fuselge, and additional power. But redesigning the fuselge would be very costly. Of the 30,000 tools that were already finished for the YF-102A, over 20,000 had to be scrapped or modified to construct the YF-102A.

Area ruling called for the fuselge to be included just as of the wing lasting edge to fuselge junction. This injected area continued almost to the wing trailing edge. In addition, the fuselge was lengthened about 7 feet for a greater fuselge fineness ratio. The engine air intakes were also redesigned and enlarged for more volume, which would be needed when the more power-ful YF-25A engine was installed. The 2-52 engine had over 16,000 pounds thrust compared to 14,000 pounds in the -11 engine that powered the YF-102A and the -23 engine's extra power was needed to compensate for the YF-102A - vs 3,500-n would weight gain over the YF-102A.

An entirely new and thinner wing necessitated still three changes in cooling. The thinner wing was 38 feet in spun and had "flow" fences" to smooth the airflow over the elevons. In addition, the leading edge of the wing was cultured, or curved downward, for additional lift, while the wing was free but upward. Cavalar referred to this design as the "Case X" wing. All of this was done in the name of greater speed. Also, to maintain a better balance and center of gravity, both the wing and vertical up were moved more feet to the rear.

However, wind tunnel testing indicated that the area-ruled fuselge was not enough. It accompless even more "riching". But because the fuselge simply could not be misplaced any further, Convair engineers come up with a novel idea. Instead of pinching the fuselge, they would bulge the fuselge out by adding a large firing on both sides of the anfuselge. These firing further reduced drag and also located additional space for certain head engine accesses. The Couvier engineers lingingingly referred to these bulges as "low headline".

On 15 November 1954, the internally all-new YF-102A, Air force series 3-1787, was rolled out at the San Diego Plant. Whitt also was its was tracked up the California coast to Edwards AFB and made ready to fly. On 20 December Dick Johnson made his second "first flight" in an F-102A. The YF-102A flight of the runway, and Johnson ran the engine of first flight tests before returning to Edwards. No problems were encountered, and the YF-102A was rested for the ultimate test -- breaking the sound barrier. On 21 December, Johnson again strapped himself into the YF-102A's couldn and took off. After a quick check of the flight systems and controls, he put the aircraft to a slight shift and punched the afterburning the system a scant few seconds the chamber read an incredible Mach 1.22. The YF-102A was supersonic!

Further improvements included the addition of four more feet to the area-ruled fuselge to further improve the fineness ratio of the fuselge. The YF-102A/F-102A would be 63.3 feet in length. The wing fledge edge number was also adjusted. Finally, a weight reduction program was initiated, as the YF-102A had gained a considerable amount of weight with all the fuselge modifications required by the "area rule."(Above) Conval's Dick Johnson touches down in the first production F-102A, serial S3-1791, on 24 June 1955. This was the first the cost-called "Hotot Tool F-102A - reduced in weight, and having an area-winded fusepage and the 16,000-point thrust 457:23 engine. (David Menard)

(Below) A YF-102C on the ramp at Stepward AFB, Texas, in 1955. Two YF-102Cs were modified from F-102A as engineering testbeds for a proposed version of the Delta Dagger intended as a transition to the F-106. This YF-102C (serial S3-108) was painted overall Aircraft Grey with Day/toid Red nose, wings, and tall surfaces. (Metric Omsot)F-102A (Model 8-10)

The production F-102A was streamally indistinguishable from the YF-102A service test aircraft. Production aircraft would have all the refinements that were carried out and/or adjusted in the YF-102/YF-102A pla type two additional items: full armament and a fire control radar system. Production aircraft were fitted with the Hughes MC3-2 dark time control system (PCS). The non-anticotrided Hughes MC3-1179 fire control system was now stated to be installed in the follow-on interceptor, the F-102B. However, because of all the differences between the F-102A and the F-102B, the Air Force changed the designation of the F-102B "Ultimate meteor" to F-106.

The MG3-65K went into production in 1955, just in time to be installed in production variants of the F-102A. However, heightened requirements and further development led to additional improvements in the MG-3. These included an automatic flight control system and a data link based on the SAGE (Semi-Automatic Group Improvement) system that was already being installed in previous three types like F-80B. This allowed a real-time link between the ground controller and the interceptor pilot for instantaneous information upgrades. The new FCS was designated the Hughes MC3-10.

Armament for the "1954 Interceptor" was of the all-missile variety. The main armament would be his Hughes CAR1. Falcon missions (designated AM4 in 1952). The GAR-1 was directly linked to the MG-30-MG10 FCS. The F-102A was capable of launching several different types of collision, including the GAR-1 (AM4-4) radar guided missile, the GAR-1 (AM4-B) which was an improved Falcon-the CAR2 (AM4-C) which had an infrared branching capability, and the GAR-11 (AM4-B) Super Falcon, which could have a nuclear wheel. Additionally, the F-102A would have a secondary armament of at least 24 2-0-in. folding in aircraft rock (FRA) carried within the edges of the missile body doors. However, beginning with the block-51 method, the 20-in. FFARs were replaced with 27:51 "Migthy Mouse" FFARs.

The final major change to the production F-102A was in the size of the vertical fin. Initial pit tests had indicated a further and lack of directional control with the original tail design. The first 25 F-102A has a vertical tail with a height of 186er 2 inches. Covariate engineers designed a new larger and taller than was 12 feet 23 inches in height with a 10-inch longer base chord. This new larger, taller than greously increased directional stability and was incorporated on all production F-102A less beginning with the block-25 aircraft. The taller tail was also retrofitted to all previous FF-102A aircraft.

The first flight of a production F-102A, serial 53-1791, was made 24 June 1955, and the Air Force accepted the an 292 Wm, officially naming it "Delta Dagger," although it would have commonly known as the "Dene" throughout is service for the. The first batch of production F-102A was made delivered to training sound for two by future Air Defense Command platforms. In April 1956, production F-102A, albeit with the shorter 1 and earlier MG-3 FCS and weapons, entered service with the 327th Fiber Interceptor Squadron based at George AFB, California.

**YF-102A to Production F-102A**

Since the F-102 was stated to defend the United States from attacks over the North Pole, they would be deployed to areas of extreme cold weather. In March 1956 the last F-102A-15 was sent to 1add AFB, Alaska, where the temperature often reached 40 degrees below zero, for cold weather tests. (Jack Kreberger)

(Below and Below Right) One of the biggest complaints of F-102 pilots was tail fitter and directional instability at high Mach numbers. Covariate engineers redesign the vertical fit, making it three test later and increasing the chord by almost a root. On the left is F-102A-20, serial S-18160, ran Ar Proving Ground Command at Equih AFB, Florida, with its original short tail and engine intakes. On the right is the same airplane in 1960 sewage with the 460th F1 at Ethan A, West Germany, with the taller fit, larger dive brake doors, and intake ramps. (Wm. J. Balogh Sr. and David Kennedy)

Ripsey was commander of the 327th FIS at George AFB and had his aircraft painted with red chools on the intakes and fall and red, white, blue, and yellow command bands around the tussiago. The placement of the national insights is unusual. (Budot Bucher)

(Robert F. Dorn)

Col. Charles Ripsey was commander of the 327th FIS when he set a speed record from George AFB, California, to Oklahoma City in September 1956, making the 1120-mile flight at an average speed of 9135 mph. The red and white checks on the intakes were part of Col. Ripsey's personal markings. (Budot Bucher)

The colorful markings seen in 1958 on 227th Delta Dagers were replaced with the typical Red Arctic markings seen here. (Budot Bucher)

## Operational Service

The F-102A entered operational service on 24 April 1956 when the first production F-102As were delivered to the 327th Fighter Interceptator Spaator at George Arghe, California. Air Defense Command wanted to 2327th Fighter pilots to demonstrate the capabilities of the new birds soon as possible. Accordingly, in late summer 1956, 327th FIS commander CoI. Charles Riggy made a record flight from George AFB to Oklahoma City, averaging 819.5 mph over the 12th Fight. By the end of 1956, 97. F-102As had been delivered to ADC quadrants at buses along the northern border of the United States: the 11th FIS at Duluth Airport, Minnesota, the 31st FIS at Wurstinn AFB, Michigan, the 31st FIS at McDonald AFB, Washington.

Production was increased dramatically during 1957. Some aircraft were being modified for P. Worth, and the first one went to the 43th FIS at Kansas AFB, Michigan, in July 1957. By the end of 1957, ADC at 248-F10247-I0247-I024 aircraft equipped to no less than 15th European stations at buses from Washington State to upper New York, and as far south as Langley, Virginia.

The F-102A first went into operation outside the border of the United States in late summer 1957 when the 317th FIS at McDonald AFB, transitioned from F-86D to F-102As then moved to Ehnernd AFB, Alaska, connecting operations on 15 August 1957. One month later, the 33rd FIS left Wurstinn and hehe their F-102As to Ellemedf. Replacement squadrous were in place at McDowd and Wurstinn before the 317th and 31st deployed to Alaska.

As with every new aircraft, put into service, unexpected problems switched that had not shown up on the service test aircraft. The electronic equipment was constantly being upgraded as newer systems became available. The main landing gear had a nasty habit of collapsing, leading to a redesign of the oleo start mechanism and tilting the main gear leg slightly forward a couple of degrees. The speed brakes were found to be inadequate, so Convari designed a larger set of speed heade dosos which were retrofitted to all aircraft then in service. Range was great-ly increased by 230-gallo droughte underwing fuel tanks which were designed and tested during the 1956. These tunes were needed for the pilots that were taking their aircraft to Alaska, as the F-102A had no inflight refueling capability.

The big delta was swept through a major redesign resulting from flight test in 1956. The early F-102As and TT-02As had not Convari effort to as the "Case X" wing. The leading edge of the Case X wing was designed with a distinctive downward leading-edge twist or ram-beer. The wing tip, however, were twisted upward. On the top of the wings were four airflow fences. The redesigned "Case X" sidehead the upward twist to the wing, increased the amount of camber through the entire leading edge including the wing tips, and had a single horizontal adapt under such edge that side for the attachment of the 230-gallo underguers hall. The "Case X" wing increased the service ceiling by 4,200 feet and upped the top speed by an additional 0.06 Mach at 50,000 feet.

Other changes during reduction and operations included the addition of an intake splitter prior or ramp to help smooth air flow into the 575 engine. The original intake design caused a distinctive high frequency fuselage "Ruzz" which the new intake ramp plates eliminated. Plots also complained that the revised, narrow windscreen had an indefinite amount of glare, so the Convair engineers designed a thin splitter plate that was installed down the inside center of the windscreen. Painted flat black, the splitter plate eliminated the glare. But it did take some time for the pilots to get used to not being able to see through the plate. (\(\blacktriangledown\)20)

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:20]

The fire control system was upgraded with the addition of a data link that gave the pilot instantaneous updates from the Ground Control Intercept (GCI) controller. The Hughes MG-10 FCS also incorporated this data link. Although it did not give the same exact capability as the Semi-Automatic Ground Environment (SAGE) system employed by F-86L Sabre interceptors, it was a very close second.

Under Project B1G EBGTI, the arm was upgraded by replacing the 20-in, FFAR rock-ets with standard 2.75-in. FFARs, and an infrared scanner was added with a distinctive seeker "lut" installed just in front of the winders. This allows use of the ADM-4C Falcon, which had an infrared seeker Next. Normal operational armment thereafter became three ADM-4A/B radar-guided Falcons and three ADM-4C/OGTrid Falcon Falcon.

In 1963 the F-102A received a nuclear capability with installation of a launch kit that allowed carriage of the Hughes AIM-264/B Super Falcon air-to-air missile. The AIM-26 could have either a conventional warned or a nuclear warned with a 1.5-kiloton yield. The use of AIM-26 nuclear missiles would only be allowed when defending against a confirmed mass bomker attack on the United States. Six quadrants -- three ADC and three Air National Guard quadrants -- received the AIM-26 nuclear capability. Installation of the AIM-26 kit to fire either conventional or nuclear warned causes deletion of the FFAR option.

In June 1958, the F-102A was deployed outside of North America for the first time, when the 327th FIS, the first operational 17-102A squadron, took 10 of their F-102As and two TF-102As from George AFB, California, to Thule AB, Greenland. Some of the 327th's aircraft had the AAV/ASA-21 TACAN navigational and installed when the deployment took place. However, even though the aircraft had TACAN receivers, there were few TACAN transmitters along the route to Thule. To their dissary, the F-102A pilots had to be escorted by F-89s all the way to Gouse Bay, Labrador.

By the end of 1958, the Air Force had 651 F/TF-102As on the inventory, most of them (**n2**3)

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:22]

in Air Defense Command. However, it was at that time that ADC was beginning to transition into the follow-on aircraft, the F-106A Delta Dutt.

By the end of 1959, the number of F-102As in ADC was down over 150 aircraft, due in part to crashes and vinealls, but mostly due to transfers to buses and solutions outside ADC's control. On 3 January 1959, United States Air Force Europe (USAREIX) received its first F-102As when the 52th FSI and BIBurg, Germany, exchanged their F-85OR for F-102As. Two months later, on 9 March 1959, the first F-102As became operational in the Far East, when the 16th FSI transited to F-102As at Nauh A, Ghixnaw. Seven squads in Pacific Air Free (PACPAC) drew five F-102A between March 1959 and June 1971, including two squads that fire down during the Vietnam War.

Three years before the Gulf of Tonix incident drew the United States into the war in Vietnam, PACA edgreved F-102As to Thailand. In April 1961, PACA'er initiated Operation BELT, TONSE, sending four F-102A aircraft from Clark A3, Philippines, to Don Muang Airport, Bangkok, Thailand, to bolster Thai air defenses against a possible communist threat from North Vietnam.

In late March 1962, U.S. radars detected several aircraft flying along the Vietnam-Cambodia border. Thinking that these could be North Vietnam L1-88 "Beagle" jet bombners. PACA headquarters ordered Operation WARE/ROGLASS, which sent three 509h FSI F-102As and a single TF-102A to Tan Son Nut AB, South Vietnam. In November 1963, WATERGLASS was replaced with Operation CANDY MACHINE, which ordered a regular deployment of F-102As to brass in South Vietnam and Thailand. Aircraft from the 64th FSI rotated to bases in South Vietnam at DaNng and Tan Son Nut, while aircraft front the 509h went to bases in Thailand including Udom and Don Muang Airport near Bangkok.

## Appendix A Air Guard Service

F-102A8 began entering service with the Air National Guard in early 1960. The first unit to transition to the Delta Dagger was the 182nd FTS, Texas ANG, at Kelly AFB near San Antonio, which converted from F-86L Subreses in 1 July 1960. One of their missions was to keep an eye open for intruders coming from the island of Cuba, which had been turned into a communication after Field Castro overtheries the Battista government in 1995. Third nation would be the focus of many of the Guard units used in the southern United States. Certainly the most famous F-102P slot was one that flew with the 11th FFS, Texas ANG, 1st L George W. Bush, later to become the 43rd President of the United States.

In all, at least of 22 Air National Guard quadrides operated the F/TF-102A between 1960 and 1976. The last Guard squadron to operate the Delta Dagger was the 199th FIS, Hawaii ANG, which retrieved its aircraft in October 1976. All Air National Guard quadrants operated under the control of Air Defense Command, later called Aerospace Defense Command, except the 199th FIS, Hawaii ANG, which was under the control of PACAF.

### TF-102A (Model 8-12)

Because of the radical differences between the delta-winged F-102A and other Air Force aircraft, Air Training Command (ATC) faced the need to train pilots for the transition from conventional aircraft like the F-80B slope, and Air Defense Command concourced. But the only other jet trainer in service was the Lockheed T-33A, with the North American TF-100CF-100F on the horizon, and neither type had flying characteristics similar to, nor was as complicated as, the F-102A. Furthermore, radar training for interceptor pilots was being carried out in the TB-25J version of the World War II-vintage Michel bomber. What was needed was a trainer version of the F-102A.

In April 1991, an ATC and ADC approval, the Air Force cover down the General Operational Requirements (GOR) for a two-set, dual-control version of the F-102, and Coravier engineers began planning and design work on the two-set variant, known as model 8-12. Air Force approval was granted on 16 September 1993, and the trainer program was put on hold until the problems that had been encountered with the TFF-102A were overcome. The mockup of the trainer now was built at Conavi's F. Worth, Texas, plant and approved by the Air Force in September 1994.

The trainer variant would be identical to the single set variant from the leading edge of the wing. But unlike other trainer aircraft types, the TF-102 would feature side-by-side seating rather than the normal tandem session used in the T-33A, TF-86F, and the TF-100C. The cockpit was widened between inches, and an entirely new canopy was designed to fit over the wider cockpit, which contained identical sets of controls for both pilot and co-pilot, including duplicate fire control system radar displays. An entirely new nose section was designed to attach to the single-set interceptor's far fuselage and wing structure.

One of the requirements of the Air Force set forth in the original GOR was that the TF-102 not only be a dual-control trainer but also must be a dual-role aircraft -- trainer and interceptor. The TF-102A would be fully robust capable, and both tollos cold free the weapons, which were identical to that of the single set guitar -- as AIM-4Falec missiles and 24F FRAR rocking within the weapons bay doors.

The TF-102A also used the same Hughes MG-3 FCS as the F-102A. However, when the F-102A was upgraded with the MG-10 FCS, the TF-102A were not retrofitted with the new unit.

In July 1994, the Air Force placed an initial order for 20 TF-102A, followed by an additional order for 28 more in early 1995. As with the mockup, the Cowaru plant in F. Worth would construct the nose, which would then be transported to San Diego for mating on an F-102A airframe. Rollout of the first TF-102A, serial 5-1351, came in October 1995, and Conaviar pilot.

Jock Johnson made the first flight on 8 November 1995.

Excer for the enlarged forward fluselage, which led to the aircraft's nickname of "Tb," the TF-102A was quite similar to the single-set fighter in phantom and performance. The TF-102A retained the original "Case X" wing and short vertical in fan os on the initial batch of F-102As, but the fuselage was free for better, or 63 feet 43 inches. Power came from the same Pratt & Whitney 157-23 engine rated 16/00 pounds thrust in afterburned.

The builder forward fuselage and second cockpit added over 500 pounds to the combat weight of the TF-102A, and due to the additional weight and drag of the new, wider rose, the TF-102A was quite a bit slower than the single seater, with a top speed of Mach 1.0. Rate of climb and service ceiling were comparable.

Early flight tests indicated several problems with the TF-102A. All of the problems associated with the single seat variant, such as a lack of directional control due to the short fin, were also found and corrected on the TF-102A. Installation of the taller vertical fin corrected the (**)44**A T-102A-45 from the 57th FRS on the ramp at Kefefawik, Iceland, in September 1968. The ribbon above the national insignia is the Air Force Outstanding Unit Award. Operational squadrons equipped with the F-102A had two T-102As included in their assets. The T-102A had the same combat capabilities as the F-102A but used the MG-3 FCS, (Stephon Miller)A TF-102A-15 from the 317h FIS tuxies back to its parking spot at Ellemodorf AFB, Alaska, in 1967. The buzz code "TC" indicates a trainer aircraft, even though the TF-102A was This TF-102A-30 from the 482nd FIS at Syrumor Johnson AFB, North Carolina, seen in 1996, has a red lightning bot on the tail as its unit marking. Martings on ADC F-102A could be quite colorful, but most were rather mundane. The 482nd FIS sent a detachment to Homestrade AFB, Florida, in response to possible Cuban aggression following the failed Bay of Pigs Invasion in 1961. (USAF)

**How on regular operations alongside the fighter aircraft which were coded "FC." The intra-red search and track (HST) seeker is directly in front of the windscreen. (Joe Bruch) in directional stability problems.**

But one problem that was immediately noticeable and would not go away was a substantial buffer, especially at Mach 0.9 and beyond, caused by the design of the canopy. The taller vertical all alleviated some of the problem but not all of it. Initially, Convenar engineers redesigned the canopy, making it slightly lower in height and with a revised canopy windscreen, but the buffeting continued, and the lower canopy height reduced landing and taxi visibility. The Air Force and Convalar made the decision to revert to the original canopy design and fix the buffet. Convalar engineers found that by fixing small sheet metal tubs known as 'voters generators' at various spots around the canopy, the buffeting was alleviated.

After much experimentation, the combination of the latter vertical tail and installation of the vortex generators was found to have eliminated the buffet. The third prototype TF-102A, serial 154-1353, was used out in June 1956 with the improvements included, and flight tests confirmed that the buffet was gone. By late November 1956 the Air Force was satisfied and gave Convalar an order for 169 TF-102A. However, due to the problems that caused many halts in production, plus introduction of the F-106 "Ultimate Interoperoper," Air Force reduced the number of production TF-102A to 111 aircraft. The final TF-102A came off the assembly line in July 1958.

The first batch of TF-102A was assigned to Perrin AFB, Texas, where the 4780th Air Defense Wing was charged with pilot trains and transition into the F-102A. Eventually, the entire 4780th APW was equipped with TF-102A. In addition, all units that operated the F-102A Delta Dagger, whether Air Force or Air National Guard, had two TF-102A, both with full combat capabilities, assigned as part of their assets. As the F-102A was phased into Air Guard service beginning in 1960, the TF-102A were also phased into the Air Guard.

## Appendix A T-102B (Model 8-21)

The F-102B was proposed as an advanced version of the F-102A to be equipped with the Hughes MX1179 (production designation MA-1) Fire Control System and powered by the Wright 167 (wide engineer. But developmental problems with the 167 led the Air Force to change the powerfull of the F-102B to the Part A Whitney 175 engine, Weoons would have included a single Douglas MB-1 Genie nuclear-tiped missile in addition to four Hughes GAR-1 Falcon air air air air emissions, all housed in an internal bay.

In November 1955, the Air Force awarded Cowanic a contract to build 17 F-102B aircraft, then known as the "Ultimate Interoper." The mockup of the F-102B, along with the Hughes MX-1179 PCS and cockpit display, was inspected and approved in December 1955. However, there were any differences between the F-102A and the F-102B that the Air Force changed the designation of the latter to F-106 on 17 June 1956.

## F-102c

The F-102C (originally F-102X) was a Convair-proposed interceptor, to be powered by a Pratt & Whitney J57-P4/7 engine with a titanium compressor and carrying an MB-1 Genie nuclear-doped missile and four Falocons, intended as a gap filler "between the end of the service life of the F-102A and the introduction of the F-106, Two F-102As (serials 53-1797 and 53-1806) were modified as YF-102C engineering test aircraft, but the concept was rejected by the Air Force in 1957.

## Jf-102a

Any F-102A/B directed for a special project or test could be temporarily redesigned IF-102A/B. This included aircraft used to test the Douglas MB-1 Genie missile and the advanced MA-1 FCS that would be part of the F-106 "Ultimate Interceptor" package. One aircraft had the overpass by mod-fold internally cryer the JS5 jet engine that would eventually power the F-38, F-5, and the AQM-204 QDU decay missile. Another F-102A was operated by NASA's Drykin Flight Research Station, where it was flown by test plots Jack McKay and Neil Armstrong in a series of landing approach tests in preparation for the ill-fast X-20 (Dyna-Sorai) program.

## GF-102A and PQM-102A/B

The need for a high-speed drone aircraft for use as a test target led to the "Deuce's" final role. Under Project PAVE DEUCE, in 1973 the Spery-Rand Corporation converted six retired F-102A/s to remotely piloted drone aircraft for use as targets in support of the F-15 test program. Two of these aircraft, designated QT-102A, retained conventional controls and could be flown by human pilots, the remaining four were converted to PQM-102A/s. The ejection seats and all offensive and defensive amament and electronics of these aircraft were removed and a Spery-Rand Flight Control Stabilization System, a low-altitude radar, a smoke system for ground tracking, and a destruct system were installed. Spery subsequently completed at least another 65 FQM-102A conversion. Beginning in 1978, Spery converted a further 66 F-102A/s to PQM-102B and Goodyear was awarded a contract for an additional 80. The PQM-102B had all its remote-control equipment installed in the nose, allowing it to be flown manually by a pilot using conventional controls.

Many Device drones were assigned to Holloman AFB, New Mexico, where they were routinely targeted in U.S. Army surface-to-air missile tests. Others were sent to Tyndall AFB, Florida, home of the Air Force's "Willian Tell" interceptor competition, where they were flown as targets to be shot down by Air Force F-106A and F-48. The last PQM-102B was expended at Holloman AFB in 1986.

Electric to conduct the tests. Operational aircraft used in various test programs, and modified for those tests in some way, were perfused with the letter J, thus JF-102A. (_AFFTC_)
Under the PAEV IDUCLE program in 1978, the first of many F-102A/TF-102A aircraft were modified into pilotless drone aircraft, to be used in live-life exercises as targets for either surface to air miscles or air to air miscles from other intercepts. Modified by Sperry Rand converted at least 69 F-102As to POM-102As. The POM-102A had no conventional controls like those found in the OF-102A. This POM-102A (56-126S) had Red Wingoffs and tall for viability. (John Diest)
