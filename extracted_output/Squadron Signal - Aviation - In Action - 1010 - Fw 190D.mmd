## Introduction

The Fu 1900b was an in-line engine variant of the radial engine Fu 190. The in-line engine installation was designed to increase the aircraft's performance at altitudes above 24,000 feet, where the radial engine did not perform well and the American bomberations operated. In May of 1949 the Laftawist head is requirement to Messersolimanti and Focke-Wull for a Special Apollo altitude fighter\({}^{\dagger}\). Both companies submitted proposals for the new fighter, the proposal submitted by Kurt Tank, the designer of the Fe 190, would result in a much refined view 190 - the larger, and longer-winged F 152 powered by us in-line engine.

Design and testing of the proposed high altitude glid not progress well and the Alfuewater realized that the needed 'altitude fighter' would not arrive at any time even. In July of 1949 the Laftawist reported that both companies find 'a quick solution high altitude fighter\({}^{\dagger}\)'. In late 1943 Focke-Wull finished its'suck solution". The Fu 1900,80-a97 affine was strengthened and lengthened to accomod the longer January 213A (number) engine. The sub-type was designated Fe 1900-9. Prootypes of the are aircraft were tested through the fast half of 1944 to the type being accepted by the Laftawist during the early summer of 1944.

Deficients of Fu 1900-9 to operational units began in August of 1944. First impressions by fighter pilots of the Dona's, with its bomber engine, were not enthusiastic. Kurt Tank appended to the pilots by explaining this aircraft as an temporary flaw until the Tu 152 was available.

This less than jongy reaction to the new aircraft's arrival would prove to be the exact opposite of the aircraft's operational error. Once pilots become familiar with the Langman-Dora (long-osed ID). They were quite pleased with its performance and capabilities. In the closing, months of the war the Fe 1900 proved itself a match for any Allied fighter encountered in combat.

Fu 1900s were built in sub-assemblies by many sub-contractors through out Germany and assembled at specific locations. Approximately 1500 Work Numbers (production numbers) were allocated in the Fu 1900-9. Of these, almost 200 aircraft can be accomoded for. However, of the later sub-types, Fu 1900-11/21/13/14/15 aircraft, with the June 213E and F, and the Damier-Renz 600% and La engines, very few were completed prior to the warly end.

As a complimentary to the aircraft's capabilities it should be noted that Fu 1900s captured by the advancing Russian Army were guided with red stars and flow against the Laftawite-To alloy, the Fu 1900 series is coordered the best piston engine Laftawite fighter used in quantifying during the Second World World.

JeffThe **Fu 1900-9** on display at the USAF Museum at Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio. It is believed that this aircraft was used operationally by \(y\).26 and was warrendered to the RAF at Pittsburgh, then listed as either "USA-2" or "USA-15" when it made its way to the United States aboard "MHS Beaper. This may be the Fu 1900-9 which here has shown of test lights at Wright Field in 1986. The aircraft is now covered by the National Air and Space Museum and is on ten ten the "USAF Museum in Dayton. The paint scheme was for an aircraft from by the technical officer of the uI/o 3 UCP". (Author.) RightThe Far 1900-4 from the rear, the preferred view of Allied pilots. The taper from the thick forward fuselage to the thin tail assembly is evident. The tail wheel is turned 80 degrees to the right. (L. & J Wansum)

The starboard side of the fuselage showing the replica canopy (with the exterior hasp). The canopy's fit is not as close as it could be; further, the replica canopy has no rollers, so I will not slide, (L. & J Wansum)

**Focke-Wulf** **Fw 190D-9**(Above right) On the floor of the fuselage is the somewhat rounded door that also provided access to the auxiliary fuel tank. To save on strategic materials late in the war this was made of wood. The engine starter canak is clipped to the lower bubbhead just in front of the remote compass. (Author: Ryle)

(Right) Inside the fuselage looking at at the remote compass. Along the interior are vertical stiffeners that provided strength to the fuselage skinning. (Author: Ryle)(Above) The vertical antenna wire's attachment point. There is no retraction unit to maintain tension on the antenna wire so it collapses unless the canopy is in the fully closed position. (Author: Ryle)

(Above left) This view of the spine of the aircraft somewhat distorts the fact that the fuselage extension plug, which extends the length of the 0-5 series, does not change diameter as it approaches the last assembly. The extension plug has a double upper seam and the fuselage spine seam is to the right of the centerline. (Author: Ryle)

(Left) The port at side of the fuselage showing the tic-down hole/fitting tube (which extends completely through the fuselage), with the arrow pointing toward it, and the opened access hole in the fuselage extension plug. (Author: Ryle)(Right) The plug used to extend the fuselage on all Per 1900 aircraft were not as well fitted as it is on this aircraft. And even as well fitted as it is here, it is not flush at all points. On the lower left of the fuselage at of the plug a regular patch may be seen, (J. Bishop)(Above)The lower staboard side of the fuselage looking aff. There are no external skin stiffeners on the tail prior to the tail wheel as are found on the later For 1900-13. (4. Bishop)

(Above right) The MASH machine on display at Dayton may have a replica rauder. Although the metal vertical fill and the cloth rauder as painted with the same paint (PIM 78 Light Blue Gray) the rauder appears to be a different tone, a somewhat common feature of For 190 aircraft. (L. a 3 Washum)

(Above and below) The rudder control rod that controls the movement of the rudder is seen on the strabored side of the aircraft. The upper rudder connection point is just at the Wort Number. An extension of the vertical fit to provide additional lateral stability was added to the near of the standard Fw 100a vertical m: The panels immediately forward of the extension are not flush trivet. (Author: Style)

The memory is open so the antenna wire charges down stack. The aircraft's work number of (601008) indicates it was built in a production batch of eighty aircraft that were some of the last Fw 100a to be produced before the end of the war. (Author: Style)

With the canopy in the closed position the antenna wire is pulled taught. The small spring is to maintain tension. (Author: Style)The tail wheel fork is a late war welded type with prominent rough weld lines. As the war get more deseparten such things as activating weld ports were ignored especially when they did not affect the functioning of the equipment. With no original available an American tall wheel and the have been substituted. An unusual feature is the addition of a flaring around the tail wheel opening. (Author: Ryle).

The replica canopy fits poorly to the armored windscreen. The small tube on the front of the windscreen is the windscreen (cleaning) spray tube which cleaned the windscreen with fuel from the fuel line running to the fuel pressure gauge in the cockpit. It has broken and slipped down, but its lower attachment can clearly be seen. (L. & J Wahsun) embedded in the heavy glass of the armored windscreen are the main red strips of the electric anti-ice system essential to high altitude operations. The flaring (hotls) along the top edge of the windscreen are double, single, double. Other windscreen both have been documented as double, double and double. (Author: Ryle)(Above) Forward of the throtile layer is the trim indicator, starter button, and the Instrument light diffiner. On the lower instrument panel is the FF panel, above that is the long gear manual extension and the red knobled handle is the manual fuel tank selector lever. (Author: Ryle)

(Author: Ryle)(Above) The upper and lower instrument panels are surrounded by a leather cautionned (on). On the upper left, just under the combing, are the amannoun counters (which are missing) and the right of the counters is the left 16 gun sight port installed mount. To the right of the mount is the AFN2: homing indicator used for instrument approaches. (Author: Ryle)

On the right side of the lower instrument panel is the first tube and the oxygen instrument group. The missing instrument on the lower panel just below and to the right of the flare chitch is a clock (Author: Ryle)(Above and below) the checking at the rear of the cockpit, under which sits the radio equipment. The phone running across the rear of the cockpit immediately behind the seat is the “shoulder armor and is from thick. The access door behind the shoulder armor can be opened and used as the pilot’s storage compartment. This is one of several different styles of this door. (Author: Hyde)

The south was positioned of the very rear of the cockpit against the rear built into the back supported the pilots's parachute. The white button to the right of the seat is the oxygen regulator. The canopy slide track can be seen above the seat. (Author: Hyde) The shoulder-trap attachment bars are not located at twice to the lower face of the shock-der armor plate just above the seat back. Both of these attachment bars face to the left; it is not known if this procedure was intentional, accidental, or due to wartime conditions. (Author: Hyde)(Above left) The forward starboard side of the Fu 1900-0 displayed at the USAF Museum carries the flying U ambient of J03 "Udet". The smooth fit of the In-life engine installed in a radial engine designed atframe is evident. The Jamo 213A engine delivered 1,770 PABpled at master. The Fu 1900-0 was capable of 420mph at 21,654ft and had a normal range of 503 miles. (Author: Ryle)(Above right) The standard sides of the lower engine cowling just behind the cowl flows is the coolant overtrow pipe. The opening around the exhausts is somewhat larger at the front than at its rear. (.l.Bishop)

The spinner is a reproduction and the propeller blades are not the VS-111 or VS-9 blades specified for the Fe 1900-B. The circular radiator of the Fe 1900-B can be seen behind the reproduction spinor. (.l. Bishop)The lower engine cowting is in two panels, the starboard side and the port side with both the coolant and oil overflow lines exiting through the starboard panel. The cowling redistor flags are truly closed and it tightly. (_d._ Sitloop)

The port wheel well looking to the rear at the main wing, the throttle control linkages are at the top and the brass/drift ejection port runs through the center of the wheel well exiting between the wheel wells. This configuration was designed for a carrier (engine) mounted common, which was not installed on the Fw 190-9. (J. Bishop)(Figure 1). The construction of the stateboard wheeltfs forward wall with its electrical and brake lines are seen to advantage. (Author: Ryle)

A landing gear up-lock should be between the two braces outboard of the gun mount, but it is missing. (Author: Ryle)(Above and right) The forward wall of the port wheel well looking at the gun camera mount. When the pilot pressed the flying button for the wing rot cannot the camera would start rolling. The pin camera, a BSK 161mm robotic camera, was rarely installed, When the gun camera was installed, it was protected by a canvas cover. The over-sprayed remains of this cover are still installed.

The later style, blow hood canopy is made in two pieces joined at the top via a single strip of bracing. This was a simpler construction technique providing more room and visibility while still allowing the canopy to flex on opening without breaking.
