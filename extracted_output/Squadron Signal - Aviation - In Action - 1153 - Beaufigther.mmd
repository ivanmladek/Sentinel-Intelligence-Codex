## Introduction

One of the RAF's most successful and widely used twin engined fighter types, the Bristol Beaulter borrowed a number of design features from its torpedo bomker thermometer, the Bristol Beaulter. Both aircraft were innovative and leaders in their particular class. The Beaulter was the first modern torpedo bomker and the Beaulter the first combat-worth twin-engined fighter to enter RAF service and as such they both found a rightorial place in the Royal Air Force "hall of time."

## Beautiful Mk I

By combining requirements for a torpedo bomker and a general reconnaissance (GR) bomber, the Beaulter was to become the most effective land-based anti-shipping aircraft the RAF RadT had for the first three years of the war, to reignited in two official specifications issued during1935 (M.15/35 which covered a twin-engined torpedo bomker of 6.24/35 for General Reconsonsistence type) and was built to the revised Specification 10/36. A contract with Bristol for an initial batch of seventy-eight aircraft was placed by the Air Ministry in August of 1936.

Known as the Bristol Type 152, the Beaulter was directly derived from the earlier Type 150, which was based on the Bristol Beaulter. The Type 150 was similar to the Beaulter who used in the Beaulter model of the newly forward by fifty-four inches and the dorsular turped at two maintain in the center of gravity. Space was provided for a radio operator's position between the flight deck and turped. A single topo could be carried in an internal way.

When Specification G.24/35 was developed by Bristol into the Bolingbrae, a Bleentin variant built exclusively in Canada, the company concentrated on a design which had torped bombs a its main role. The Type 152 had the nose extended by a further nine inches to make room for a navigator's position adjacent to the pilot. An aerial camera was also to be located next to the radio station. Still based on the slim BEHening tasking, this configuration meant that the torpedo could not be enclosed completely but was semi-recessed in the fuseluge underside.

The Air Ministry accepted the method of torped carriage, but insisted on a crew of four. Brissol accordingly enlarged the fuselage and raised the forward roof line, during the dorsal gun truck into a "step" at the rear end. The navigator's position was moved forward to share the glazed nose with a bomb airner's station, while the pilot now evolved a much improved view from the higher cockpit.

The Beaulter prototype was painted in primer and had **sturosy**_nacels_ and **no** landing gear doors to enclose the main wheels when it was rolled out during 1938.

The Beaulter had fewer planed panels on the port side of the nose than on the starboard side. Production aircraft differed very little from this prototype, apart from the addition of arrangement.

In this revised form the Beaulter prototype, L4414, made its first flight from Fulton on 18 a October 1938. Bristol Taurus III engines were fitted after their originally specified Penseus VI power plants were found to be incapable of delivering the required top speed.

As Fiona began Robert Mk I production, Australian interest in the type of eighth aircraft built (L4448) being shipped to Australia, together with twenty sets of airframe parts. Australian-built Beaufurs were to have been used by RAF saturations in Malaysia as well as by the RAAF, the former aircraft having British engines. In October of 1939 the Australian government declared instead to license-build the Pratt and Whitney Twin Way engine and, in the event, at 1700 aircraft produced in Australia were fitted with these U.S. engines.

Engine overtime and other problems delayed the Beaulter's entry into RAF service until January of 1940 when No 22 Squadron on Thorney Island took delivery of its first aircraft. By that time the Bristol's order book had been metrosc to 350 aircraft.

The Taurus engines still gave trouble, but No 22 Squadron began torpedo training and in April had moved to North Cues to initiate nine-lixing operations. The loss of the squadron commander's aircraft as a result of engine failure led to the Beaulter being grounded in June for engine modifications. By that time, No 42 Squadron had equipped with the type, to start "Rover" stories against German shipping and base in Norway.

As the only two Beaulter quadrupons, Nos 22 and 42 Squadrons carried out many daring operations, including a strike on the German helitest SCHARNDRS on 21 June 1940. The following summer two more quadrants, No 86 Squadron at North Cues and No 217 Squadron on Thorney Island, were -equipped with Beaufurs.

The two original Beaulter quadrupons were highly mobile, flying series in small detachments or at full strength from base through the UK, using airfields mounted in their targets. For example, a single No 22 Squadron Benufort Hew from North Cues to torpedo the 5,000 ton Transport MULTI

## Beaudort Mk V

Australian Beauforms (identifiable by their larger fin area compared to RAF aircraft) served with ten operational weapons pass second line units. A widely used type in RAAF service, the Beaudert was widely and directionately regarded as reliable "workforce" which, in addition to being a fine cohort aircraft, put Australia's aerospace industry on its feet.

The Beaudert ended its RAF service in late 1944, many examples having served out their time as crew trailers. These included the last 121 of a final batch of 250 Mx Hs built with the turert position faired over. UK and Australian Beaufector production totalled some 2,129 aircraft.

## Beautifuler Mk I

As Bristol prepared to flight-test the first Beaufort, chief designer Leslie Fris and his colleague, Roy Faddon, undertook a design study of the new tepped bomber to see where the airplane could be adapted into a "stop-spot" fighter. The RAF would, it was estimated, be critically short of fighters in the event of war.

The idea of producing a fighter with minimum cost and without the long time scale needed for an entirely new," our _soft_ headway," aircraft was enthusiasticly taken up by the Air Staff. A few days after the Heart Beautifuler fle, Bristol was asked to build four prototypes of the "Beautiful fighter."

Some useful preliminary work on fighter projects powered by the company's Hercules engines had already been undertaken at Filton. Among them was the Type 156. By utilizing the Beautiful's wing, all until and landing gear, Bristol engineers were able to refine the Type 156 as the first prototype Beaufier in just six months.

A new, similar festive was added to the Beautifuler components, with a short, solid base incorporating a single set cockp. A dorsal position for an observer was located at the fesstage mid-point and, serialized N2052, the new aircraft made its madden flight on 17 July 1939, provision that been made for an armament of four 200st camon, although these guns were not fitted for the first flight.

**With the first few test flights having shown the Beautifuler's potential, the prototype was camontized and for a time it had the undersurances finished in the "half and half" fighter recognition color scheme of White and Black, which was in use during 1940.**

Considering work was now needed to turn the Beautifuler into an operational combat aircraft and almost a year was to pass before the RAF received its first aircraft. In that time Bristol was able to refine the design and boost the performance, which with early Herculesengines, was similar to that of the Hawker Hurricane, 335 mph at 13,500 feet. For the Beaufighter, the aim was 360 mph at 15,000 feet with Bristol Hercules VI engines.

Only Hercules III engines were immediately on hand, these giving the Beaufighter "Hurricane performance" and after Air Ministry Specification F1/13/9 was issued to cover the Beaufighter, production commenced on a first batch of 300 aircraft. With the engine supply situation far from certain, it was agreed that the Beaufighter wing should be able, with minimum modification, to take in-line Rolls-Rolls Giffron engines as an alternative to the air-cooled Hercules rhalds.

With its steep ground angle and large engine cowings jutting forward of the wings, the sub-nosed "Bean", a set became known to its reses, immediately impressed coaldiews who saw a tough, workmarking design with excellent forward vision for the pilot and space enough for heavy arrangement. Handling trials with the prototype were generally good, apart from a need to increase the vertical fin area and to sifting the elevator control circuit. The landing gear was also revised, Lockheed does legs being introduced to replace the Vickers units. The propeller blades were shortened by three inches to maintain an adequate ground clearance.

Bristol built four Beaufighter prototypes (R2052 to R2055) for pre-service tests, although the summer of 1940 saw some curtailment of the future development program while the outcome of the Battle of Britain was awaited. The second prototype, R2053, soon joined the flight test program. This aircraft was also unarmed, but Beaufighter number three, R2054, had four common and their blast tubes installed under the forward fuselage, together with armor plate, a bullet-proof windscreen and a gun camera. Located directly in front of the pilot, the camera position gave most Beaufighters a distinctive bulge on top of the nose.

The first two prototype Beaufighters were passed to the RAF for evaluation in April of 1940 and that June, the Aeroplane and Amament Experimental Establishment (A&AE) at Boscombe Down received R2054. A&AE pilots found that a fully combat-worthy Beaufighter, inevitably weighed down by military equipment, barely managed 309 mph at 15,000 feet. Otherwise, the test report was generally favorable, although R2054, in common with all Beaufighters, had a tendency to swing on take-off, a factor partially aggravated by the forward position of the engines.

One way to improve the Beaufighter's performance, pending adequate supplies of the Hercules VI engine, was to fit the only alternative power plant that was available, the Rolls-Royce Merlin. Design modifications, primarily to the engine macelles, were therefore made for a new model which was designated the Beaufighter Mix II. The Merlin XX engine installation was confirmed for 450 of the 1.218 Beaufighters on the Fulton production line by mid-1940, and three airframes (R2058, R2061 and R2062) were set aside to serve as MK II test-beds.

As part of the development of the Beaufighter, Bristol made a number of airframe refinements. These included shortening the engine needle failing on the wing upper surface to reduce drag, fitting doors to completely enclose the main landing gear wheel and deleting the fuel jetignpins from the outer wing tanks. These pipes were replaced by a nearrampment which drew fuel from both inner and outer tanks and jettinessed it from a single short pipe at the end of each engine maele. Another small change was the relocation of the oil oil colors from the engine maele to distinctive wing leading edge fairings outboard of the engine maelele, similar to the Beaufort.

Only the four Hispamo carmon, mounted in the lower forward front fuselage, were fitted to the first fifty production Beaufighters, but subsequent Mx Is were standardized with an additional six. 303 inch Browning machine guns in the wings, two on the port side and four on the standard. This spun combination made the Beaufighter the most heavily armed aircraft in service with the RAF for the duration of the war. While little could be done to increase the Beaufighter's disappointing performance owing to the lack of more powerful engines, the need to improve stability led Bristol to slightly increase the fin area and sifting the elevator control.

**R2054 was the third proppe Beaufighter which was used for tests of the sixty round ammunition drum feed for the fuselage mounted 20mUR cannon armament.**

## Beautifulher Mk IF

With the Luftawite increasingly turning from day to night bombing during the Full of 1940, new priority was given to the testing of the first airborne radar sets, which were being read-fed for installation in a suitable night fighter aritrane. The RAF had few aircraft to undertake this vital role, although Blenehings had been modified as an incoming night inneceptor. What was needed as a large, preferable twin-epaired, aircraft which could accommodate the radar and an operator, with sufficient performance to catch the tangle (omething the Blenehium lacked). The Beautifulher offered the RAF an ideal answer.

In the night fighting tooz, a sparkling performance was not so important and the Fisher incorporation (HIU) at Ford carried out the necessary work to fit an Airborne Interception (AIM) Mrk IV radar to the Beautifuler Mk IF. Individual aircraft had the distinctive "box and arrow": retrograde aerials fitted on the nose and pairs of rod receiver antennas on both wingings. The radar scope was installed in the observer's position. He guided the pilot onto the target by intervention directions, reading the range, direction and angle of approach to the mercury aircraft from his scope.

Along with the night fighter clear, Beaufighters adopted an appropriate overall Mark Black finish known as RDM2, which had in the automotive quality that was not immediately realized. While Black paint absorbs available light, it also attracts heat. More than a few crew members learned this to their cost when climbing aboard a Beautifuler that had been standing out in the sun for some hours before the off-line aircraft's skin became so hot that it could cause blisters.

Bewinger Mk IF 2809 (five first night interception sterile while it was assigned to the Fisher Interception Unit (FUI), on the night of 45 September 1940. The first interception flight by an RAF saturation Beaufier was on 1718 September when No 29 Squadron at Dibby sent to R2077. No enemy aircraft were found but on 25 October No 29 intended the first confirmed night kill by a Ramifighter. Some early night works achieved victories without the Dermogenal radar at it was not until 19 November that an Al-assisted kill was made. In the following six months, radar-equipped Beaufiers destroyed about twelve energy radars.

Simple Beaufighter night fighters were issued to four different squadoms, primarily to test the effectiveness of AI radar. Besides No 29 Squadron, the other units were Nos 25, 219 and 604 Squad Squadators. Later, on September, No 60 Squadron, a specialized night fighter unit, also received its first Beaufier IFs.

The 1000 Beamfighter was completed at Filton on 7 December 1940, and the 200th example followed out in 10 May 1941. By time, the Fabry Aviation "shadow" factory at Sickcoper and the Ministry of Aircraft Production plant at Weston-super-Mane were both producing the Mk I at a steady rate.

Despite the forward location of the engine nacules, the Beaufighter pilot had good all round vision. The control column is in the center with the firing button on the right side of the control column and the brake were mounted on the column below fit. The circular object above the instrument panel is the reflector gun signal.

## Beautifuler Mk IC

Bristed and the RAF now considered other roles for the Beaufighter. A series of day bomber and fighter sorties had begun to take the war to the enemy in occupied Europe and the Beaughter was seen as an ideal long range fighter to hit enemy bases and shipping as far away as Norway.

Long range tanks were tested on a Beaufighter Mk I (8C152) which had its wing guns replaced by fed cells. To assist in navigation on long over-waier flights a tube and instruments were added in the rear position as a IPT bow was fitted in place of the gun camera. A batch of eighty modified "Coastall" Beaufighter Mk is was completed, these aircraft having a fifty gallup Wellington fout that temporarily mounted on the fuselage floor between the non-busy. Standarding for fettless would be ready later.

The Mk IC (the suffix letter standing for Coastal Command) Beaufighters emerged service with No 252 Squadron, being ready for initial operations in the Mkard of 1941. The destructive of a Fw 2000 on 16 April marked the beginning of a long and distinguished career for the Beaufighter in Coastal Command, one that would grow both in scope and in the variety of weapons used targets stacked. No 143 Squadron became the second Coastal Beaufighter unit in June 1941.

So important was the Beaufighter to become in Coastal Command that Bristol adapted the airframe to take various fittings for the singular task of attacking enemy shipping and control to allocate the "c" for Coastal" suffix. Similarly, the "F" suffix was used to denoted all Fisher Command Beaufighters.

The urgent war situation in the Mediterranean led No 252 Squadron to take its Beaufighters to Malita in May of 1941, to be followed by 30% 272 Squadron with Mk IC and Nos 64 and 89 **While the Beaufighter was proving its worth in agreeing, Bristol approved ways to reduce some of its less attractive handling qualities. Twin fires were fitted to this Mk I (92286) in an effort to improve directional stability, but no production in this configuration was undertaken.**

The second test aircraft, R2061, free shortly after which the same power plant installation. The longer coatings for the liquidcooled, in-line engines did nothing to improve the Beaulighter's swing on take-off or directional stability in flight and both Mk II prototypes were experimentally fitted with a table for and radiator to improve handling. A third prototype Beaulighter Mk II joined the Merlin test program, although this aircraft had a short life. On 13 October 1940 the Martingale Rembiton, destroying R2062 in the process.

Despite reports of power handling qualities compared to its radial eng counterpart, a Although Beaulighters were to have had Gritton engines as the main alternative to the Hercules radial, these were all allocated for Naval aircraft. This Mk IIF (T3177) was test flow with Gritton engines before Bristol was obliged to fit Merlin to all Beaulighter Mk II.

## Beaufighter Mk VI

Output of 1.670 bp Bristol Hercules VI engines steadily increased and by late 1941 enough were on hand to initiate production of a much-improved Beaufighter variant, the Mk VI. With the new engines the top speed of the Beaufighter was raised to 333 mph at 15,600 feet, with a crashing speed of 243 mph.

Some minor modifications were made to the airframe, the most obvious external change being the installation of a single Vickers 303 inch K/m in the observers canopy for rearward defense. This filter had to be redesigned and strengthened by framing to take the sign mount, giving both markets were also introduced and the horizontal toll plane was modified with some 12 degree of difficult.

Extra wing fuel tankage (a 50 gallo tank in the strawbour wing gun by and a 24 gallo tank in the port two) gave the Beaufighter Mk VI case of 1.810 miles compared to 1,480 miles for a standard Mk VIE, the F and CMIK settings continuing to denote Beaufighter built for what had become widely divergent roles. On the one hand, Figure 16 Bewas were faster at altitude where the events passed mainly was appreciated, particularly when the airframe was abide- to take the centimeter Al Mk VI or Mk VI radar sets in an elongated "think" nose randome.

On the other hand, Coastal crews wanted performance "on the deck", their shipping attacks taking place at 500 feet or less. Bristol therefore responded to this need by cropping the impellers and locking the blowers of the Hercules VI engine to produce the Hercules XVII. These modified power plants provided a useful performance surge at low levels.

**This Desufigher MK VI of No 404 Squadron crash landed, apparently at Dye, Scotland. The aircraft was ejected up on a pair of massive four wheel dolitics under the main landing gear points to move in to a magnet for repair.**

The first Beaufigher Strike Wing was formed at North Cates in November of 1942, comprising Nos 236, 254 and 143 Spanders. Operations began on 20 November and, although these initial sorties highlighted some problems, on the least of which was that the promised fighter accord failed to appear, the idea had much merit.

Standard Beaufigher Strikes became the first of the type to see widespread service in the India-Burna theater when no 176 Suganto began flying defensive patrols over Calcutra in January of 1943. It was the Japanese who gave the Beuse one of its insisting nickness whereas attacks on ground targets in support of the Allied drive to retake Burns began. The name "Whisting Death," derived from the sound of twin Hercules engines at full throttle, became synonymous with Beaufigher operations.

Among the weapons used by Beaufigher squadons to good effect in the Far East and elsewhere was the simple but deadly airborne rocket. Trials to adapt the Beaufigher VI to carry eight rocket projectile launch ralls under the wings began in September of 1942 with a UFC (El329). Few technical difficulties were found and by April of 1943 Beaufigherites armed with rockets were training with the Coastal Strike Wings.

The early operations from the island of Milan meant that the Mediterranean theater soon became familiar with the Beaufigher's distinctive engine note as the Allies drive the Axis from North Africa. What entered closer to rain at every and ground commanders alike was that it had the range and ammement to reach and destroy virtually any target, When aircraft inevitably crashed for one reason or another, the crew had little fear of coming to additional harm if the pilot made a nice, flat approach. The Beau one proved strong enough to survive a heavy landing and allow the crew to walk away without further harm.

Following the early operations from Milan with Beaufigher MK is the hands of Nos 252 and 272 Quadrons, Nos 227 and 153 Quadrons went operational, firstly from Milan and later, from buses in Algeria, the "old hands" frequently interchanging personnel with the newcomers in a combat zone where everything was in short supply. Nos 603 and 108 Squadrons began Beaufigher ops in 1943. No 108 was a night fighter with which shared nocturnal perception of enemy aircraft with a Flight of No 89 Squadron on Malta.

While it did a fine job on all types of ops, the Beau's fore in the Middle East was ground

The 416th NFS operated from Aligers airfield and the 417th NFS made its home at Tafraoui. Both squadrons began flight operations on 8 August.

As had many British pilots before them, some American pilots found the big Beau a handful to fly. Used to trigger landing gear aircraft, particularly the P-70 on which most of them had trained in the U.S., some individuals had difficulty in allowing for the take-off swing and many Beaufighters were damaged in accidents. Other pilots swerve by the Beau and appreciational its raised construction.

The 12th AAP night fighter cross from relatively little "trader" as far as night intercepts were, the major hard hard round on and numerous blue stripes were made before they all ended up in Italy, so the start of Beaufighter night kills remained modest. In total the four squadrons were infected with thirty-two confirmed juveniles while flying Beaufighters. These broken was: eight for the 414th; eleven for the 416th run for the 416th run for the 417th.

The first Beaufighter victory was a He-115, shot down by Captain Nathaniel Lindsay and Flight Officer Austin of the 415th NFS on 24 July 1943. The last claim was filed by the 417th for a radio 2900 28 December 1944, the Beaufighter crew being lit Lieutenant Malcolm Campbell and Zaletten Robert McCullen. Numerous other enemy aircraft were credit-ed as damaged or "prochinsky", but as was the nature of night fighting in general, many rounds were fired at targets with inconclusive results.

In summary, the USA/Aar association with the Beaufighter was not successful as it might have been: most of the aircraft passed on by the RAF had been considerable service and the airfields used by the squadrons were often far from ideal. It was also true that there was, in 1943, no other type available and the night fighters cut their teeth on the Beau, learning much of value while the warf is.

## Beaufighter TT Mk 10

With the end of the war, numerous RAF combat aircraft were adapted to undertake less aggressive roles, the Beaaufighter being no exception. Towing targets became an important second line task as training of a new generation of airmen began.

Following a prototype installation of a standard "windwind" "owing wind" a Beaafighter MX (NT913), a number of conversions were made to standard airframes. This aircraft flight-tested the winch, set on the port side of the freslee below the observer's position, in May of 1948. In was followed by thirty-four TT Mk 10s, the airframe conversion work being carried out between 1948 and 1950. The TT Mk 10s were flown by five guardrons in the UK, the Middle East and Far East.

## Final Sortie

On 12 May 1960, the final operational sortie by an RAF Beaafighter was flown by TT Mk 10 (RD761) of the Selectar Base Flight at Singapore. This target-towing sortie was the culmination of many hundreds before it, flown by an aircraft that remained reliable and adaptable right to the end.

## Beaufighter Mk XI

To distinguish Beaafighter Mk Xs without tepode release gear, Bristol allocated the aircraft the Mk XI designation and built 163 examples. These aircraft completed the total of 5,562 Beaufighters built in Britain, although the last one, a Mk X, was not rolled out until after the end of the war, on 21 September 1945.

## Beaufighter Mk XII

A final variant of the Beaafighter powered by Hercules 27 engines, the Mk XII, was canceled due mainly to the non-availability of Bendix exubertors. The strengthened wing designed to take two 1,000 bound bombs, originally intended for the Mk XII, was adapted for late production Mk Xs.

**This Beaafighter Mk X (WW338) was one of the trials aircraft which tested the aerial tope-do for the last production models. The aircraft was configured with flame-damper exhausts and doped over common ports.**
## Post War Operations

Although considerable amount of "second line" (Fig. 19 ahead of the Beaughter plot the Second Worth War ended, that event was not quite the end of its combat operations with the RAF. The immediate powers your sans considerable unrest around the world as nationalist groups move to change their former colonial status.

In Malays, Chinese communist importers attempted armed instruction, but the fighting was contained by British troops with extensive air cover from RAF and Commonwealth symptoms flying Operation FIBCOORS sorting 1948 to 1960. The first strike against communist positions was carried out by Beaughter TFX lots of No-4S Squadron on 19 August 1948. Then based at Neopbornne por Colombo in Cyclon, the squadron was obliged to station a detachment of Beaughters at Kualz number to be within one of its targets. With No 84 Squadron at Tengh, Singapore, No 4S Squadron fleew Bentifinger strike stories on a virtual His Executive Te X (W8082) of No 211 Squadron was flow by Warrant Officer Air Withe, DFM and Warrant Officer from Wmno.

## Beautifuler Mk 21

Following the supply of fifty-four Fairey Aviation-built Beaufighter Mk ICs to Australia during 1941/42, one aircraft (A19-2) was modified to take Wright Cyclone 14 GR-2800 engines. This move was made as a safeguard against the limited delivery of Hercules engines from Britain but in the event, enough Bristol engines were slipped to power all the Royal Australian Air Force's Bearagfighters. Although the Cyclone installation was successfully flown, the engine was of larger diameter than the Hercules and would have required considerable modification to the neccludes to maintain the aerodynamic qualities of the Beaughter's wing.

Incorporating the refinements of the British Mk X and designated Beaughter Mk 21, the first Australian-built example (RAAF serial A8-1) was flown on 26 May 1944. Factories at Fishermen's Bend, Melbourne, Massot and Sydney participated in the Beaughter program to complete a total of 364 aircraft by late 1945.

RAAF Beaughter 21s differed from their British counterparts in a number of ways. A larger bulge was installed ahead of the cockpit intended to house a Sperry auto pilot, and four wing guns were fitted instead of six, these being U.S. 50 caller Browning rather than the When Australia considered using U.S. Pratt & Whitney engines on the Mk 21, a single aircraft, A8-2. was modified to accept the new engines. Considerable work led to be done to the cowings since the Pratt & Whitney engines were larger than the Bristol Hercules.

## Overseas Customers

After the war there was a ready market for warplanes in countries needing to modernize their air arms and, although British faced strong competition from the U.S., some valuable revenue was earned in the lean postwar years. The Beaufighter did its bit in this respect, a total of at least fifty-six finding their way abroad, as follows:

In 1948, ten Beaufighter TF Mk Xs were modified back to Mk VIF standards, mainly by removal of the turbo release gear, and sold to the Dominican Military Aviation Corps. The Beaufighters, all of which had behind these names and rocket landmer risk, were given the **The Dominican Republic was among the small number of foreign air forces that flew Beaufighters**. The FAD received ten aircraft, which were numbered 306 to 315. This pair of Beaufighters were the last and are on the ramp at Fillion prior to delivery.

Dominican three-digit serial numbers (306.1 to 315, No 309 previously being RD432).

The Dominican Beaus were used in action at least once when, in company with FAD Mosquito, they attacked the remnants of an abductive Guatem invasion force on 20 June 1949. The aircraft started a wrecked PBY with fifteen would-be invaders aboard which had been forced down with Puerto Pluta the previous day. The Dominican Republic's last three fly-able Beau Beaufigathers were retired from four line service with the single Ecuador de Caraz-Bombrade (fighter-bombar squadron) in June of 1954, the rest having been stripped to provide spares.

## Israel:

During the build-up of the Israeli Defense Force/Air Force in the late 1940s, four Benaffier Xs were among the types used on ground dataset series by No 105 Squadron at least 1940s. These aircraft were part of a batch of six (UK-scri) registered G-AMB to G-AMBO overburd by Fairey Aviation at Ringay and purchased by R. Dickson and partners for a war movie.

One Benaffier enshed in the UK on a ferry flight and one other Benaffier apparently remained in the UK. The other four were from out to arrive in Israel in July of 1948. The Benaffier was one of a number of types that saw action giant Syrian and Egyptian forces during Israel's early flight for independence.

In October 1948, No 103 Squadron lost a Beaufigher to Egyptian Fisk over Iraq-Sweedan. A secondbean was damaged while attacking Egyptian aircraft on the ground at El Arish craft.

The art month, while Israeli ground cross performed minor matches in keeping various objects: the aircraft servicube under the most difficult conditions, the Benaffier apparently disappeared between March and April of 1948. (Dr. Jan Konlierek)

## Portugal:

Fifteen Beaufigher TF Mx Xs were bought for use by the Portuguese naval air arm, the _Farova Aereas du Armada_, and were delivered during March and April of 1945. A further two were delivered in 1946 after being overvalued by Bristol. All of these aircraft came from RAF stocks and were operated from Lisbon's Portela de Sacerven airfield. In 1965, one of ex-Fordeses Beaufighers (RD253) made a welcome return home for display at the RAF Museum.

## Tukey:

The largest export customer for Beaufighers, Turkey, purchased twenty-three Mx Xs in 1946. In 1944, at least nine RAF Beaufigher Mx Xs were transferred to Turkey "in the field", retaining their RAF serials, but having Turkish national insignignign applied.

Ex-Foreva Aereas du Armada ( Portuguese Naval Air Arm) Beaufigher was returned to England during 1965, once restoration was complete the aircraft went on display at the RAF Museum. The Portuguese received a total of fifteen Beaufigathers which were delivered between March and April of 1945. (Dr. Jan Konlierek)

# Bristol Brigand

Brigand TF Mk I

Brigand TF Mk I

###### Abstract

While the Torbesan was an undupupated success, it had numerous drawbacks as a torped fighter, not the least of which was the fact that the crew compartments were separated and a fully equipped navigator's station had not been necessary. Looking to future development of the Beaufighter and its other twin engined types, Bristol put forward a torpedo fighter development based on the Buckingham, which was an intended replacement for the Bleheim.

Designed to Specification H.7/42, the resulting Bristol Type 164 was a three set aircraft powered by Hercules XVII engines, giving it an anticipated performance of 330 mph at sea level at a weight of 25,600 pounds. A single fan and a high set tell plane after the twin fin and rudder unit of the Buckingham were proposed but dropped, as was the name Buscancer. The Type 164 became the Brigand and four prototypes were ordered in April of 1943.

This Bristol Brigand TF (Brigary) carries an overall White finh and is armed with both a torpedo and rockets on zero-length under wing launches. This aircraft was later converted to the Brigand B Mk I standard and later served as the prototype for the T Mk 4.

The Gray and White "Coastast" color scheme accented the Brignand's chunky _baseline_ lines. This Brignand T 1 (RH7548) was on a test flight during 1947. The first eleven Brignand forepohed bombres were later converted to the flight bomber role for service in _regional areas_.

Similar in construction to the Buckingham and using the same jigs for final assembly, the Brignand's most obvious external recognition point was the raised cockpit, although the false-age was on oral cross section and there were many other detail differences between the two aircraft.

The first flight of the prototype Brignand post place on 4 December 1944, this and other prototypes being powered by 2,400 bp Bristol Centrums VII engines. Production Brigands were to standardize on the Centrums 57 with water methanol injection to provide 2,500 bp.

With the war in Europe drawing a close, the Air Ministry's attention turned to the Pacific. Had the war against the Japanese insect into 1946, new types like the Brignand would have seen service with Tieger Force, the RAF contingent to support the invasion of Japan. As it was, the surrender of the Japanese brought about major changes in requirements for RAF military aircraft. Toptedo bounbers were no longer wanted and consequently only eleven Brignand TF MK is were built. In 1946, these machines went to the Air/Sea Weapons Development Unit and No 36 194 and 25 Squadron s of Coastal Command.

Whirdown from service in 1947 for conversion to light bombers, these early Brigands were armed with four 2004 common under the cockpit floor and one 50 caliber machine gun in the rear of the cockpit. Up to sixteen rocks could be carried under the wings and as an alternative to a torpedo, the Brignand could carry mixes or bombs under the fuselge.

Brigand B Mk I

Production of Brigands switched to the B Mk I, similar to the TF I with a revised, thin frame canopy with a bullet-proof windscreen replacing the earlier canopy, and the rear gun was deleted. As light bombers, Brigands entered service with No 84 Squadron at Habbunjsuh,Tara during 1949 and also replaced the Tempets of No 8 Squadron in Adden. In 1950 they replaced the last of the RAF's operational Benifighters flying with No 45 Squadron in Malaya.

For four years (1950-504) Bigras combat missions in Malaya as part of Operation FIBCDO. Using bombs, rockets and guns, they delivered a heavy weight of fire on terrorist camps and lines of communication. A total of 107 Brigand B is were built.

## Brigand Met Mk 3

The Met Mk 3 derivative of the Brigand B I was an unarmed weather reconnaissance model with photographic capability. Only sixteen were built, to be used principally by No 1301 Met Flight operating out of Negombo, Coylen for weather flights over the Indian Ocean.

## Brigand T Mk 4

Fitted with AI radar, nine new Brigand T Mk 4s were built for Operational Conversion Units to train navigators in night operations. The Brigand T 4s were joined by a few examples of the bomber vision which were converted to T 4 configuration to meet RAF training needs in the fire half of the 1950s.

## Brigand T Mk 5

The T Mk 5 differed from the T 4 mark only in the type of AI draft fitted. Training control on the Brigand until March of 1988, when the type was retired from RAF service. A total of 147 Brigands of all marks were built before the production line closed in 1950. Three Brigands were tested by the Pakistan Air Force, but no order was placed.

Combat

To combat the growing commitrist in Maya, the RAF mounted Operation FIBEDOG. Among the air units engaged in the anti-insupert campaign were Nos 45 and 85 squadros, both equipped with Bristol Brigands.

The Brigand was well suited for this type of action since it was heavily armed with four 20mm common, bombs and rockets. Based first out of Kula Lumpur and then out of Tengsh,and replacing the seals whenever particles were found in the fluid. Another problem surfaced with the aircraft's 200km common. Gun gases were building up in the long span blast tubes and were setting off the high explosive shells that made up part of the amminution supply. To solve the problem, the amminution load was cut by half and only ball amminution was carried. A much more serious problem came up when a Brigand crashed after losing an engine. The problem was traced to the propeller. The crashed aircraft had thrown a propeller blade due to corrosion and the unbalanced pepp load then the engine front is moments. Two other aircraft were lost to this type of accident before all propellers were changed. Finally, an aircraft lost a wing during a high speed pull out from a staring run and this accident led to the Brigends being grounded and replaced by de Havilland Sea Hornets.
