The Messerschmitt fit of 1098-1 was structurally very similar to the early prototypes. Its ten lines and compact design made 1 ftad and highly maneuverable. (Author) flights. The entirely new Messerschmitt and Hienkel designs proceedat a slower pace and these prototypes were not rolled-out until May and September of 1935, respectively.

The Andro A70 was a cantilever, low-wing construction with inverted pull-ups, fixed under an open cockpit. To compensate the drag caused by the mainwheel housing, a streamlined silhouette and low structural weight were anticipated. Miscalculations, however, \(\alpha\), resulted in a substantially higher weight than upregulated and, combined with the resultant higher wing loading, handling characteristics suffered greatly. The V1 crashed during early trials and was written off. Two additional prototypes were completed, but by this time the Ar 80 was excluded from the contest.

Fock-Wulfs entry, the FeV 159 was largely based on its successful predecessor, the Fe 86 5385 fiber fiber. The Fe 159387 fiber amplifier, The Fe 159387 noncompiler layout was unisquely combined with a retractable meaterative. It was fit stretchable underdrawing not proved to be the aircrafty (Cabilities held. Extremely complex and not thoroughly tested, the landing gear was subject to altering. During During 15 yrs first finding attempt, the V1 t vs. 392) was damaged beyond repair. The V2 (W. N. 933) suffered from similar shortcomings, and by the time the third prototype (W. N. 1246) was completed, the Fe 15938 was no longer evenly serious consideration as contestant.

Considered an outsider and later come, the Messerschmitt BF 109 was designed in record time to meet the nine restrictions of the competition. The resulting aircraft was a cantilever, low-wing monophine built of light metal. With its oval section monocowage flasing, enclosed cockpit and retractable landing gear, the RF 109 was the epitacenter of modern fighter aircraft technology. The single-year, low-set wing was filled with automatic Handley-grey tape leading sides, an unusual feature for a fighter. The underwater was manually retracted control into the wing. Although it was designed to use the June 210A, to a shortage engines, the V1 was powered, like its main rival, the He 112 V1, by an imported Roll-Roye Kerst, 12cylinder engine. The first test flight proved that a real fighter with excellent hanging qualities was born.

The Heinkel He 112 was inspired by its forementieme He 70 #Hit, and retained the semi-ellip-ellip-local, low-wing and oval-cost, monocowage flasing concept. The wing was slightly filled, and the wing and reshage were built of light metal alloys, patented as Dural and Electro. The stressed skin was flush-twisted. The deep section fusseportal an open cockpit that afforded the pilot good visibility. In contrast to the Messerschmitt fighter, the He 112's wide-track, retractable underdrawing provided safe takeoff and landing characteristics. All these structural advantages, combined with adequate flying performances, placed the He 112 V1 as equal competitor to the RF 109 prototype.

The four contenders competed in trials commenced in October of 1935 at _Erprobungstelle_ (E-Stelle, Test Centre) Rechlin and, later, at Traverninode. It was quickly evident that the **The Ar 80 V2 (D-LOH) was of mixed wood and metal construction, with a fixed underdrawing. Equipped with a Roll-Roye Kerstel V engine, it was considered an outsider from the very beginning. (Pettic)**

Heinkel and BFW designs were far superior to the other entries. In fact, the BF 109 V's top speed was 17 m/b.h.h. (27 km/b) faster than the slightly heavier He 112 V, but the latter present an especially lower wing loading, by 3.525 h/b.h.h. (17.23 kg/h.h.h.) less than that of 109V. In this way, the He 112's wing load was under the prescribed half of 0.2485 h/b.h.h. (100 kg/h), specification, well exceeded by the BF 109. In other areas (flight stability and climb criteria), the two prototypes were evenly matched.

Opinions were deeply divided among members of the Flight Acceptance Commission, who sponsored the contest. As an interim measure, development contracts were awarded in late or before for free-egg carriers aircraft of both designs. Notwithstanding, the He 112 with its excellent hunting qualities remained favored to be the first monopine to see service with the **B**off**ement.

Further test flights were conducted at Travernode until August of 1936 by Laftwaffe and RLM test pilots. Gradually, the pilots opinions slowly topped the scale toward the RF 109. Being commitment applies, the stressed the RF 109s superior aerodite qualities, over such items as ground stability, view from the cockpit while tausing, structural robustness, ease of maintenance, etc.

After a half century, we can speculate what would the outcome have been if the vastly hoped He 112 V9, pattern insert for the 8-0 steps, that bore left if any resemblance to V1, would have been compared to its counterpart, the RF 109 V at the similar RF 109B.

On the final decision, however, was made in mid-1936, not at the RLM but within the inner circles of Filters National Socialist Party, pressed by time to achieve their political goals. The results in favor of the assessment design, easier to manufacture, with a considerable number of to be ready in a record period, crucial to quickly re-equip the _Jaggleeschmark_. In September of 1936, the RLM ordered seventy-six BF 109s for the Luftawife. The Heinkel 112s fade had been sealed.

The Fe 159 2 (D-MAGA) had exceptionally clean lines. Its parsed monopine configura was, however, pass by 1935 and its complex landing gear often failed. (Pettic)**

## Prototypes and Development

In response to a contract submitted by the RLM to all aircraft manufacturers participating in the fighter contest, the _Erst Heinkel Flagenseekorke_ built three prototypes of its competing model, the He 112.

The first prototype, He 112 V1 (_Wekhammer_, or Construction Number 1290), was fitted with a British 695 hB roll-Royee Kestell, MS, 12-5/2 computer, weight, special-cooled engine. The aircraft had been mounted on 15 September 1935, less than eighteen months after the contract was issued. _Flagenkorke_ Gerhard Nitschke, Heinkel's chief test pilot performed the initial evaluation flights at the company's Martenel teent centre. Nitschke was generally satisfied with the prototypes handling characteristics, but it was soon ascertained that dwarfing drag was considerably higher than calculated. The inverted pull wing configuration and excessive large wing tensionalty regime with certain disadvantages as well. Nevertheless, the prototypes overall performance still met and even exceeded the RLM requirements, therefore it received the low-key approach of the test pilots by the keir it.

In December 1935, the He 112 V1, registered as D-1ADO, arrived at the _Exphenbusseltele_ of Tavenanche, where further in-depth tests were conducted. Never before had a German airplane being subjected to such intensive testing. Meanwhile, the second prototype, He 112 V2 (W. N. 291, D-HIG) had been completed. It was used from its 60 November 1935 by Kurt Heinrich, on the Heinkeist of Heinkel's chief test pilots. This aircraft was fitted with the now available 640 he halves ramp 201c mounted-Vee, liquid-cooled engine. Slightly smaller and less powerful than the Roll-Royee Kestell, the Jump 210c offered a more favorable aerodynamic shape than its chulfs predecessor. Except for the German powerhaul, a revised cowling and a tube-based propeller, the early 2\(\times\) was identical with the first prototype.

After pouring over the results of the V1s initial test flights, the Ginter brothers survived that the oversized wing and thick, high-lift airfoil sectioned a serious degradation of performance. They estimated that a reduced wing span and thinner profile will reduce detrimental aerodynamic drag and would increase speed by 15-15 mph (24-28 mph), enough to catch up with their main trial, the bf 109 V5 speed advantage. Therefore, prior submitting the V2 for official testing, the wing was redesigned. The tips were clipped and the wing root filter was straightened. These modifications reduced the overall system by 16.7 307 inches (1.10 meters) and wing area by 17/22 saff (1.60 m). This was, however, a reduction of only 7.8%. The wing loading increased over the 20-485 h/a,fi. (100 kg/m) limit set by the earlier RM specification, from the original 20.475 h/a,fi. (09.95 kg/m) to 20.997 h/a,fi.

**The He 112 V2 was fitted with redesigned shortcut wings. The footprint plant scheme was applied only on the first two He 112 prototypes. The Heinkel Flagenseek's logo was carried on the tip of the fin. The aircraft was tested at Marienehe during late November of 1935. (Pettick)**

* [1]**Only the D-DIMO register reveals that this is, in fact, the He 112 V3. The rebuilt prototype received new wings and tail. The upper section of the fuselage was rounded and an enclosed cockpit with a rear-stiling canopy is fitted. There was a gun sight mounted in front of the windscreen. (Smithsonian Institute) tail surface was enlarged. Brecchi fairings for the intended arrangement, comprising three fuselage-mounted 7.9MM MG 17 machine guns, appeared on the engine cowling and a single exhaust collector who replaced the earlier individual stubs.**

In early 1937 the V3 was assigned by Ernst Heinzl to rocket motor experiments. During one of these tests the experimental device exploded, partially destroying the aircraft. A new airframe with rounded fuselage section and enlarged tail surface was built. The wings were redesigned and an enclosed cockpit was fitted. The aircraft, registered once more D-IDMO, resumed flights, being assigned to various test programs.

## A-Series

The repeated design changes and persistent problems with the Heinzl prototypes had had a negative influence on Commission members. They had already started to consider the BF 109 as an equal partner, if not the favorite. Indeed, a document entitled "BF 109 Priority Procurement", which assesses the decisions made at the RLM meeting held on 12 March 1936, can serve as evidence for the Commission's change of opinion. This document was forwarded to higher political circles where the ultimate decision would rest. Those influential leaders were already warned in June by the _Abwehr_ (German Intelligence) that the British Government had placed a production contract with Supermarine for substantial numbers of Spirifiers. This rather alarming fact combined with the suggestions summarized in the forwarded document eventually settled the outcome of the fighter context.

Nevertheless, the comparison flights at _E-Stelle_ **R**chulin continued, mainly due to certain influential members of the Acceptance Commission, supporters of the Heinzlle design. Their persistence resulted in a production contract being given to BFW and Heinzlle for fifteen reergers aircraft each. According to the _Lifeplan_ (delivery schedule) Nr. 4/ 1.11. 1936, the _Heinzlle Werke_ was to begin delivering two aircraft a month starting in October of 1936 (for

remains uncertain.

In accordance to the _Lieglerian_, deliveries of zero-series continued. In October of 1936, the He 1122A-01 (W.W. 1955, D-LSTM) was rolled out, followed the next month by the A-02 (W.N.r. 1956, D-LSTM). The A-03 (W.r. 1957, D-LSTM) and A-04 (W.r. 1958, D-NEU) were both born in December. The last two A-O3 completed before production shifted to the more advanced B-0-series, where the A-O5 (W.r. 1959) and A-06 (W.r. 1960). These arrival had not been registered in Germany as they were intended for export to Japan as the van-gaunt of the thirty 112s calendar in late 1936.

The employment of these A-O series aircraft were varied. The first aircraft in this production block, the A-O1, was the prototype for the He 1120C- _Tridgerungs_ (carrier aircraft), envisioned to serve with the _Kriegamarine_'s carrier fleet, which eventually never became a reality, came to a quick and spectacular end when it exploded during ground tests with a rock-et motor. The A-O2 was sent to _E-Steller_ Section in late June to take part in the continuing series of evaluation flights. The A-O3 was the show aircraft, being exhibited at the July _Flagleschan_ (air display) at Zurich-Dibendorf (Switzerland) and at the Maland (Milan) _Auxesthen_ (exhibition), Italy, in October. Later, it was assigned to rocket experiments. The A-04 was retained by Heinkel for further development evaluations.

## 6 Rocket Propulsion Experiments

In the late 1920s and early 1930s, various experiments with rockets were carried out throughout Germany. Much of this activity was aimed at the use of rockets as a substitute for long-range heavy artillery, prohibited by the Verwillas Treut. The most intensive and serious of the experiments were conducted at the _Reickswehr_'s (Home Defence Army) Kummendorf-West test site, South of Berlin. It was three that the pioneering work began. Berlin had to be the infamous V1 (Heester F. 163) and V2 (_Aggregat_ of _or _A_) surface-to-surface missiles. The position use of rockets as prime more for aircraft was also conducted here.

As the research work progressed and expanded, the tests use was reflected to a remote peninsula on the Baltic island of Preenemide in April of 1936. There, Dr. Wernher von Braun first conducted his experiments with liquid-feedback rocket motors. In mid-1936, when work had reached the point where a carrier aircraft was needed, von Braun turned to Heinler for assistance. Prof. Ernst Heinkel was a firm support of new ideas that promised advances in technology. He first introduced a _He 2 & Zandler_, later at He 56887 hearing aircraft as flying test beds. During 1937, trials were carried at Neundenberg with a Walter rocket motor mounted in the aircraft's middle section fuselage.

Eventually, as the experiments progressed, the need for a more advanced, high-speed aircraft emerged. Again, Heinkel came through and one of the available pre-series He 112s, the 0.01-m, was quickly placed at two Beams disposal. The liquid oxygen container was installed forward of the cocktail and the methyl-alcohol tank of the diplock's seat. The rocket motor itself was mounted at the extreme end of the redesign at fuselage.

During an early test, the rocket was started by remoteon, and promptly exploded, completely destroying the aircraft. Another Heinkel 112, this time the V3, was made available for testing. This aircraft had the tail enlarged and the fin and stabilize were reinforced with two spacing strips. The rearstage nasse which are unmodified to accommodate the rocket device and the tail-wheel was moved forward some 3 feet 3.37 inches (1 m). After a series of successful ground tests, in early March of 1937 the rocket motor drew He 112 was prepared for its first flight.

_FinefigThe B-Series

Runors that the fighter commission's preference had shifted towards Willy Messerschmarks design reached Ernst Heinkel early in April of 1936. He remained, however, determined to continue his He 112 development program, in the hope that the final decision could still be influenced. At the same time, he realized that substantial changes were needed to improve his own project.

Regardless of the Heinkel _Projekhorse_'s advance on the new construction, in October 1936, the LRM changed its order for the He 112. They instructed the Heinkel plant to finish the A-0 informations already under construction (W.Nr. 1955-1960), then switch to a more advanced version. Thus, the remaining eight pre-production aircraft (W.Nr. 1969, 2001-2005, 2235-2254) were redesigned as He 1128-Os. The new type had very little in common with the old A-series, in fact, the sheer number of design improvements should observe a new name, but Prof. Heinkel finished on the series of aircraft being called the B-series.

The first airframe of the B-series was the He 112 V7 (W.Nr. 1953, D-IKIK), which featured a completely redesigned fatigue and tall, modified engine cowling, air intakes and a new enclosed, high-visibility cookup. Initially, the old style being ving of 38 feet 46.3 inches (11.7 meters) span was retained, but this was later changed to a considerably smaller wing of only 2 feet 9.87 inches (0.99 meters), which became the standard for the B-series. The powerful Daimler-Bern DB 600A/a was retained, but a single piece exhaust collector tube was mounted instead of individual exhaust stacks. The V7s underestimate was similar to the A-0 series and a three-blade variable pitch propeller was fitted. The V7 was rolled out in October of 1936 and test flights continued until April of 1937. It was then handed over to won Braun's team as flying test bed in rocket-motor experiments. Upon completion of this task, in the _The first prototype of the B-0 e-series was the He 112 V7. It was also the first prototype to be fitted with a Daimler-Berna DB 600 series engine rather than a Junkers Jump 210. (Grien)_

Summer of 1937 the D-IKIK was seen at _E-Steffe_ Rechlin. _FISMI_ Heinrich Benavis had from with it again at Eigenshteinne on 26 June, a day after he evaluated the He 112A-02. The last record on the V7 is dated 12 November 1937, when Kurt Heinrich performed a short test. The only A-0 prototype which was re-enigned with the powerful Daimler-Berna DB 600A/a engine was the V8. During 1938, It was sent to Spain to be evaluated under combat conditions. (Grien)_

## Sales Attempts

One childly early morning in late 1937, the He 112 V9 took off from the Heinkel's Marienehe site for another demonstration flight. This time the spectator was _Generalmajor_ Ernst Uder, director of the RLMS _Techniches Ant_, an influential man in German aviation circles and a long time friend and supporter of Prof. Heinkel.

In spite of the prototype's perfect performance, that left the distinguished onolocker impressed, he already knew the bad news he had to tell hisfriend, the fate of the He 112 had been decided, the RLM already ordered a batch of seventy-six BI 1098 _Jager_ from the _Bayerne_ Heritage (BFW).

Heinkel was disappointed. He was convinced that this order belonged to him and, in compliance, a series production line had already been projected. Even the _Werknummum_ were already reserved for this batch (W.N., 2001-2080). Nevertheless, to compensate the bad news, ICRP thought not news, too. He informed Heinkel that experts of his figure were welcomed and permission would be granted for export licenses. Ernst Heinkel immediately initiated an intensive sales campaign throughout Europe and even further, in the far East.

The first customers were not long in coming. In January of 1938 the _Heinkel Fluggework_ officially asked permission from the RLM to export the He 1128 to two _Friedspy_ countries: Austria and Japan. Uder kept his word and the necessary papers arrived at Rostock at the end of January. By the time the paper work had arrived, steps for a limited scale production run at the Marhehehe achesity in land already been set in motion.

The first customers were the Japanese. They sought fat first intercept capable of combining the new Soviet aircraft encountered over China. Impressed the qualities of the He 112 V9 demonstrated to them, the Japanese delegation promptly placed on order for thirty similar of the 112Bs, with an option for 100 more. The first four He 112s left Germany in December of 1937, and during the next year all thirty aircraft reached Japan.

The Japanese were followed in November of 1937 by an Austrian military delegation, led by _Generalubert_ Alexander Lohr, Commander-in-Chief of the _Laftwitekaffe_ (Austrian Air

Force). They placed an even larger order for a total of forty-two He 112Bs [according to an Austrian document entitled _Sondergezweitse-Ausfringhe 112_ (Special Equipment for the He 112) and 20 November 1937, the Heinkel fighter would be armed with two Heinkemantel MG 17 (D-200) machine runs and six THMI (101 bomb shackles and the 2004n Griffith commes were pending to license purchase from the manufacturer.) These Heinkel figures received Austrian air force markings (D01-1042) before their delivery. During early 1938, the Austrian reduced the order to thirty-six aircraft to look off funds (the price for one He 1128 was 163.278 _Retickmarks_, while for a spare Juno 210 engine of 31,533 RM). In the event, these Heinkels were reached Austria, since the country was incorporated into the Third Reich following the March 1938 _Anesthesia_.

Now Heinkel found himself in trouble since the Austrian order was subsequently uncovered by funding. Luckily, another customer showed up. Spain. The presented results demonstrated by the three Heinkel prototypes sent for combat evaluation in Spain, the _Axideidean_ [Spanish Air Force] decided to purchase this fighter. Accordingly, during early 1938, they placed an order for twelve Heinkel 112Bs, the total number later increasing to eighteen. Unexpectedly, in the Spring of 1938, the LAnother country targeted by Heinkel was the Netherlands. The _Luchnaverfolding_ (Durch Air Force) wanted to purchase thirty-six interceptor fighters to equip two of its squadrons. The He 112B-1, D-IORC (W.N.T. 2029), had arrived at Soeesterberg base on 12 July 1938, piled by Nurt Heinrich. Next day, glamper trials were held at the range situated on the Vileand Island. Two Dutch fighters, Ist Lieutenant G.W. de Zwan and Sergent Major D.H. Lamberment, were allowed by the fighter. Although both of them reported favorably about the He 112, which exceeded the _Luchnaverfolding_ specification, the Dutch Minister of Defense, van Dijk, decided the Kochowren FK-58. Additionally, the Hawker Hurricane had also been ordered, mainly due to its availability for immediate alignment (the He 112A were promised for late 1939, in two versions, equipped with either the Junon 210 Ea or DB 601A engine). Similarly, Switzerland rejected the purchase he the He 112, instead of selecting the He 109. Belgium and Turkey opted for the Hawker Hurricane. In April of 1937,-Vugoslavia worked for thirty He 112A, but later cancelled it and instead purchased a license to produce the other two fighter types.

Suspended by hostile countries, each claiming, more or less founded, a piece of her territory, Runania was the country most desperate to procute military equipment. The _Aeronunciation Equal_ (Runania Air Force) wanted virtually everything that fleve. In April of 1939, an order substituted for twenty-four He 112B, this soon being raised to thirty aircraft. In addition, they succeeded in obtaining a number of Hawker Hurricians and BT 109Es as well. The first Heinkels reached Runania in June of 1939, with the last one arriving in the _L_est country to receive the He 112A was Hungary. In June of 1938, three Hungarian publios were sent to Relinado with the He 112A 20. On 7 September 1938, the _Magger Khordi Headerig_ (Hungarian Air Force) placed an order for thirty-six He 112B, and expressed the willingness to purchase a license to indigenous production of the He 112. The order was also observed several times, ultimately, only three He 12B-1/2-UNes realized Hungary. The license agreement was also refused by the R.M. As a consequence, Hungary turned to Italy and chose the Fate CR-2 and Reggae Re-2000 as its standard fighters.

The DB 600A-equipped prototype, the V11, intended to be pattern aircraft for the planned He 112C 00Ar-eircraft series, was finally sent to an iron instead of Hungary.

The first series-production to 112B-1/DEFF, W.N.T. 2005, took part in a Finnish aviation exhibition in May 1938. The Heinkel Werrey is quiet, Schutz-Beltank, runs the engine prior to test off on a demonstration flight from Maini airport on 23 May 1938. The Stonner Infirmovari (Finish Air Force) aircraft in the background carries the _Hakairi_, a Light Blue Srasthee on its wing.

**Into the Luftawaffe**

Following the _Aeschakness of_ March 1993, when Austria was incorporated into the Third Reich, German expansion next targeted the Western part of Czechowalexia. This region, known as the _Suddenness_, was inhabited by a majority of ethnic Germans, who demanded reminification with Germany. This time, however, the take over old not lock to be as easy as the previous anneatations. Both France and Great Britain had expressed their concerns and the Soviet Union threatened armed interference.

Fearing a confrontation, the RIM ordered the impression of all serviceable military aircraft as a slow strength and to reinforce the Luftawaffe in case of need (as of 1 August 1938, of the 2.928 German military aircraft even 643 were figures [22%]). Among the mobilized warplanes were a limited number (different sources give the total number usually as twelve, sometimes ten, or even eighteen) of Heinkel 112Bs from the batch completed for Japan. These figures were assigned in July 1938 to the recently formed /J/G 132. The Hercules formed this fourth _Grupze_ (group), with a strength equal to only a _Sudden_ (guidance). These He 112s received two different camouflage schemes: at least six of them were painted in Olive and Black Green over Light Blue, while others related their overall Light Gray contrast. Initially modern images were single-digit numbers, beginning with 1, these being painted either in Yellow (on Green), or in Black (on Gray). No group or squadron embles were used.

IV-J/G 132 was established within _LafWorks II_ at Wrenecuech on 1 July 1938. Initially, its base was at Oschutz, moving to Karlshoff on October. From three of which-Tribano-Tribano became November, where it was redesignated I/G 331. As short time later, the He 112s were returned to Heinkel, being replaced by Bf 105. Once released, these He 112B-1s were shipped to **A line-up of six He 112B assigned in July 1938 to **V/A/G 132 based of Oschutz, individual marking (instarted numbers) have not been applied.

## Foreign Service

### Japan

When the second Sino-Japanese War erupted in July of 1937, combat aviation became an important strategic and tactical weapon, employed on an unprecedented scale. Both sides used aircraft en-masse and many new types made their debut in the sieves over China. To counteract the higher performance of the new Soviet gighters that Japanese airrows were encountering, the _Teibuka Nixon Kuipers_ (Imperial Japanese Navy, INB) began looking for an interceptor capable of effectively countering the new Soviet machines. As the Minukshi ASM was only available in limited numbers and the AGM Zero, was still under development, a fast fighter became a pressing need. To overcome this, Japan turned to its major ally, the Third Reich.

In the autumn of 1937, a Japanese military delegator visited the _Heitchel Flageagework_'s Marteing plant. Impsesed by the high performances and clean lines of the He 112 W/s, an order for thirty similar He 1128-bus was placed, with options for a further 100 aircraft. The delegator returned to Japan, not only with the speed contract documents but with a demonstration aircraft, presumably the He 112 V5 -O/HEO.

The Heitchel 112 fighter entered in the inventory of the INN as the A7HeHeithel Navy Type Heitecopter fighter the INN designation gives the following information: At at the time indicated fighter, 7.1 indicated that in (1938) the aircraft was intended as replacement for the type 6. i.e. the AGM Zero (the ATM _Repay_, Allied code Sam, because the plane-of-code to replace the Zero). He is the designation for the manufacturer and 1 indicated the first sub-variant of this type) and was assigned to the INN Air Marsh for evaluation (torator some sources, there is no official record indicating that He 112 was operational use in China for field evaluation.) These tests included comparison flights with all similar aircraft levels capable. Compared with the Minukshi ASM2, the current Japanese Navy front-line fighter, the He 112 proved to be 40 mph (65 km/h) faster. Climb rate was almost identical but the maneuver.

The aircraft carried the standard Luftwaffe splinter camouflage used in the late 1930s of Black Green (RLM 70) and Dark Green (RLM 71) over Light Blue (RLM 65) and the older-style tail markings. Later (from 1939) the Red stripe and White circle were deleted while the swastika was retained.

It was fitted with a more powerful engine suitable for higher altitudes, heavier armament, oxygen supply, radio equipment, etc. It was called by the Republicans _Nariz,fia_ (Cold Novel), but there is no incontrovertible evidence of this incident. In the following days, the main role of the He 112s was tactical reconnaissance, in addition to low level attacks against the retreeting enemy forces, During this final period of the civil war, the Republican fibers were rarely seen, allowing the Nationiscal aircraft to complete their missions undisturbed. 23 January saw the Heinkels working in parts to provide an cover for the _"Float Nacional"_ (National Navy), forty miles off-shore.

These late flights allowed the pilots to experience the first 109s, more favorable engine power/airframe ratio. The Heinkel pilots, used their heavier aircraft, were pleased with the better maneuverability of the BI 109, but still considered the Heinkel to be more adequately armed and safer during tachycardia and landings.

This series of rather unevent encounters ended on 3 March 1943, when the most serious incident involving Spanish and U.S. aircraft took place. On that morning, infantry observation posts along the Moroccan-Algarten frontier reported a large formation of aircraft flying into Spanish airspace from the East. The commander of the 27th Group immediately ordered the alert fighter to scramath and intercept the enemy formation.

The _Sierefide de Mive_ is inventory list for 1952 mentions two He 112Bs, one still in flying condition and the other one grounded due to technical problems. The 1953 inventory fails to list any Heintel 112Bs.

All three Heirls were assigned to the _Republic Kskeletal Intlact_, where in the following year they participated in comparison tests against various aircraft in MNH. service. In May of 1940, the Heirls were evaluated against the new Register Re-2000 _Haiai_, which was to become the standard fighter of the Hungarian air force during the early stages of the war.

On 30 March 1999, a new seed record was set by the He 100 vs, dubbed for propagation reasons "He 1120" to gain precise for the He 112 intended to be exported. Upon learning of this superior fighter, the Hampins decided to manufacture the new He 1120 in place of the planned He 1125. The "U-" model was intended to be powered either with the June 211A and DB 601A engine. Again, a sample aircraft was promised by the Heirls plant but never delivered to Hungary.

In August 1939, the Commander-in-Chief of the MNH, **Ezredes** (Colent) Lis20Hay, a veteran pilot of the First World War, recommended the Heirls 112 as the standard Hungarian fighter. Nevertheless, negotiations with the RIM had reached a dead by the end of September 1939, and with the water already under way, the RIM broke the export any sample aircraft. Simultaneously, the shipment of the promised Jump 211A and DB 601A engines, sorely needed for the Hampins's water also prohibited. Keep with this situation, in 11 October, the _Hadiymisintegration_ ordered a halt to the tooling up for He 112 series-production at the Weiss Mantfield plant. Instead, an indigenous fighter project, based largely on the He 112, was initiated. This project evolved into the W.M.-3 _Essar Bank_/_Siber Arrow_. The license agreement between the Heirlsel Werke and Weiss Mantfield RL was canceled by the Hungarians in December of 1939.

After the completion of their testing period at the RKI, the three Hungarian He 112B-1s were assigned to different fighter units. On 1 June 1940, they were transferred to the 2.

The missions followed one after the Heiliscus successfully attacking front-line airfields, which were usually the first targets of the day, being started just before dawn. Later in the day, forward enemy positions, military columns, AFV concentrations, trains and artillery placements were regularly hit with common fire and small-caliber bombs. Rarely were the Heiliscus used in air cover series.

These successes, however, claimed a heavy toll. On the second day of fighting, while attacking Bglard airfield, aircraft No. 12 was finally hit by Soviet fighters, forcing its pilot _Adjature_ Anghel Coort to ball over our enemy priority. He was never heard from again. The next day, two Heiliscus were involved in accidents and were rendered userside. One of these was plotted by _Lucotement commanderinator_ (Major) Gheorghe Miclescu, commander of the 5th Fighter Group.
