The top forward gunter was to list at a turut with 37 mm, guns, while another sun turned out be lowered from a bay beneath him. For 50: SOLer only were to be mounted in the upper ear turner, which was remotely-controlled by gunters sighting from blisters in the rear compartment.

The specifications established by June 1943 called for the heaviest bomber ear built, with a 12.643 lG, twenty weight and 265 lG, 12.69 sB, and then carrying 11 mm, twenty 800 lG, bonus, and the 18.89 sB of that needed to 400 lG, 100 lEng.

The performance was compared as goals with increased and doing with those on (4800-8000), as usual 1956 modifications projected to goods of 282 mB at sea and 367 mB at 30.000 lG. Combining increases in length up to future project decreases in performance.

Enthusiasm for the big-beg project fluctuated with the furufines of war. At first, 824 production slotted shipped of experienced personnel and priorities. In September 1942, General Arnold entered the highest priority to both the X3-86 and X3-86 became Japanese successive once more likely the need for burdens that could try access the whole Pacific Ocean. Responding to Courier's complaints for the Secretary of War that was difficult to get autostructures for an order to run today that is, "a lot of intent" for 100 03-63 was issued on _ay_, 1943, Still, now be a year before a contract was signed and the war would end before the 360 became a night priority request.

Jagers' surrender in 1943 sharply contained aircraft production in the United States, but had the opposite effect on the 8-86 program. The appearance of the automatic motion, as well as the tremendous cost of capturing island bases for shorter ranged 2.98, convinced the

Air Force it needed a truly intercontinental bomer. Cancellation of B-32 production on August 15, 1945 finally gave the B-38 the personnel and attention it needed.

The country celebrated V3 Day on September 2, 1945, and six days later, the X30-36 was wheeled out of the Experimental Hander on its own landing gear. Energies arrived at a rate time, along with other final components and an June 12, 1948, that first engine unp tests were begun. On one of these tests, the wing flats digitized in the heavy propeller turbulence. The flats-covered magnesium alloys had to be replaced by stronger ones of aluminium, as time heavier, moving energy flux. Test less began on July 21, and on August 19, 1946, the X30-38 was ready for its first flight, nearly five years after it was detected. The aircraft used eight 2000,000s, with 8000 planets of total, and nine crewmen, including plight flats04 E, Erickson. The X30-36 filled out of it0:10 AM for a cautious 37 minute multi-shot flight.

This and further test lights soon showed that many mechanical difficulties would have to overcome before the shorter arrival would be ready for service. Unique in this case and design, the X30 was at the very frontier of "the state of the art". For example, the engine code in the system was inadequate, and all the prototype reached 30,000. It was unable to maintain high-altitude flight at better cooling can could be developed. Project vibrate, for seriously published using the wing and engine structure and many points had to be strengthened. One a popular brute loose at 19,000 ft. and another time all three engines on one side will octave a vibration induced failure at the electrical system in the wing.

The prototype was warmed. For the production aircraft the Air Force had finally decided on an arrangement of sixteen 20 mm, guns, paired in eight remotely-controlled turntes, one of them in the nose. Making on them to meet further causes a redesign of the flight code. Simultaneously a bubbling convey away for the flight, coplit, and flight flight engine, planner them would be straightly. At least-case cabin mode had been built in the 1945 and the new canopy was specified for the second prototype and all production aircraft. The prototype's large single man mania wheels, 10 inches in diameter, were the largest aircraft wheels were made, but they required a 22% inch thick. At the contrary, thus limiting the prototype to work they specially strengthened runways: those at Ford Worth, Egini Air Force Base and Fairfilt-Sustain (thatera Travis AFB). While the safety disadvantages were apparent, a multi-walled guard can be obtained until adequate brakes could be designed. Finally, a four-meter gear using 56 inch diameter thus was parked out. The R34, 33.5 inch As an experiment, the X8-38 was fitted with a track-type landing gear. This did indeed reduce ground course significantly, but was never seriously considered for service use. March 26, 1956. (00)

By 1950, the process of distinguishing between the two Groups at Caravell included identification inserts inside the A triangle. Th.20th/Pencil used a 4-inch cut for visual inspection. Note that the two methods used in the shell are the same.

B-36C

As early as December 1984, SAC Commander George C. Kenney suggested that the 100 plane B-36A order be canceled, and only several test aircraft be completed. It favored the latter Boeing B-50 as the standard SAC bomber until it ispropelled B-4's became available. Attem to achieve built timing range, the left time, made the B-36 too big and too big. Also, strategic topening operations would require advanced SAC on radar reiterling, increasing the true-target speed seemed to Courant to be the greatest improvement head-el, and an answer was offered by default'shouy's development of a variable Discharge Turbine (VOT) version of their R-430 engine. In March 1984, Converica proposed a VOT-powered 30B approach operated to reach 410 mph and a 45,000, for exercise. The new engines for commission, however, would require changing the paney bpe arrangement to tractor. The engines would be served, turning propeller with extending toward test head of the leading edge. Development of this idea led to the B-36C design, which was relatively approved for prototype conversion duty to 19, 1947.

Converica on September 4, 1984 that said at termination with VOT engines as the B-36C-, with the additional expense being met by reducing the total B-36 contract to 59. This paney renewed the approval of most AC Force officials, except General Kenney, and the Air Material Council (AMC) was affected to be ahead on December 4.

By April 1984, however, VOT design development had run into many difficulties.

Gravidly in December after the B-36C- would be slowed down by the B-36C. After now recommended cancellation of the VOT project and the B-36C-, The whole B-36 program in the phone with the SAC had yet to receive its first B-36A.

Converica officials quickly got together the improved performance data learned from the B-36A tests, and anticipated that the B-36A-based, and presented this information to all Force Secretary Smart Simulation in May 1984. In that period the CoIR war reached new heights of tension. On the morning of June 24,1984, all traffic into Berlin was strongly flipped by Soviet blockade that was to last ever ten months.

The idea of building a transport version of the 93-94 came early. Conaxial had drawings on May 20, 1942 of a passenger version using the 230 ft. using and twin nudges then plan-set of the MX-383, on December 31, 1942, the Air Force ordered a prototype cap plane designated XC-99, a 352-3626. Wartime priorities kept development at a slow pace, but by 1944 the design, Conaxial load, 37, ahead real definitive form, with the same as 30,000 mg.

A360-25 engines, and head head gear on the completed X38.X. New was the largest testing ever mode for a language, a double-decay prescribed structure 1829F long with a 15,710 ft. of a lengthy 60 tons of cargo or 600 troops. Height of the fuselage alone was 2057. Weight was calculated at 1352.120 s. 20,000 and 2650,000 ft. gross.

In our work on 1000, 25,000 gd. and ten extreme was estimated at 17,200 miles, while a 100,000 ft. load and 91,120 gallous could be earned to 18,000 miles. Cruigend was 200 and no good was used as 31 m 00,000 ft.

The wings were made in Fort Worth and aligned to San Diego where the fuselage was constructed and the XC-98 now completed. On November 24, 1947, and made her first flight from Lubbey Field, San Diego, the world a target lapaltime. After successful tests, the XC-98 was modified in Fort Worth to the standard four-wheel tandem gear and 3,500 ft. A360-450 ft entry reduction 93.8%, the full 1000,000 ft. load was fitted for the first run on April 1942, 1944 and Fort Worth, setting an introduction of world's record. The XC-98 was officially delivered by Carswell AFB on May 26, 1948, and in September, 1950 transferred to Kelly AFB.

During the Korean AFB, the XC-98 was used to test usa to map to the West Coast. It reached the 6,000 lunar trail as July 1962, and regular weekly runs added up the total to 17,000 hours by the time of the last flight in March 1957. Actually, the XC-98 and a lower cost per ton-time, when it varied, that other aircraft. However, at that time, there was seldom enough cargo to make operations economical. Pan American Arrows had an option for these in 1948 for their Hawai, but dropped the program when it became apparent there was no telenougd traffic to make the type profitable.

## NB-36H

The first plane to carry an operating nuclear reactor in flight resulted from a Convair program in 1954 with the first AI Force contract to develop auchouse-operated aircraft. The Mercatori Nuclear Program itself was cancelled early in 1954, when it appeared unlikely to produce a military used aircraft in the foreseeable future, but not before the NB-36H had been foresee. Only 1955, 36-36-420, 57-122, was assigned to test airborne shielding of erroneous and equipment with a small nuclear reactor. The flight error comparison was completed, shielded from radiation that the subdivision of leaded was was up to 14% thick and was about 6% in flight that pilots at about 10% thick. Closed circuit television systems gave the ephemers in front visual back on the districts set engines and reactor controls. The reactor did not power the aircraft itself, but was used to test radiation effects on the NB-36H itself. Forty-seven flights were made from September 17, 1955 to March 28, 1967.
