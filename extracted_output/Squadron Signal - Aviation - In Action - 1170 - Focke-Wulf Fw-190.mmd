## Introduction

In September of 1941, mysterious, sub-based Littlewaffe fighters skaded a claim to the skies over Dunkirk. Seizing control of the air from Britain's Spiffre Mk-V, these new fighters maintained a near strangledled over Allied airport unveiled the summer of the next year. This new fighter, the Fw 1990, which had been agreed to by the _Lafroffle's_ RLM (_Reichslift/Mainitarian_Static Aviation Ministry) as a'supplemental' fighter to the already proven Messechmitt Bt (109), and instead demonstrated qualities which were arguably superior - string - a debate which has outlived World War Two itself. Without question, however, the Fw 1990 would become a critical factor in Germany's very survival during those tensile years of conflict, and still remains the most historically significant aircraft produced by the Fock-Wolf Fluggewabu, G.M.B.H. and is chief designer, _Diplon Ingenier_ (Dipl. Ing - Electrical Engineering - later Professor) Kurt Waldemar Task. By the end of hostillites, on May 1945, Germany's mystery fighter had become for the Aliles an all to common sight on every raw front, and within the five years of war had been manufactured in numbers estimated at roughly 20,000 machines.

Originally, when the RLM requested design submissions for a 'back-up' fighter to the BF109 in the 1937, Kurt Tank's response was regarded with skepticism for two reasons. First, he had in the 1937, Kurt Tank's response was regarded with skepticism for two reasons. First, he had in the 1937, a polyester at superior respiratory fighter at a time when Germany's warlames were transferred by purely offensive, tactical combat machines for rapid request. Secondly, Tank intended to power his design with an air-ocold model engine, this being an affront to technical advisors who felt that only an in-line, liquid-cooled engine provided the needed horse power and aerodynamic design potential to suit the Lafroffle's needs. Nevertheless, the RLM was intrigued by a fighter which would not further tax the foreseen demand for in-line engines and, by Tank's own assurance, could be easily produced by many sub-contractors. Subsequently, Tank was given the go ahead for project development, and the first technical drawings were prepared by Fock-Wolf's well organized draeguinedness by July of 1938.

The aircraft, designated the Fock-Wolf's Fw 190, was a low-wing monoplane of all metal construction with fabric covered control surfaces. The pilot's cockpit was located close to the engine firewall and covered with a nearly all transient, raverar sliding canopy which blends and into the contours of the fusethge spine and provided excellent AI control system. Also, the Fw 190 was to be supported by ootboard mounted wide track undercarriage legs with a total wheel of 35,000mm (11.5 feet). Each inward rectangle bearing was electrically powered by separate motors, and ultimately proved to be extremely sturds, despite its high-tilt appearance.

Power was to be provided by a twin row, eighteen cylinder, 1,550 hPM 139 radial engine, produced by the Bayreichest Moreen Werke, driving a three blunder VDMAI metal propeller. Engine cooling was to have been maintained by a multi-blacked, compression producing fan at the mouth of the cowling, but due to delays with the fan's development, the first prototype was designed with a bullet shaped ducted spinner, which would create problems later.

The originally proposed armament (not fitted on the first prototype) was to be four synchronized making guns (two 7.9mm MG 17 machine guns and two 13mm MG 131 machine guns), or each to be mounted in each wing.

For ease of serving the new fighter, Kurt Tank's design team incorporated a system of aligned panels which would easily expose every critical maintenance area, particularly the armament and powerful. The panels themselves could be completely detached if needed. Completed by the spring of 1939, the **Fw 190V-I** exemplified the clean, compact appearance which the Fw 190 would maintain throughout its life. In keeping with the practice of the time, the prototype was finished in a camouflage of Black Green (RLM 70) and Dark Green (RLM 71)'spinter' pattern on the upper surfaces, over Light Blue (RLM 65) under surfaces. A black swakia on a white ice on red and banner spanned the vertical tail, while the fuselage code, D-OPZE, was painted in glossy Black's.

The first flight of Fw 190V-I took place on 1 June 1939 with Fock-Wolf chief test pilot, Hans Sander, being given the honor. Sander literally loved the handling displayed by the Fw 190, describing the aircraft's performance as _"delightful"_ and light on the controls. Less delightful, however, was the tremendous amount of exhaust fumes and heat that filled the cockpit, splitting Sandry with temperatures up to 130 degrees Fahrenhett The RLM was pleased with the initial flight results, and development was allowed to proceed.

While metal was cut on a family of Fw 190 prototypes, flight testing of the Fw 190V-I continued into the autumn of 1939, when it was transferred to the _Erybornes_(E-Slele Testing Center) at Rochlin. Ultimately, the V-I was fitted with its 10 bladed cooling in along with the detector spinter, but since the 'bullet most' spinter offered no substantial improvement in performance, the prototype was provided with a conventional spinter. In flight tests, the Fw 190V-I was able to achieve a respectable speed of 594 km/s (639 mph), although engine over heating continued to be a problem. The Fw 190V-I, later coded W+FOLY, "The German _Reichslift/Mainitarian_ (RLM) also established a set of standards for co-ofs and markings used on Lafroffle aircraft. German aircraft manufacturers were to adhere to a set of standard colors that were to be used on all German military aircraft. Each of the colors was assigned a name, e.g. _Erybornzem_, and a number, e.g. RLM 70. The Fw 190V-I was officially painted in RLM 70 _Schwartzgm_ and RLM 71 _Dankelgram_ on the upper surfaces, and RLM 65 _Hellow_ on the lower surfaces.

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:6]

engine cooling fan, now equipped with 12 blades, provided at for both the engine cylinder and the annular oil cooler and storage tank within the main forward coil ring containing 55 litres (14.52 gallons) of lubricant. The two main fuselose fuel tanks (excluding containing a sealed electrical pump) were located in a boxed compartment below the plot's floor board, and accessible through movable ventual fuselose panels. The forward tank contained 232 litres (61.2 gallons) of fuel and the main rear tank contained 300 litres (79.52 gallons) of fuel, later adjusted to 292 litres (77 gallons) on subsequent output variants. The oxygen supply was located in the 4th fuselose, contained in three stacks of ni-spherical steel bottles.

During tests, difficulties were encountered with release of the plot's canopy for emergency buli-out above 250 mph, resulting in the installation of a jetinating cartridge in the art canopy. This was triggered by striking a lever above the canopy crack handle, located on the standard side of the cockjet. On the port side of the fuselose, a tubular, retractable foot step and hatch covered hand-holds allowed the plot to more easily board his machine.

When retracting or extending the macrocharge, the plot was able to ascertain the position of his landing gear by observing a small red and white sealed indicator bin with which projected through the wing upper surface just above each landing gear start. Although the main gear was electrically operated, the tail gear was activated by a system of cables and pulleys connected to the main undercattering and split upwards into its well along an angled rack. Maintenance access to the tail retraction mechanism was provided by a triangular flugged panel on the port side of the vertical tail fin. Standard tire dimensions remained the same throughout the Fu 190's career, the main wires being 700x175mm and the tail wheel being 350x135mm.

The plot's stick and holder controls were a pushful roll and cable type, with differential helmarks to smooth control of the rauder and elevators at higher speeds. Activation of the hydraulic braking system was achieved by the plot's ice pressure on the rauder pedalis.

machines were finished in overall Gray (RLM 02), the Fw 190A-A-8 being prepared for service trials carried the standard day fighter camouflage of Gray Green (RLM 74) and Gray Vibdet (RLM 75) splinar on the upper surfaces over Light Blue (RLM 76)* underlies. The adjustable pitch VDM 9 metal propellers and spinners were normally finished in Black Green (RLM 70).

As preparations for full scale manufacturing continued, arrangements were made to form a transit unit at the _E-Sellet_ at Rechlin, alternately referred to as _Eprolongness_ liquid 190 (Testing Squadron 190). In order to introduce the Fw 190 to combat pilots and create a pool of experiences personnel for further orientation, select pilots and groundwave of 'I' _Gmpegrograde/Broadbox_' _B-C3oker_ were transferred from their base in Belgium to Rechlin in early 1941. By March of that year, the enthusiastic pilots were testing pre-potation for Fw 190A-0 aircraft, and some of the first proton series Fw 190A-1s at similarated service conditions. Although some troublesome problems began to surface, the Fw 190 was absent to embark on its overall center.

Meanwhile, guided by the Encious planning of Kurt Tank, a system of sub-contractors for Fw 190 production had been established. Among the many facilities which would ultimately participate in this massive effort (including a number of "shadow factories" in German occupation controllers), the main complexes had been looked up at radio (Warmenmide), AGO (Oschelleben), and later, Fiesiek (Kassel). These companies, together with the parent Keck-Watt facility, would be joined by smaller contracts devoted to conversion work and repair as the war demanded.

* The official designation for RLM 76 was _Lichblaus_. Although both RLM 65 _Lichblaus_ and RLM 76 _Lichblaus_ both translate into English as 'Light Blue' the two colors were different--RLM 76 having more of a lighter gray tin.

* A number of Fw 190A-0s were whitheld for testing _Umniat-Basuflage_ (Factory Conversion sets). This overall RLM Gray A-0 has been fitted with a fuselage bomb load and appears to be updated with a forward cost ring line the latter production for Fw 190A-1 (VFW-Fokker).

Among the problems plaguing the Fw 1904-0 and A-1 during service orientation was engine overheating and fires, almost leading to the cancellation of the Fw 190 program. Cooling slots behind the cow was part of the solution.

Despite being powered by a radial engine the sieek clean lines of the Fw 1904-1 are evident in W/M 033 rid1 flugugge/d 26., _agagglechnechnwar_ 25 was the first unit to take the Fw 190 into combat, scoring three victories on 1 September 1941, with no losses.

W/M 027 receives fuel in one of its two strawdenfuselage filling points. Just behind the mechanic is the oxygen filling point and the first and panel is partially covered by the Balankenzoan. One of the nearest support rods under the canopy is bent.

## 0.6 Fw 190A-2

Essentially similar to the A-1 in appearance the Fw 190A-2's most distinguishing characteristic was the installation of two belt fed Mauser MG 151/2062 20mm cannons in the wing roots, replacing the 7,92mm MG 17 machine guns. To clear the larger common breches, bulged doors were added to the upper wing root ornament hachets, a feature the Fw 190 would retain for the remainder of its development. The fuselance mounted MG 17 machine guns were retinned, as were the outboard MG FF exmons, however, the MG FF exmons were frequently removed to reduce weight and increase speed with pilots relying on the faster firing, more accurate MG 151ks.

Like the Fw 190A-1, those Fw 190A-2s equipped with a BMW 801D engine featured cooling jobs behind the engine cooling. In detail, the pilot's airport sanded head-rest was now supported by a single flat knee, although a number of A-2s were still equipped with the dual rod head-rest braces. Again, an Fw 25 IFF radio could be installed, with its ventral'ship' aerial in the same location.

Specifications of the BMW 801C equipped Fw 190A-1 and A-2 were comparable, with a maximum speed of 590 km/h (366.6 mph), a range of 1030 kilometers (640 miles) and an average loaded weight of 3400 kilometers (7495 pounds). With installation of the BMW 801D-1 or D-2 power-weight, weight was increased by roughly 600 pounds, and range being reduced by as much as 100 plus miles. Still, these decrements were offset by a respectable speed increase of 20-40 mph.

Enering production in August of 1941, the Fw 190A-2s joined the troubled Fw 190A-1s in combat service during the autumn of that year: Along with _JG_ 26, other units employing the Fw 1900 method led _JG_ 1, _JG_ 2 and _JG_ 5, _JG_ 28 was entirely converted to the Fw 190 by early 1942. Fortunately the Fw 190A-2s. Defited by having the emergency modifications of the A-/A/A/1 incorporated into it on the assembly line, and with fewer problems, the Fw 190A-2 maintained the Fock Waff's superiority over British airpower.

On 12 February 1942, Fw 1908 participated in the epic air battle which developed above the famous 'Chumel Dash' of the German washings _Guiseau, Prizz: Eugen_, and _Scramhorst_ from the French port of Brest.

Attacking RAF aircraft and Fleet Air Arm Fairey Snordfish torpedo bombers were severely named by defensive Luftawfe 'top cover'. Most of the credit for the nearly fifty British aircraft destroyed went to the Fw 190. Simply put, the pilots of the RAF were able to score some victories over the Fw 190, but Kurt Tank's remarkable fighter had clearly become a thorn deeply imbedded in the RAF's side!

Production of the Fw 190A-2 began to taper off by mid-1942, being replaced on the assembly lines by the Fw 190A-3. Precise production figures of the A-2 are unknown, some sources quoting strangely similar totals for both the Fw 190A-1 and A-2 (possibly due to concurrent manufacturing). Figures of approximately 400 machines have been claimed, with others as high as 950. Some Fw 190A-2s were used as test beds for _Urmist-Bustafe_ (Factory Conversion) experimentation for future variants and accessory equipment.

7 This Fw 190A-2 has cooling slots, which ultimately became standard, but still features an early dual headrest support. Its outboard cannons have been removed and it is equipped with Fw 25 Identification Friend or Foe (IFF) radio (the aerial is visible below the art fuselage).

These aircraft are Per 190A-2s, as their 20mm indoor wing cameras indicate, yet none of them have cooling slots, indicating the use of a BBW BUC powerplant. Contrary to popular belief, the presence (or absence) of cooling slots is not a certain method of identifying the Per 190A-1, A2 or A3 variants.

Some early for 190s were sent to the Eastern Front for cold weather service evaluation and the harsh winter took its toll. This aircraft (an A-1 or A-2) has a later headrest support, but no cooling slots.

become disoriented following combat with RAF Spitifres over the English Channel and accidentally landed at RAF Penney, near Suansea. It was ironic that _Opt._ Faber even performed a victory roll over the airfield force personally delivering the Ps 190's secrets to Allied Intelligence' Wore yet for the _Lafighter_ British were about to release their thoroughbred from the Supermarket sables, the Spitifres Ma-IX, which would quickly dull the Fe 190's edge in air supremacy

Production figures of the Fu 190A-3 are, again, contradictory. Some sources claiming approximately 500 minutes being produced, while higher estimates claim over 200 were delivered in late 1941 and over 1800 were delivered in 1942. It must be noted that an extremely efficient system of receiving was being established by Focke-Wulf to re-did earlier variants, was very airfavings, as well as battle damaged aircraft to upload previous. Since the end of the war, this resulting effort has contributed to the confusion surrounding exact production totals, as well as the _Werke Number_ blocks assigned to completed aircraft.

Again named German publicly restrictions concerning new military equipment, approximately 60 (some sources state 75) Fw 190A-3s were sold to neutral Turkey in late 1942, along with replacement engines and weapons.

With the advent of the Fe 190A-3UV3 factory conversion, the A-3 could take on the role of _Jabab (Liqqdmdm)_. Black 34 is equipped with an ETC 501 fuseding rack, typified by a long vertical housing. A 300 fiber fuel tank could also be carried in place of a bomb load.

FUSELAGE ETC 501 RACK

An Fe 190A-3UV3 factory conversion to a high-altitude interceptor. The coupling air intakes allowed greater air flow to the supercharger and rear engine cylinder banks. This modification was found on subsequent Fe 190s on a limited basis.

## FW 190A-4

The five 190A-4 was essentially the same as the Fv 190A-3, however, the main FoG 7 radio was replaced with an FoG 16 radio, resulting in the addition of a vertical antenna mast at the tip of the tail fm, as well as a revision of the aerials with an extra lead in wire to the upper af afshose. The optional FoG 25 IFF radio was retained, but due to internal upgrades, the ventral with repair was relocated farther, although on some A-4 is could still be found in the forward position.

Similar to the Fv 190A-3, the A-4 was powered by a 1700 bp BMW 801D-1 or D-2 engines with the standard fuselage 'cooling slots'. On late series A-4 aircraft, hyperwier, adjustable cooling slits were to become more common, allowing the pilot to adjust the rate of airflow through the entire cooling. Some Fv 190A-4 was required with an NV 50 Methanol-Water engine boosting system for emergency power.

The plots 12mm zoomed heedtests was substantially widened, although a number of early A-4s were still fitted with the slender headtest of the A-3. Conversely, some late model A-3 were equipped with the wider A-4 headtest, possibly as a retrofitting on some very late model A-4s the perforated poor of main should have replaced with a solid design.

With the introduction of the Fv 190A-4 in early 1942, the Fock-Wall was being transformed into a multi-Follow aircraft, thanks to the continuing research with history conversions (_Univariant-Bausality_ and the establishment of filtered conversion sets (_Univariant-Bausality_). Of the many corrections being made available, the most noteworthy were as follows:

**Fv 190A-4041** A high speed fighter-bombrum conversion with defensive armant reduced to the wing root cameras and the addition of an ETC ventral fuselage bomb neck. Nightography was enhanced with the addition of a point lying edge landing light and optical exhaust flame dampers. This would account for the desalination of some Fv 190A-4's _Neckchladow_ (tight fighter-bombers). A number of these night fighter-bombers are known to have operated with _SISO_ 10 (_SchuelRangfeschendorf_Fast Bomber Wing) for nocturnal harassment radio against England.

**Fw 190A-403** A ground assault variant with the outboard MG FF cameras deleted, inboxed, underdraging door removed, and a ventral fuselage ETC 501 rack fitted for the carrying of variable bomb loads. This included 250 kg (551 Ib) and 500 kg (1100 Ib) bombs, as well as the _Enhangerova_ 4 (ER 4) multiple bomb pallet, which could carry four SC 50 (110 Ib) bombs. Aircraft converted for this ground attack role saw combat with a number of units, and were the basis for the future Fw 190F-1.

**Fw 190A-4/04** A photo-recomnaissance version, like the Fv 190A-3/UA, with the outboard MG FF cameras removed and equipped with up to two internal, downward facing cameras, with an ventral fuselage ports. The camera control box was mounted to a central cockylylon beneath the instrument panel and between the y\(\hat{\rm{t}}\)'s legs. Among the units known to have used this version previously was 2.5/1923, a long range reconnaissance Staff operating for a time on the Western Front.

**Fw 190A-4/04** A high speed fighter-bombrum without MOF F cameras and, optionally, the fudge of M1 _running_ pass were removed. A fuselage ETC 501 rack installed for the bomb load, while a 300 filter lead tank was suspended beneath each of the fudge of four Junkers designed mountingers. These initial conversations (based on W 8.866/69 and 670) formed the basis of the future Fw 1900 _Agglomero-Rechelive_ (_Cube-Roi_ - Long-range fighter-bombers) series. Fw 190A-4/18 were issued in limited numbers to several units, including _SISO_ and some specialized units with _Ambigrosededers_ (Bomber Wing). Count radius was listed as 1600 km (994 miles).

**Ratadversaries as Lafwaaffe pilots became more proficient with the _Wargger_. Along with continual daylight fighter skirmishes, Fu 199 _Jabos_, based in France, fleew cross-channel bombing, radias against British airfields and cities by day and by night. While some Fock-wind units provide support for German forces in the case-aw batteries of North Africa and the Mediterranean, the Event _Food/graphene_ compiled impressive activities over all manner of Soviet ground forces and aircraft. Two of the most notable Eastern Front units were for 51 _Motives_ and 53 _Grinner_. (Green Hearts), employing standard Fu 196 fibers, along with their bomb idea _Labs_ for any variety of missions.

Production of the Fu 190A-4 continued until early 1943, after some 900 aircraft were reportedly proposed, possibly due in part to the remainder of earlier airframes.

### Headrest Development

Having holisted the Fu 190A-4 into the firing position this Russian front ground crew prepares for weapons calibration. This heavily re-emundunged aircraft features while until markings, a yellow band behind the traveling cross, and two low visibility numbers for identification (a small 5 on the cowling and a 2 on the wing leading edge). Also visible is the larger armored headrest and the wing root armment panel in the raised position.

## FW 190a-5

Even as the Fe iv 190a-4 was leaving the assembly lines, preparations were being made, in late 1942, for the introduction of the Fe iv 190a-5. This variant, with a number of detailed refinements, was to be even more adaptable to conversion sets for a number of differing combat models.

Physically, the Fe iv 190a-5 was similar to the A-4, but to improve the center-of-gravity and reduce vibration, the engine and working were extended forward by 152.5mm (programmatly to inches). This required lengthening the stokes together named named and forward fuselge, as well as the addition of a curved filter installed immediately in front of the wing roots.

Further details were added, including structural modification of the radex, in upward geom positioning of the open fuselge radio access hatch, and standardization of the adjustable fuselge engine cooling skills. Due to internal equipment providers, including storage of the pilots's spherical oxygen containers, the grid meets fit all rotational quantum was relocated further after. The solid unnamed hotls, which had been seen on late production Fe iv 190a-4's, would be gradually standardized on the 4.5-Fe iv high altitude operations at intakes for supercharginer at flow (like fixed to the Fe iv 190a-3/7) were installed on the cowling side bulges on some A-5s.

Defensive arrangement remained the same as the Fe iv 190a-4 (two MG 17s, two MG 151 cm), and two MG FF cameras), however, the outdoor MG FF cameras were often removed depending upon operational needs. The ventral fuselge ETC 501 rack could be installed to carry a bomb bot 4 or a 300 filter today, this being randomly substituted by the addition of a simplified fuel tank rack which had been developed for dedicated fighter variants. Provisions were also made for the installation of two ETC 50 bomb racls beneath each outer wing for cartridge 90% by 136 (110) bombs, although this straight option was fairly limited in the Cuikle the streamlined TG 50Cs also near topant-foot attack variants of the Fe iv 190, these two were other unfriend, such as those on Luftaw drive bombs like the hunkers Juftaw SR/RR. Again. With the outer wing MG FF cameras removed, a gun camera (EK 16 or BSK 16) could be installed in the outward leading edge of the port wing.

Extensive test were conducted with the Fe iv 190a-5 employing the MW 30 Methanol-Water engine boost system, as well as the GM 1700 lit phaw SR/DD-2 engine for short periods of advantageous speed. Unfortunately, technical problems hampered development of the GI system, foresling its service introduction.

Numvers conversion sets were tested on the Fe iv 190a-5, some of which were operational: the employed. Most were _Uncruit-Rainzer_ (factory conversion sets) with at least two _Russian_ (field conversions) being provided, as follows.

**Fu 190a-5/01/1** current TEST led for two "Rainzer-Bonitz" 39mm MK 103 cameras in underlying trags. Provisions with this system led to development.

**Fu 190a-5/02** A _Nacht Jab-Rei_ (night long-range fighter-bounce) with elliptical exhaust flame shields on the forward fuselge, a landing light and gun camera installation mounted in the outer wing, and provision for one 300 filter net launch each wing. An ETC 501 fuselge rack was fitted for bomb carrying. The MG FF cameras were deleted.

**Fu 190a-5/03** A ground-attack variation eliminating the outburst using camons and providing a fuselge ETC 501 centering rack for bomb loads. Corsing air intakes with tropical filters were provided as an option. These conversions were operationally deployed, serving as the foremont of the Fe iv 190a-2 series.

**Fu 190a-5/04** A proposed photo-recomnaissance variant similar to the A-3/4 and A-4/04.

In a typical case, the 190A-S would continue to see production and service even after the defeat of the Third Reich. Among the many'shadow factories' which had been organized by Kunt Tank under the Fock-Wulf unredits (including Pons, Coutrus, and Sorau), an underground facility had been established as SNC on Centre (S.N.C.A.C.) at C/C. France. In an effort to rebuild France's Armee de I'Air following the war, 64 Fru 190As were assembled by SNC under the designation NC 900. Ironically, the principal unit which was briefly equipped with the NC 900 was CE 1115 Normant Avenue, the famous French volunteer until which had battled Germany's Luffwaffe as part of the Soviet Air Force on the Eastern Front. Production of the NC 900 was terminated in early 1946 and the service life of the NC 900 lasted only for as long as the Armee de I'Air needed to recognize with up-to-date aircraft.

The **Fw 190A-S (and some A-8a)** were produced in post-war France by SNCA, a previous-ly established Fock-Wulf shadow factory located at C/C. France. Production ended in 1946 after 64 machines had been manufactured. Service use was limited. (Paul Camilo)

## 6 Fw 190a-7

As originally conceived, the Fw 190A-7 was to be produced as a dedicated high speed photon reconnaissance version, however, the shifting war situation dictated a greater need for the unabated production of fighter and ground-assult versions. In the event, aiframes which had already been started in the improved Fw 190A-7s fighter, were designated as Fw 190A-7s, the A-8 designation being reserved for an more technically upgraded machine. As such, only 8D PW 190A-7s were produced, starting in December of 1943, before the fully developed A-8 super-sodel it.

Physically, the Fw 190A-7 was essentially similar to the Fw 190A-6, but the 7.92mm fuse-lag 3617 machine guns were now replaced with the larger caliber 13mm M631 machine guns, offering superior rate of fire and a loading of up to 2000 rounds per run. To accommodate the larger guns, the early flat-speed fuselge arrangement panel was replaced with a double budget panel. In detail, the pilot's Rvei (CIDD) snapshot was replaced with the improved Fw 160B. Engine coupling laches were revised, while radio equipment options of the Fw 162 and Fw 251F were retrained. The wing arrangement of four Mawaw M631/2012 commands remained unchanged, although some machines against hand the outer wing approaches led to win operational needs. As before, a vental fuselge ETC 801 rack could be added (or the simplified 300 filter link) cards for carrying out for bomb loads. Also, most of the Fw 190A-7s were produced without underwater damage costs, which now became the accepted practice.

Several _Rissake_ were planned for the Fw 190A-7, although little use would be made of them.

_Rissake_ **1 (R1)** Two underlying WB 151 weapons containers, each with two MG 151 can.

Essentially similar to the A-4, the Fw 190A-7 was the first variant to feature heterogeneous 12mm M631 machine guns, resulting in a double-budged arrangement panel. While 5.5 mw 190A-7s, has lost a outer wing cannoms removed; it appears to have flash suppressors fitted to the coupling pins. The Fw 162F DF loop serial under the **at** tissue-lag was common from ate Fw 190A-6s onward.

mons, with 145 rounds per spin. The outer wing cations were deleted.

_RMSR_**size 2 (B/2)** The outer wing MG 151 canoms replaced with short-barreled 30mm MK 100 cmous with 55 rounds per spin.

_RMSR_**size 3 (B/3)** One 30mm MK 103 canom under each wing with 35 rounds per spin.

_RMSR_**size 6 (B/6)** One 2.11 blue launched anti-inbound rocket beneath each wing. _R_**size 2 and 5 saw the greatest chance of operational use on the FeV 90A-7.

_Doppler reflect Tank_ Although many sources have attached that are at 190A-7 was used for the testing of extended _Lang Doppler_ (double field) 20 for inverting total tanks, more recent sources have claimed the test bed to have actually been an FeV 190A-7 (WNF. 380394), This was one of several'slipper' tank arrangements, designed by FGZ of Sturggart, which failed so one operational service.

Fu 190A-7's began joining combat units in early 1944, most being sent to the Western Front for Germany's defense against a seemingly endless border of Allied bowners. In this capacity, some 'A-7's managed to survive until war's send, despite the horrific attrition which was soon to be suffered by the Luftawaffe.

**Although only 90 FeV 190A-7's were produced, this damaged example survived until the raw's end, being captured at Pilsen, Bohemia in 1945. From this viewpoint, an outstanding feature separating the A-7 from the earlier A-4 can be seen, the budget MG 131 cover. Additionally, FeV 190A-7's retained the earlier mid-mounted pilot tube.**

## 114 Fw 190A-8

As the war entered its final stages, the Fw 190A-8 became the most important of the A series variants, constituting most of the remaining numbers of Fw 190 production right to the end of hostillites. Externally, the A-8 was essentially similar to the five 190A-7, but with a host of refinements.

In termsally, the compartment behind the pilot's cockpit now contained an additional 115 filter (30.3 gallon) fuel cell, which could be substituted with supply tanks for an MW 50 methanol-water or GM-1 nitrous-oxide engine boosting system. The tri-spherical oxygen containers were repositioned, as were the fuel lines and radio equipment. Externally, this resulted in the addition of a ventral circular access panel, an additional grid slot pulse fesselage ratio given just under the fat canopy shelf, at a fused spinner access just below the port side cockpit area, and an additional rectangular access panel just below the standford fuselage canopy shelf.

Externally, the ventral fuselage ETC 501 rack was moved forward 20cm (eight inches) to reduce the center of gravity. Deletion of the induced undercarage doors was standardized. The standford suing quite tube was moved from the mid-point of the wing leading edge to the wing. Standard radio equipment consisted of FuG 162K and FuG 258 HF, detectable by a ventral port wing root morane mast and atvert fuselage D/F loop (FuG 162Y) and the attl ventral strip aerial (F60 25A).

Armanent remained unchanged with two fuselage mounted MG 131 machine guns (400 rounds per gap), wing root MG 151/20C zones (250 rounds per gap) and two outward MG 151/20C annoms (125 rounds per gap); Shipfly raised rectangular plates were added to the wing’s upper surfaces in conjunction with the outward MG 151 cannoms. When carried, a gun camera (KE 16 or RSE 16) was mounted on an onboard position of the port wing leading edge. For additional equipment the FV 190A-8 real timed amit entry in _Rustafizem_:

_Rustafizem_ **1 (R1)** A WB 151 weapons container under each wing, each containing two 20mm 163 (15/20 cmoms with 125 rounds per gap).

_Rustafizem_ **2 (R2)** Two 30mm MK 108 cannoms with 55 rounds per spin, replacing the outward wing MG 151 cannoms.

_Rustafizem_ **3 (R3)** A-00-moded 30mm MK 103 cannon beneath each wing for anti-bonnter control-take a na improved dosme of the coverings featured a hinged center section for common breed access and tapered coverings over the long camon barrels. This _Rustafizem_ saw limited operational use, if any, due to its detrimental weight and drag.

_Rustafizem_ **4 (S (R4)** and **R5)** According to some, these risk respectively indicated the installation of an engine boosting system (such as the GM-1) or the additional 115 liter (30.3 gallon) fuel cell in the art fuselage. While ourse success claim the R4 designation referred to an equipment for the outflow MG 151 20mm cannons.

_Rustafizem_ **6 (R8)** One tube-launched _WG_r2 21 (21cm) anti-bonnber rocket mounted beneath each wing. So effective had these weapons proven to be, that the RLM specified that fifty per of NF 190A-8s produced the capable of mounting the R6 conversion off the assembly lines.

_Rustafizem_ **7 (R7)**_Shumpiger_ (assault fighter) with additional internal and external armor plating for anti-bonnter operations. This consisted of internal armor for the fuselage MG 131 dye (4mm lower and 15mm rear), external side fuselage plates (5mm), side canopy and windshielded arrangement standard glass (30mm) and forward windshield (50mm).

_Rustafizem_ **8 (R8)** A combination of R2 (outboard 30mm MK 108 cannons) and R7 _Stumpiger_ armor plating. This additionally allowed for the protection of the outward MK 108 cannons and amounting bins with 4mm internal wing armorted plates. This _Rustafizem_ was particularly popular with dedicated _Ramsigger_ anti-bonnter defense _Suffelin_ and _Grospen_ operating on the Western Front.

_Rustafizem_ **11 (R11)** An all weather fighter conversion, equipped with a BMW 801TU or TS powerplant, Frd 162E and Frd 125 radio gear, a PKS 12 auto-pilot system, and a heated windshield.

_Rustafizem_ **12 (R12)** A combination of R2 (MK 108 outburst cannons) and R11 (all-wealth-er fighter equipment), but with a standard BMW 8012-2 engine.

Beyond the use of conversion sets, other versions of the Fw 190A-8 were created for specialized missions. The Fw 190A-8 _Nordic Auto-Rei_ (Night Long-range Higher-bombner) featured fused exhaust dampers, undergoing 300 liter Ital tanks on Messesthemit designed using racks, and the removal of the outboard wing cannons. The Fw 190A-8 could serve as a _/lab_ by carrying a bomb load on its ventral ETC 501 rack and having its outboard wing cannons deleted. With the removal of the outer cannons the undercwing armment panel could bereplaced with a smooth access plate, eliminating the flaired spent casing chues, and in this form the Fe 190A-8 Jaboc became indistinguishable from the Fe 190F-8 ground-assault variant.

As the borders of the Third Reich continued too shrink, the Fe 190F-8 ground-assault variant.

A brief overview of the Fe 190A-8 shows, along with intercept and _Jaboc_ missions, the head on, near suicidal attacks of the _Ransuplayer_ plips beside the desperate course of the Lafluffau during the Reich's 3-digo months. Earlier variant of the Fe 190 were fitted with _Supplementary_ error to increase the interwavithing (such as the remaining A6-A8 and A-7), while still other Fe 190 had their parameter stripped to just the wrong 200m cameras for greater speed. Unusual variations of weapons were experimented with, such as a single rear firing event fusselose WG/2, 1 rocket tube, which allowed a projectile to be discharged into a boxner formation following a _Ransuplayer_ (Montering man) attack. In short, anything which would bring down a Millobel power banky created each to Germany's existence. The aerial control of the Eastern Front and in the Mediterranean was equally tenacious.

## FW 190A-10

The Fw 190A-10 was to be a ground-attack version of the A-9 with wing mounted MK 103 30mm cmons, enlarged main wheels and a BMW 801TS/TH powerplant. Several weapons packages were planned for the A-10, which was to be produced by recycling older Fw 190 air-frames, rather than establishing a dedicated assembly line. As the war situation worsened, the Fw 190A-10 was cancelled.

### Bomb Rack

The _RLM_ dictated that 50 percent of the Fw 190A-8s production should be capable of carrying _Rulesstance_ 6. Amorres of 3G 28 side a 21 cm (210mm) W/Z: 21 rocket into the launch tube. The main support hook and electrical triggering connections are visible.

After the rocket was loaded, the support rods were tightened. The tubes were angled upward, allowing the pilot to gauge optimum attacking position and trajectory. The pilot tube which was installed on the starboard wing was moved to an outboard position on the Fw 190A-8.

## 111 Fw 1900a-6

By late 1943 single engined figures were being accepted into specialized units of the _Nachtigaberbehande_, especially those using _Wide San_ (Wild Boar) tactics to help defend against the flocs of RAF bombers. In effect, these figures were sent up to attack British bombers using whatever visual contact could be made by the glare of searchlights, flares, or burning targets. The two principal single engine figures that would participate in this struggle: the Messencharift 1970 and the Focke-Wulf Fe 190.

As on-board search radars became available in quantity, _Nachtigger_ conversions were made to Fw 1903-6 and A-8 variants, using FiG 216 (_Nepton_ Y) and FwG 217 (_Nepton_ J-2 and J-3) devices. On both the A-6 and A-5 versions, exhaust shields could be added below the reassignment panel: flash suppresses were optional on the fasches machine guns, and landing lights could be installed in the leading edge of the outer wing. The fasches ETC 801 rack was often defined for carrying a 300 lfor flux, extending the Fe 1903's combat duration. The _Statistica_ 11 (R11) coversen set could also be utilized, providing the Fe 190 _Nachtigger_ with all-weather capability.

Externally, two principal radar antenna arrays were utilized, consisting of whip aerials (Yagi type antennas) along the fuselage spine and outer wing panels (up to twenty plus elements), or a system of two support musts on the leading edge of each wing with each rsm carrying two depletion constants. Most sources confirm that the Fe 1903-6 _Nachtigger_ was normally fitted with the whip aerial arrangement, whereas the Fe 1904-8 was seen with either installation. The joint's radar indicator was usually installed in the upper left hand area of the cockpit instrument panel.

Fw 1908 participating in _Wide San_ missions were not always radar equiped variants. Some utilis employed straight figures or _nachtig_ (left figure-bornners) if needed. Single engined _Wide San_ aircraft were employed less and less into 1944 as twin engined radar equipped aircraft again assumed control of night defense duties. Still, some units were reorganized specifically for the purpose of combating marauoting British Mosquito nightlighters, extending the use of the single engined _Nachtigger_. Figure 111 and _Nachtigger_. Figure 112 and _Nachtigger_ (right figure) from _Oberieutant_ **Krause** of 1/_NAG_/10 in 1944. It was equipped with Fw 217 _Nachtigger_, and glare shields and flash suppressors on its fuselage guns. Variations of the stylized _Wide San_ (Wild Boar) emblen were carried by Fw 1908 serving in the night-interceptor role.

## FW 190F-2

The Fw 190F-2 was based on the Fw 190A-5/U17 factory conversion, being externally identical to the A-5 model with its six-link extension of the forward fascible. Similar to the F-1 the defensive armment was reduced to the fuseling mounted MO 17 machine guns and the wing root MO 151 cannons. Both load capacity was the same, utilizing the fuseling ETC 501 rack. Many Fw 190F-2s were produced with side-coupling air intakes with tropical filters. Production ceased after 270 F-2s had been delivered, most of them to the Eastern Front, although a number were used in the Mediterranean theater.

## FW 190F-3

Production of the Fw 190F-3 was based on the Fw 190A-5/U17 factory conversion, which allowed for greater bomb load capacity. With the majority of F-3s being F-3/R1s, four additional ETC 50 bomb tracks were fitted (bunch the outburst along), with streamlined frangs, for carrying out 50 B (110 Ib) bombs. On many Fw 190F-3s, typical cowling intakes were added and an optional gun came could be installed in the wing leading edge. Plans were made for the availability of the _Ristastex_ 3 conversion set of two 30nm MK 100 underlying cannons for anti-tank operations, but this saw little, if any, use.

Just over 270 Fw 190F-3 were produced at the Arab facility before the series was terminated -- most examples were sent to the Eastern Front. Production of the Fw 190F series was suspended by the introduction of the Fw 190F. The Fw 190F-4, F-5 and F-6 were ultimately cancelled However, production of the Fw 190F series was re-established with the introduction of the Fw 190F-8 in 1944.

Vos Bv 246 glide bomb. The body of the weapon was attached to the fuselage ETC 501 ventral rack with its wings spanning beneath the wings of the Fu 190. Stabilizing rods pushed the wings of the Bv 246 downward at the tips to spring it away from the underscript of the Fu 190 upon release.

Until the end of the war, Fu 1907-88-8 were being encountered by advancing Allied forces on all fronts. Few 1908's served alongside the Fu 190A _Jabos_ of various _Schutcherkovkovkov_, most notably \(SG\), 1, 2, and 4, \(SG\) 2 (previously _Subageschroduct 2_) was the home unit of Germany's highly decorated hero, _Oberst_ Hans Ulrich Rudel, who split this combat sortises between his beloved Ju 87G tank housing _Stohad_ and his Fe 190

Although Germany's silites were not supplied with the Fu 190 on a large-scale basis, some 70 Fu 1907-8s were dispatched to Hungarian Air Force units for use is fighter bombers in late 1944 and early 1945. Prior to the anti-Axis coup in August of 1944, a limited number of Fu 1908 were also used by Rumanian air units.

## Fw 190g-1

The Fw 190G variant was conceived as a dedicated high speed, long-range fighter-bomber (_Logalhouber-Reichelve et al._). The first of these, the Fw 190G-1, was based directly on the Fw 1900A-4/US conversion, with 300 liter underchewing fuel tanks suspended on junkers they raised mountings, and a fuselge ETC 501 rack for a bomb load. To reduce weight for extra speed and range, defensive armament was reduced to only the 20mm wing root MG 151 commons. In fact, the elimination of the fuselge and outer wing guns was a trait of all subsequent Fw 190G variants.

Only 49 Fw 190G-1, based on the A-4 airframe, are believed to have been produced before manufacturing centers converted to the extended fuselages (Fw 1900A-5 and subsequent airframes). By 1943, surviving examples of the original Fw 1900A-4/US conversions were reportedly redesignated as Fw 190G-1s.

### Fw 190g-1 (Fw 190a-4/u8)

### Fw 190g-2

The Fw 1906-2 was based on the extended nose Fw 1904-5/u2, US, and U1S factory conversions, all of which had been designed as _Aido-Rei_ variants. Amramment was reduced to just the wing root 20mm camons and a fuselge ETC 501 rack for bomb loads. Underwing 300 filter fuel tanks were usually suspended on the more simplified unfaired Messerschmitt _Tragers_ (Assessment carriers), which were readily identifiable by their N shaped tracing struts, although mobile complex in their appearance, the Messerschmitt rack produced less drag than the Junkers style faired months, affording greater speed.

A further limited production version was the Fw 1906-2/N (_Nuclidro-Rei_ - night long range fighter-bomber), which was equipped with "fluted" flame damper extensions on the exhaust pipes. An additional detail of Fw 1900A-28 operating in either the day or night role, was the optional installation of a gun camera in the outer port using.

Sources differ on the number of Fw 1906-2s produced; some indicate as few as 468, while after estimates chair over 600 machines had rolled off assembly lines. Fw 1906-2s were pressed into service on all front with _Schachtgeschrader_ and specialized bombing _Suffelte_ within _Jaggedeschorders_. Some were issued to _Kampfeschunders_ (bomber units) while still others were assigned to _NachtschlachtGruppen_ (night ground-attack groups).

## 6.2 Fw 1906-3

The Fw 1906-3 was again based on Fw 1906-3 or A-6 airframes, entering production during the summer of 1943. Amament and load carrying capacity was the same as that of the Fw 1906-2, however, the G-3 was characterized by the installation of two Focke-Wolf designed carrier wings, referred to as Focke-Wolf _Triggers_ (Focke-Wolf carrier). These carriers were distinctive in being elongated pylons with adjustable side braces. The Focke-Wolf _Triggers_ were capable of carrying either two 300 filter test banks (one under each way or two analyzing bombs, the usual load being a 250 kg (551) US weapon, although each rack was capable of sustaining a larger load. This allowed the Fw 1906-3 the flexibility of being equipped with a faciese bomb with undergoing tanks for long range missions, a faciese 300 filter test bank with two underwater bombs for medium range missions, or a triple bomb load for short range missions.

Some Fw 1906-3s were equipped with the PKS 11 or 12 auto-plot system, while a further small number were tested with GM-1 introns-oxide engine positions. Optionally, some 6-3s were emitted with tropicalized cognitive tanks, while a limited number were equipped with high-technique _Thied_ exhaust dampers and port using landing lights under the design for 1906-3s (see _NatCraft_-_300-Ref._).

Late in the wire, some Fw 1906-3s were retro-fitted with four underheing ETC 50 bomb tracks (two under each swing) under the designation Fw 1906-3/R1. The _Rississize_ 1 field conversion had been made available for the two 1906-3s, allowing for the carrying of four 50 kg (110) under nondworking bombs, and is the air situation worsened for Germany, surviving Fw 1906-3s were modified according to tactical needs.

Fw 1906-3s were designed to all war fronts, particularly Russian Front _Scholarteresolartes_ and Mediterranean mins such as _Scholarteresolartes_, where some examples fell intact into Allied hands.

Precise production figures for Fw 1906s (and later F variants) remain vague, likely due to concurrent manufacturing with Fw 1904 fighters and the constant recycling of earlier models, proposals for Fw 1906-4 through G-7 variants did not produce combat replacements for the Fw 1906-3, being limited to paper projects and few actual prototypes.
The Fw 1900-3 was essentially the same as the G-2, but equipped with the improved Fock-Witt Triggers beneath the wings. These racks could carry either 300 liter tanks or bombs (usually 2500g551b bombs).

The empty fuselage gun bay demonstrates a feature of all Fw 1900s, the removal of the fuselage mounted machine guns. The indoor positioned pilot tube also was common to the G-1 through G-3 variants. Fw 1900s saw combat on all fronts.

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:54]

## FW 190G-8

The Fw 190G-8 was a contemporary of the Fw 190A-8 and F-8 series, also entering production in 1944. Externally, the G-8 looked like the F-8, but the fresglue machine guns were removed, although the buged fuselage arrangement panel was usually retained. Ammment, as with all Fw 190G was restricted to the wing root MG 151 200m cannons. Like the A-8 and F-8 models, the Fw 190G-8 was further identifiable by its outburst positioned prior tube. Also with the usual fresglue ETC 501 ventral track, the Fw 190G-8 was equipped with two undrowing EtTC 503 reads, which were streamlined and, like the Fw 190G-3, allowed the Fw 190G-8 to carry either 300 filter underscript fonts or bombs. Many later examples were fitted with blown hoods, while others were equipped with "fluted" exhaust demers for normal missions.

As the borders of the Reich shrink closer to Germany, long-range missions become of less importance, resulting in the installation of four underhang EtTC 71 bomb racks (to carry four 50kg bombs) under the designation of 190G-87B. This feature was reportedly applied to surviving by 190G-3 if needed. When fully loaded, the Fw 190G-8 achieved a weight of 5,200 kg (11,1463.9 lts) with a combined range of approximately 1,125 km (690 miles). These figures are reportedly based on a rising condition of a fuselage 300 filter tank and maximum undrowing them load, for at a trophe bomb load. In a tully loaded condition, the G-8's speed was reduced to approximately 450 km (279 mph).

Of the Fw 190G-8 manufactured (precision numbers are unknown), most were assigned to ground attack units along the collapsing Eastern and Western Fronts, serving alongside other close support variants of the Fw 190G-10. Although a further G variant was planned, the Fw 190G-10, it failed to process beyond design stages due to the war situation.

## FW 190 Trainers

The prospect of creating a two-set PV 190 for jiki conversion training (which had been proposed earlier in the war) had taken on an added importance by 1943 when bonner pilots, especially those assigned to the Sada units, required quick and easy retraining to the Fw 190 ground attack variants. Some of the first conversions involved the use of FV 190A-5s, such were stopped of armament and fitted with an attension of the canopy to house an instrucc-s color, it is believed that this variant was assigned the provisional designation of a S-VIU, which conflicts with an armcent test bed given the same title. However, it was not unusual for a designation to be re-assigned after the project was terminated.

Following the introduction of the FV 190A-8/11 underlay, a two-set version was assigned the restoration of the restoration of FV 190A-8/11, the extended range being similar to that of the two scan A's version. In the event, both variants came to be known as the FV 1905-5 and FV 1905-8/6.8 _S.R.S.(S)/TagTagTagTag. The S-SO could be distinguished from the S-5 by the retention of its helped fuselage ramament panel, although it also was unarmed. Some S-8s also featured a lateral extension of the att window, using straight filter stampstiness, to improve the instrocrocers' forward vision. Ultimately, only a handful of both variants were manufactured, beginning in June 1944, and were issued to training units and a few operational combat units as required.

Surviving Fu 1905 aircraft found by the Allies at war's end carried a variety of camofage schemes, often with simplified national markings. One damaged FV 1905-5' wearing full Easten front remains was credited to _Sokollechespecheury_ 151. Small letters behind the canopy displayed the machine's _Verke Number_ (W.N. 2541) and a manufacturing date of 29 June 1944. Although FV 1905 times were based primarily on A-5 and A-8 afframes, the sole remaining example, currently on display in England, features a manufacturer's data plate describing it as an Fw 190F-8/11.
