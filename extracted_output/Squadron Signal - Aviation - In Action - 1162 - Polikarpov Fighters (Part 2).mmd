## Two Seat Trainers

### UTI-2 Trainer

In July of 1935, the I-16 Type 4 fighter was assigned to front-line Fisher Aviation Reggments. Simultaneously, it was decided to develop a two seat trainer version of the I-16 to assist pilots in conversion from earlier bignhers to the new monophac. The flight characteristics of the I-16 were demanding and it soon became obvious that novice pilots needed at least a couple of familiarization flights in a training version. When young pilots transitioned from the Polikyour U-2 bignhers directly to the hot monophac I-16 the attrition. rate, especially during take offs and langlys was quite high.

During 1936, the first series of UTI-2 (UTI-_Chechoa Tenirovachy Istebileit_Fighter Trainer) trainers were produced. The UTI-2 was based on the I-16 Type 4 with a second rear cockpit for the instructor and dual controls. The aircraft was unmanned and was powered by an 480 hP M-22 power plant, UTI-2s were produced in very limited numbers, mainly due to the fact that the more powerful M-25 engine had become available.

The introduction of the I-16 had revealed that the Polikyour U-2 was no longer suited for basic training, since many novice pilots had great difficulty in mastering the I-16 after receiving their initial training in the Polikyour bignhers. As a result, a two seat now wing training monophone, the Yakubov UT-2, was chosen as the primary trainer and the UT-1 single seat aerobatic trainer, which had flight characteristics close to the I-16, for advanced training. Then fighter pilots would receive their conversion training in the UTI-2 and later UTI-4, before finally progressing to the single seat I-16 fighter.

### UTI-4 Trainer

During 1937, the first UTI-4 two seat trainers were delivered to the Figure Aviation Regments. Once UTI-4 production was launched, an order was issued by the Ministry of Aviation Production, that every fourth airframe on the I-16 production line should be complete.

ed as a trainer. The UTI-4 differed from the earlier UTI-2, in that it was based on the I-16 Type 5 airframe with a M-25 power plant.

The UTI-4, like the earlier UTI-2, carried no armament in order to save weight due to the introduction of the second cockpit. Normally, the instructor would occupy the rear cockpit, while the student usually occupied the front cockpit. The standard cockpit was moved to the rear some seventech inches (45 cm) and the fuel tank was reconoured and reduced in size to enable the second cockpit to be installed in the fuselage.

The cockpit entry door was deleted on the UTI-4. While the fighter had a straight cockpit, a new, farther single piece windscreen was installed in front of the front cockpit and a second, smaller tunnel shaped 'windshields" was installed between the front and the rear cockpit.

Early UTI-4s were all fitted with the M-25 power plant, but when the M-25 became available, it was also installed in the UTI-4, a number of early UTI-4s also lacked a propeller spinner, however, this was not an identification feature, since a number of early UTI-4s did carry a spinner.

Early UTI-4s had a 'tunnel' shaped rear windscreen but, in order to improve the view out the front from the rear cockpit, the padded head rest in the front cockpit was lowered and a flatter,-sloped frameless windshield was fitted on later production versions.

The two seat fighter-tainer was progressively developed along side the fighter series. The only exception was that the UT1-4 retained the large wing flaps, which were standard to the early fighter versions I-16 Type 5 and I-16 Type 6, throughout its production life. As production proceeded, most of the improvements introduced on the fighters were also automatically introduced on the trainer, such as improved instrumentation and cable center for the main undercramage.

When the I-16 Type 10 became available with its M-2SV power plant, this same engine was also fitted to the UT1-4. The first UT1-4 with the new engine left the production line at GAZ-21 and GAZ-153 during 1938. These M-2SV powered trainers had also M-3 charged at intake on the lower engine end 19. While the early UT1-4 had a single exhaust stack in the lower orbit. of the exhaust port, M-2SV powered UT1-4 had two exhaust stacks in the lower port. Most of the standard production UT1-4s powered by the M-2SV engine were equipped with an I-16 Type 5 propeller.

A number of UT1-4s were fitted with a fixed undercramage, and as a result, no landing gear start and wheel covers were installed.

Late production UT1-4s had the tailshield replaced a tailwheel. Due to shortage of trainer versions of modern fighters, such as the X-1 and the LAG3, the UT1-4s moved as a transition trainer for young objects listed by fighters fibers. In the early stage of the Great Particle War, the UT1-4s show several to the reconnaissance role over the front. A number of UT1-4s were also assigned to Fighter Aviation Regimes at the front for liancing duties. Even in 1944, when all I-16 had been withdrawn from active duty, the UT1-4s suffered on.

A number of UT1-4s were also converted with fixed skinding gear. As a result the main belt covers were detected and cables were attached to front of the east of the sky to keep from moving in flight. A small six was also attached to the tailshield.

The UT1-4 also saw service as a blind flying time. Initially a fabric, folding test was installed in the nextorbit which was closed just before take off. Other UT1-4s converted for this duty were fitted with a rear sliding buoyed boost. Some UT1-4s were also equipped with a rudder trim and some lane production UT1-4s were fitted with a tailwheel replacing the tailsh4. UT1-4s serving in the blind flying training role were still in use during 1943.

Between 1937 and mid-1939, a total of 1.639 UT1-2 and UT1-4 trimers were built at GAZ-**This UT1-4 was used as a blind flying time during 1938. The rear canopy is covered by a rear sliding tripwood hood. The rudder trim tab is a non-standard fitting. (G. F. Petrov)**the propeller arc. During the initial stages of the flight test program, no armament was carried and dummy bursts were installed in the wings.

In line November of 1933, a full scale mock-up was built. The projected performance figures for the TXRB-12 were so promising, that, even before the first prototype had been completed, the question of placing the fighter into production was raised.

The M-22 powered TXRB-12 was rolled out of the factory on 28 December 1933 and flew for the first time on 30 December, with Vahar F. Chislavot in the controls. A day later the factory test program was started.

The TXRB-12 prototype was equipped with a fixed ski landing gear, although this was a temporary feature needed because of the harsh winter weather. In its original configuration, the TXRB-12 was equipped with a small radiator, but only factory tests soon revealed that the stability was less than satisfactory and the radar was enlarged. Additionally, the three blade Hamilton-Standard propeller was replaced by a two blade Soviet V-22 propeller, while the Wright-Cyclome powered TXRB-12bis retained the three blade Hamilton-Standard propeller.

During early 1934, while all undergoing factors, the engine coupling of the TXRB-12 was modified to overcome problems with engine overheating. The new working was more tapered and the front face was enlarged with the cylinder fiungs being deleted. Additionally, two air flashes were installed on top of the engine coating.

The TXRB-12bis prototype, powered by a Wright-Cyclome SGR-1820-F-2 power plant (because the intended GSR-1820-F-3 was unavailable) made its first flight during January of 1934. The TXRB-12bis prototype differed from the TXRB-12 primarily in having a larger moving. Factory tests for both aircraft were conducted by Vahar F. Chislavot.

Despite the various shortcomings detected in the TXRB-12 and TXRB-12bis prototypes, which were not fully corrected, prototypes were transferred to the Scientific Test Institute of the Red Air Force (NII-SVS) for State Acceptance Trials. The acceptance program, which lasted from 1 to 12 February 1934, was conducted by test pilots V.K. Kokhaki for the TXRB-12 and V.A. Segenbrock for the TXRB-12bis.

Due to the winter weather, the test program had to be performed with fixed ski landing gear on both aircraft but, even with the extra drag, the performance of the new fighter was impressive. The TXRB-12 reached 190 mph (306 km/h) at sea level, while the TXRB-12bis reached a speed of 218 mph (351 km/h). Both tests praised the simple controls of the aircraft and its maneuvering, the TXRB-12 and ended only 15.5 seconds to complete a 360 degree turn. On the other hand, the aircraft was very unstable at high speeds which made handling of the aircraft very difficult. Both test pilots pointed out that only pilots with considerable skill well occurred with the new fighter.

In the meantime, the Red Air Force, despite the various shortcomings of the type, showed a great interest in adding the TXRB-12 to the inventory as soon as possible and negotiations with the Central Department of the Aircraft Industry were started.

After the end of the trails, both prototypes were returned to the factory to improve the weak points of the figures detected during the trials. The list of complaints in the reports were long and included engine overheating, poor handling characteristics at high speed and insecure mountings for the wing guns. The Polikarpov OKB went to work to solve these problems through engineering improvements.

In April of 1934, the State Acceptance Trials were resumed. Due to more favorable weather conditions, the ski-landing gear was replaced by the a retractable wheel landing gear. Due to the fact that all flights were performed with the canopy in the open position, the port entrance

The TXRB-12bis prototype was damaged during a crash landing when the landing gear failed. The carstatus was powered by a Wright-Cyclome SGR-1820-F-2 engine instead of the intended SGGR-1820-F-3 because the F-5 engine had not marked in time. (**A.A. Zrmov**) door was removed, allowing for a quicker built out in the event of an emergency. During a part of the test program, the OP-1 g transition was also removed, but was reinstalled when armament tests were performed.

The test flights of both prototypes soon revealed that a number of problems remained, especially with the landing gear, which had to be carried up and down manually. During ground tests the landing gear reracting mechanism worked properly but, in the air the device often experienced problems. Sometimes, the landing gear could only be fully lowered after performing a high maneuver.

Instability during climb and in turns demanded a high degree of concentration on the part of the input and the rigidly-mounted engine produced an amosingly high vibration level. The handcards operating the landing gear reraction became progressively stiffer as the wheels came up, often resulting in an undulating climb-out since it was difficult not to transmit the cranking motion from one hand to the other holding the control column. The landing gear also tended to stick in a partly-retracted position.

During the State Acceptance trials, the TXRB-12bis suffered a crash landing due to a failed crew, even after some redesign, it shall some flaws. There were also a number of problems with the TXRB-12, such as a slackening of the wings's line covering, especially in the center section. In was determined at the conclusion of the tests that, both the TXRB-12 has first-loss between not ready for production.

The TXRB-12 was returned to the factory to rectify its problem areas and, in September of 1934, both TXRB-12 and the repaired TXRB-12bis, which had been re-enjoined with a Wright-Cyclome SGR-1820-F-3 engine, were transferred to the third time to NII-VVS, where trials were started once more. During modernized a number of improvements were made by the designers. The covering of the center wing section and wing leading edge was now meant, allowing the wing to maintain its proper shape at a wide range of speeds and wing loading. The TXRB-12bis prototype had the three blade Hamilton-Standard propeller, replaced by two blade propeller.

During this flight test program, the TXRB-12 reached 202 mph (325 km/h) at 16.404 feet (5,000 meters), climbed at 1.745 feet per minute, and reached a size of 23.556 feet (7,180 meters). These figures were considerably lower than that of the Wright-Cyclome powered TXRB-12bis, which reached 256 mph (413 km/h) at 16.404 feet with a rate of climb of 2.645 feet per minute and a ceiling of 28.871 feet (8,800 meters).

Finally the two prototypes met the stated requirements and preparations were undertaken by the Ministry for Aircraft Production to start production of the M-22 powered TXRB-12 under the designation I-16 Type 4.

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:7]

## I-16 Type 4

With the I-16 Type 4 (I for _Strehel_/Fighter), entering production, the Soviet Air Force was about to receive its first modern, monophane fighter and the Supreme Command wanted to take delivery of as many of these were aircraft as possible in the shortest period of time.

The first fifty-eight I-16 Type 4s were produced at GAZ-39 (GAZ/_Gosadartsrenny_ _Arienay_ _Zand_/State Aircraft Factory) at Khodinfka during 1934. Then production was shifted to a different production site.

Even though there were still a number of problems with the I-16 that had not yet been fully resolved, preparations for production of the new lighter at GAZ-24 if Naively-Noywood proceeded with two priority and some urgency. An order was issued by the Red Air Force to the Scientific Research Institute to provide technical assistance to the factory to solve the I-16's problems on a high priority basis.

Since the I-16 was the fourth aircraft type built at GAZ-21, the factory's technical documentation referred is the I-16 Type 4, a designation which was later generally adopted by the Soviet Air Force.

Due to the fact that the Wright Cyclone SGR-1820-I-3 power plant and Hamilton-Standard propeller was not yet available in quantity and problems with the license production of the engine at Pemm (under the designation of 2x5) had not been solved, it was decided to power the first pre-production and production I-16s with the well established M-22 engine. The 480 hp M-22 power plant, was in fact a Soviet copy of the British Bristol Jupiter VI and was built in large numbers at State Aircraft Factory 29 in Aleksandroval with 1936. The M-22 was normally fitted with a V-22 fixed tip, which had metal propeller.

There were a number of differences between the TkB-12 prototype and the production I-16 Type 4. The NACA engine cowling was lengthened and tapered toward the rear, a feature adopted from the TkB-12bis prototype, although the first pre-production models of the I-16 Type 4 were delivered with the short engine cowling configuration of the TkB-12 prototype. The dorsal spine of the I-16 Type 4 was slightly enlarged.

Improvements with the undercarriage also led to an enlarged main landing gear leg cover and a wheel cover was installed over the main wheel, so that both wheels and struts were completely covered in flight.

The small upper wing blister over the PV-1 7.62nm machine guns was deleted on the I-16 Type 4. Both TsKB-12 and TsKB-12bis prototypes had two small blisters on the starboard wing tip, these were deleted on the I-16 Type 4 and all subsequent production models.

The TkB-12 prototype carried a forked pit tube, while the I-16 Type 4 and all subsequent production models had a standard unflocked pit tube. The I-16 Type 4 was the first Soviet fighter to feature arm arm protection for the pilot, with an 88m section of armor plate installed behind the pilot's seat.

The I-16 Type 4 was of mixed construction, the fuselage being made of wood and the wings being constructed of metal. The fuselage was built in two hushes divided vertically, each half comprising four longens and eleven pine frames. The monocowise skin was produced from layers of both strips glued cross-grained and molded on a former. The wall thickness ranged from about in the nose section to 2.5ata at the tail.

The wing spars were of KhMA chromo-molybdenum steel alloy, the center section spars being a trussed type and those of the outer set being built up from tubes. The ribs were of dural and the center section and leading edges had Type D1 aluminum alloy slasing, the remainder of the wings being fabric covered. The long-spun, slot type alternons, which also acted as landing flaps, being lowered fifteen degrees on landing, had Type D6 alloy framesand fabric covering, as did the movable tail surfaces. Bell cranks and rigid rods were used for silicon and elevator control, cables and pulleys being employed for the reader.

Cables were also used for the undercameing retraction, since hydraulic retraction systems were not yet in wide spread use. The retraction process took eighteen turns of a hand-crank, which was located below the rhetoric and above the gun charging handles. There was no indicator to inform the pilot when the wheels were fully retracted or extended and locked.

The cockpit was enclosed by a canopy which featured an integral windscreen with an open-**An 1+16 Type 4 up on wing jacks undergoing landing gear drop checks during maintenance. The two small holes in the cowling up are cooling air intakes, not gun ports. (G. F. Petrov)**The first I-16 Type 4 was delivered from GAZ-21 in October of 1934. On 1 May 1935, the 1-16 was presented to the public for the first time, when two flights of five I-16 is fleve over Red Square during the International Labor Dye Cyclotron. In August of that same year, another formation was displayed over Tushing, on the Day of the Air Fleet. A total of 400 I-16 Type 4 were built before the more advanced I-16 Type 5, with the M-25 power plant became available and replaced it on the production lines.

The I-16 Type 4 had a late wife of weight 2.985 pounds (1.344 kg) which was lighter than any Western flight in service in the time. It had a maximum speed of 225 ms (962 km/h), a rate of climb of 2.645 fleve per minute and outstanding mureureworthy (it took only fourteen to fifteen seconds to make a 360 degree turn).

The duct's finish value loading, the I-16 had a landing speed of 66 mph (107 km/h) resulting in the need for longerways than had been needed for the flighter blughes. Since the deliveries of one I-16 Type 4s to combat units could not begin before the Summer of 1935, the Soviet government made a decision to extend the length of runways on their airfields so that the I-16 could be used without problems from advanced airstrips.

The I-16 Type 4 was planned to be an interim production variant until the license built version of the Wright-Cyclone SG-1820-F-3 became available. The I-16 Type 4, however, was suitable for developmental programs, the evolution of new operational techniques and for use in familiarizing pilots with the characteristics of the cantilever low-wing monopine and retractable landing gear.

## Tskb-18

The TsKB-18 was an experimental development of the I-16 Type 4 with an amored cockpit and increased armment. It was the first Soviet fighter equipped armor both in front and behind the cockpit and a bucket seat. The armament was increased to four PV-1 7.62km machine guns and provision for a 2200 plant (100 kg) bomb load.

The Zvonco concept consisted of a carrier aircraft, usually a TB-3-4th-177 bomber and a number of granite figures. The Zvonco-6 combination was two I-16 Type 4 flights, one under each wing. The first flight of a Zvonco-6 block place during August of 1935. (**yuan Ivanov**)

The symbolic term Zvonco (Link) was used to identify composite aircraft component. The cursor was to combine a number of aircraft, linked together in order to increase the range of the filters used to steer heavy power aircraft.

The Zvonco-6 consisted TB-3-4-M-T7 as the carrier with two I-16 Type 4s as parasite aircraft. During the early stage of the trials, at least one TsKB-12 prototype was also involved in the test program. The TsKB-12, as well the I-16 Type 4s, were all modified with the wing machine guns being deleted. A tubular-sset feature was attached beneath each wing of the TB-3 outboard of the outer engines. These frames were used to suspend the two I-16 Type 4s, The I-fibbers were pushed under the wing of the TB-3-4M-17F and then raised to establish contact with the release mechanism. Once secured, the landing gear was retracted. The first flight of this combination took place during August of 1935.

## TsKB-12bis Prototype (Modified)

During the State Acceptance Trials at the Scientific Test Institute of the Red Air Force (NILVVS) the T*KB-12bis prototype, powered by an American Wright-Cyclone SGR-1820-F-2 engine, was damaged in a crash landing when the landing gear collapsed.

As a result, the prototype was returned to the factory for repairs. Besides undergoing repairs, the aircraft was modified to accept the long awaited Wright Cyclone SGR-1820-F-3 engine (the Soviet Union generally referred to this engine as the KCF-3).

In November of 1933, the Soviet Union and the United States opened diplomatic relations and a short time later commercial relations between both countries started as well. For the Soviet Union, this meant that it was now possible to impute some of the latest American engines, as well other items of aviation equipment which were badly needed to achieve it as goals.

The Wright-Cyclone engines were delivered directly by the Wright Aeronautical Corporation in Paterson, New Jersey to the Soviet Union. Raated at 630 HP, the Wright engine had fifty percent more power than the standard Soviet engine of the time (at 480 h) M-2 air-cooled flash. The SGR-1820-F-3 was smaller in diameter than the M-22 and, although it had much better performance, it was only 158 pounds (72 kg) heavier.

Preparations for license production of the SGR-1820-F-3 got under the first pattern Wright engines arrived at the new established end-engine factory, GZ-94 in Petri. It was not until October of 1936, however, that the new engine, designated the M-25, was finally accepted and cleared for production.

The redesign of the T*KB-12bis involved the entire nose section. While the T*KB-12, the original T*KB-12bis and the production I-16 Type 4 all had a constant ORX AC voltage, the modified T*KB-12bis had a new, so called Water-cooling, which was marginally similar to in diameter, tapered toward the rear and equipped with nine forward-facing shatters to control the cooling air flow. The internal exhaust collector was replaced with eight individual exhaust stacks with scalloped exhaust ports in the coupling. The two small air intakes on the upper cooling life were deleted.

During the modification program, a number of other improvements were also incorporated.

**The modified T*KB-12bis prototype differed from the I*15 Type 5 in having more oval exhaust port and two small blisters on the structured wing tip. This prototype carried no national markings. The aircraft served as the pattern for the production I*16 Type 5. (wan Ivanov)**

## I-16 Type 5

During the preparations for the license production of the RCF-3, it became clear that the new power plant could not be as easily produced as had been initially assumed. As a result, it was not until October of 1935, that the new engine, designated the M-25, was finally accepted and cleared for production. As a result, the first pre-series and production I-16 Type 5s were power-red by imported Wright-Cyclone SGR-1820F-3 power plants.

Once the first M-25 power plants became available, production of a batch of M-25 powered pre-series 1-16 Type 5s was undertaken at GAZ-39 in Khodlina. The M-25 was rated at 700 for the fork at the end was equipped with a Stromberg Na-F-7C and aurborate and a Soviet copy of the "Scintilla' ignition system.

These pre-series aircraft formed from the TskB-12bis prototype in having the exhaust port slightly modified. Instead of a rounded rear portion, the port was given a rear drop shape. In addition, the small propeller spinnet used on the TskB-12bis was replaced by a larger spinner oil and production I-16 Type 5s.

While the TskB-12bis prototype lacked landing gear strut covers and had no main wheel cover, the I-16 Type 5 adopted the same landing gear covers that had been introduced on the production I-16 Type 4. In addition, the alkaloid of the TskB-12bis was replaced by a tail-lineline on some pre-production I-16 Type 5s.

A number of pre-series aircraft were test bow by the NiLV-VVS. On the pre-series aircraft, the site of weight had risen from 1,3152 pounds (1,430 kg) to 3,384 pounds (1,535 kg), but due to other improvements, the aircraft meant in a top speed of 283 mph (457 km) without losing any of its maneuverability. This speed was one fifty mph faster than the latest contemporary American fighter in service, the Boering B-26A.

The Soviet government hard made no effort to conceal the development of the I-16 and had, in fact, exhibited a pre-production example of the I-16 Type 5 at the International Aeronautical Salon at Milan, Italy, held between 12 and 28 October 1935. At the Milan Fair. The I-16 drew considerable attention due to its tractable landing gear and glared canopy.

Production of the new type started in early 1936 at both GAZ-21 and GAZ-153. By the 16-16 Type 5s of the thin Fighter Aviation Regiment, Black Sea Fleet warm up their engines before starting a mission from their home base at Kacha afield during 1941. The aircraft in the foreground has had the main landing gear wheel doors removed. (Andrew Zinek)

Time production of the I-16 Type 5 and Type 6 was phased out in late 1937, some 2,200 aircraft had rolled off the production line.

The standard production I-16 Type 5 differed from the pre-series aircraft in having the tail-wheel replaced by a tailside. The firepower was augmented by replacing the two standard PV-1 machine guns with the new SiRxS 7.628MW weapon. The two SiRxS were placed in the wings, outside of the propeller arc and had a rate of fire of 1,800 round per minute, with a ammonium supply of 900 rounds per gun. There was also a provision for carrying a 440 ground (200 kg) bomb load. All I-16 Type 5s were equipped with the OP-1 telecisogenic guns, which was also used on the earlier I-15 and I-152 bplant figures.

The cookight itself was decidedly sang for all but the smallest of pilots. The seat could only be adjusted vertically and equipment was system. The radiimer adjustment instrumentation included altimeter, rate of climb, turn-and bank and oil temperature indicators. These instruments were, for the most part, license-manufactured American Pioneer-Bebark gauges. The cookpit, as well as the plo's seat, was painted at the factory a Greensh Gray, while the instrument panel was Dark Green. The back and headers were generally upholstered in Black leather.

The I-16 Type 5 was less suited to close in high G maneuvering combat that its bisplane contemporaries, although it possessed the advantages of superior speed and climb. Its altern

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:13]

were feather-light and it had an exceptional rate of roll. It also had an outstanding zoom climb capability.

The I-16 Type 5, however, was no aircraft for a novice. It was overly sensitive to control movements and longitudinal stability was marginal. The fighter also tended to stall out in a glide. Instability in a climb and in turns demanded the highest concentration on the part of the pilot and the rigidly-mounted engine produced an amovingly high vibration level.

Unless extreme raw was exercised, use of the split alarms as long on landing approach until in the nose of the fighter pitching up and the aircraft entering a stall. When the undercraft was lowered, the aircraft immediately became sluggish, baffeling was severe and power to be kept up, once there was a masked tendency to drop a wing. The I-16 had to be literally flow onto the ground, stalling at anything up to 93 mph (150 km/h), and as only one of the three legs of each main landing gear member incorporated an else shock absorber, the damping of the landing power was inadequate and the aircraft tended to bounce, often resulting in a dangerous nose-up attitude.

Because of these handling problems, the service introduction of the I-16 Type 5 was to prove difficult and the high adsorbent rate it experienced during its initial stages brought near-rebellin in the ranks of the Red Air Force fighter pilots.

### Engine Cowlings

Another shortcoming, in the opinion of many average pilots, was the enclosed cockpit. Before the introduction of the I-16, all Soviet fighter had open cockpit. Plots believed that the sliding canopy would restrict movement and they would be unable to move their heads from side to side to check the rear. Most pilots did not believe that the wind shield always worked efficiently, especially if they had to bad out.

To convince average service pilots, test pilots P. Giannozzi, S. Soprun, V. Yvesyev, Y. Perona and V. Vakhov began upon the Red Air Force fighter units to demonstrate the Red 4, an I-16 Type 5 was captured by the Germany at Riga Artifield in Latvia. The aircraft in the background latitude several British-built Gloster Glostator Ibplane fighters of the former Latvia Air Force, which had been captured by the Russians when they invaded Latvia. (Ginter Wiesinger)
This 1+16 Type 5 was captured at Siaultail in Lithuanian. The tip of the fin was in Red with a thin White stripe. The rear landing gear start doors have been removed from this fighter. (Wolfgang Tamme) advantages of the 1+16 in November of 1937. Soon the doubts and fears of 1+16 Type 5 plots were dissolved. During their four through various Fisher Aviation Regimeters, the test plots were dissolved. During their four through various Fisher Aviation Regimeters, the test plots were all on the basis of the 1+16 Type 5 which has a gun camera mount behind the cockpit. The quasipatial has been removed by the Lulufatta, a common measure meant to render the aircraft ineffective. This aircraft carries no tactical number. (Helan Birthuis)

Afan of Soviet paint was imported from Nazi-Germany, as a result, the colors applied on Soviet pre-war figures was very similar to German aircraft colors. Until the Sommer of 1941, the national markings were applied on top of the upper and bottom of the lower wing as well as on the fushese. The Red star is a national marking always had a thin Black outline. The tactical number was usually applied on the rudder and had a thin White outline. During operational service, the main wheel cover was sometimes removed as a field condition, since the covers were quite defined during operations from unreported fields. When the gun camera pad because, the 1+16 Type 5 was recruited with the gun camera on the dorsal spine behind the pilots seat.

Only a few 1+16 Type 5 were retrofitted with a short wave RIS-3 (ISIS **- Rodisancia dija Istrabebei**Radio for fighter), identifying the installation of a small mast on top of the vertical fin. The RIS-5 consisted a received and a transmitter. Usually, only the lead plane in a torus equipped with both, sender and receiver equipment, while the remaining planes had either only a receiver or no radio at all. Both the RIS-3 receiver and transmitter were powered by the RUN-30 accumulator. Sender and transmitter had five fixed frequencies which had to be selected on the ground before a mission.

Some 1+16 Type 5 were fitted with a small trim on the flap as a field modification. This trim on the inward flap became standard tuned on two pen-16-16.

The 1+16 Type 5 was still in active front-line service when the Germans invaded Russia on 22 June 1941. A number of 1+16 Type 5s fell into enemy marks during the early stage of the war, when the Germans occupied airfields in Belomissa, the Ukraine, Lithuanian and Lulufai. At Riga, the Latvian capital, a large number of 1+16 Type 5s shared the airfield with British-built Gloster Glulators, which had been ejected by the Red Army during its invasion of the Baltic countries.

## Appendix A Ground-Attack I-16 Type 5

Two 1-16 Type 5s were experimentally equipped with six ShXs 7.62km matching guns, mounted in the wing center section and outer wing panels. These guns were able to be extra-end up to 20 degrees. This variant, which was produced in late 1936 as a ground-attack aircraft, was not built in quantity.

A ground-extremal instability the port ShVAX 20ma cannon in the wing bay of the 1-16p prototype. The 1-16p was the first Soviet fighter aircraft to carry a 20ma cannon. (van Ivanov)

The T&B-29 was developed as a high speed dive bomber and was powered by an imported Wright-Cyclone SGR-1820-7-s engine. This version of the 1-16 Type 5 was manufactured and test flow during 1936 and differed in having pneumatic landing gear and flap retraction, the flaps being separated from the siderex. It was armed with two ShXs 7.62km machine guns and a 440 pound (200 kg) bomb load could be carried on hardpoints under the wings.

### I-16p (Cannon)

The I-16p was a based on the I-16 Type 5 airframe powered by an imported Wright-Cyclone SGR-1820-7-3, The I-16p differed from the standard production I-16 Type 5. The first tests were carried out successfully, but the recoil operated common was not mounted in a production aircraft (1-16 Type 17) for another two years.

### Zveno I-16 Type 5

I-16 Type 5s were also used for _Zveno_ parasite figures with the carrier aircraft normally Tuoplexy's large TB-1 and TB-3 bombers. The figures were attached under the wings of the carrier aircraft, and released by the pilot. They were secured on three points, the rear one was unlocked first, followed by the two front ones.

Technically take offs and landings of the carrier with its load of figures never caused any major problems. There were, however, incidents when wheels or propellers caused minorThe _Zveno-6 SPR_ consisted of a TB-3-4AM-34MN bomb with two 1-16 Type 5s suspended under the wings. The 1-16s were armed with a pair of FAB-290 NE bombs. The first flight of this combination took place during July of 1937 from Zhukovsky airfield. (when January)

damage to the corrugated skin of the carrier when the fighters were released or blocked back back on. The most difficult part of the mission was when the fighters joined the carrier.

The _Zveno-6_ used a Tupole TB-3-4AM-17K as the carrier aircraft plus two early production 1-16 Type 5s. The 1-16 Type 5s were suspended under the wings of the Tupole bomber.

The _Zveno-7_ was a single TB-3-4AM-34MN with three 1-16 Type 5s, which were all backed on and released during the flight. This combination, however, was discontinued.

The _Zveno-7_ achieved a Tupole TB-3-4AM-17 Carrier with two 1-16s fitted under the inner wings and two 1-5s on top of the wing outer panels. When the aircraft took off its mission flight on 20 November 1993, a further 1-26 wave has cooled on the ing and later, together with the remaining four fighters, released.

There was a _Zveno_ variant developed to attack small targets, using two 1-16s as dive bombs. The TB-3 would carry the two fighters near the target, where the 1-16s, and with bombs, should be released and attack the targets in a sharp dive. After accomplishing the _Zveno-6_ was found to be capable of speeds of 167 mph (268 km). (van Ivanov)

While the carrier version of the nose lock on device lacked the rear support struts, all later versions included these struts for added strength. In the event, the fuselage hook on method for the 1-16 was abandoned, relying on only the underlying method. (when January)

mission, the I-16s wouldn return to the inserted freshly base. The _Zveno-6 SPB (Sustamer) PalirizusBondium/Composite_ Dirk Bombers led a TB-3-4AM-348PN two 1-16 Type 5s and will two 5-280 HE bombs. These I-16 Type 5s had their wing guns detected during the trials and the first flight took place during July of 1937. The total take of weight of the _Zveno-6_SPB_ exceeded twenty-two toss, and the composite reach a speed of 166.5 mph (268 km). During the trials, it was reported that some minor percent of the bombs dropped fell within the target area, an outline of a destroyer sligh painted on the ground.

The _Zveno-6 SPB_ was introduced during the Air Parade Over Tusition on occasion of the Day of Aviation on 18 August 1940. During the demonstration, a mask was shown by other Soviet fighters against the TB-3-4AM-34RN. At that moment, the two 1-16 Type 5s, were released and engaged the "eenay."

There were two 1-16 Type 5s converted to allow them to hook on during flight to the fuselage pickup point on a TB-3-3 in a similar procedure to that used with the I-Z fighter on the _Zveno-7_.

The _Zveno-7_ obtained a Tupole-7_. For these trials, an I-16 Type 5s was modified in a hook-box device in front of the canopy, which was strengthened by two additional struts leading to each side of the canopy frame. The wing guns were deleted on the particular testbed. The second version was equipped with a strengthened boom with two struts mounted between the two main attachment struts.

Gradually it was learned that the upper variants, with the fighters mounted on top of the carrier's wing, caused more problems the offert required to mount the fighters on top of the TB-3 wing. The 'lower' variant, with two 1-16 Type 5s suspended under the wing, was consid

own. Over the target the 1-16 figures were met by heavy flak. The artillery battery was not located and the I-16s bombed German tank concentrations. This last attack was lead by Captain Arseny V. Shubikov, who unfortunately was reported as missing in action during this trial.

During the war, more as thirty _Zveno_ missions were flown. Due to their wartime exploits, the 32nd Fighter Aviation Regiment was renamed the 11th Guards Figurer Aviation Regiment. The TB3-3-A4M-34RN were all transferred behind the Caucas mountains, based at Teredky-Kornard airfield.

## Spanish I-16 Type 5s

Spain had become a Republic during 1931, and for the next two years the first elected government proposed reforms intended to bring the country into the modern world. During 1936, it has been found that the Spanish political Left was dominated by the two general trade unions, the CNT, influenced by the anarchism of Baknin, and the UGT, which was Marxist but not Bolblevich. For the elections of February 1936, the Left came together, at the communists suggestion, in a Popular Front. Using this tactic, they gained 278 seats, of which the communists held seventeen.

On 18 July 1936, Nationalist fractions under Generalism Francisco reached against the demographic government of the Second Spanish Republic and, in late August, the Soviet Union elected to intervene actively in support of the Republican forces. The reaction of the Soviet Union was dictated more by its fear of the growth of the Nazis and their Anti-Commentment Patt with Italy, than by the opportunity to promote a communist government Spain.

In August of 1936, the Soviet Union established diphenatic relations with Spain and sent an ambassador with a formidable stuff. This staff included General Yan K. Berrin, who had just hit his post as bad of the Civil (Soviet Military Intelligence). He later played an upper limit on the defense of Madrid, Vladimir A. Antonov-Vosenko, a leader of the October 1917 Revolution was appointed as Consal-General in Barcelona. Like so many other Soviet military advisors in Spain, both were later recalled to Moscow and subsequently executed.

The Commander in Chief of the Soviet at component in Spain was Volcano Yakody Shumshikweichs, Aless General Douglas, Due to his experience in Spain, he was appointed commander of the Red Arl Force in September 1939, but after the ill-fitted Winter Warf against Finland, he was removed from this post and subsequently executed in October of 1941.

By late October of 1936, the first consignment of thirty-one I-16 Type 5s had arrived at the port of Caragona. The ninth fighter was named by the Spanish Republicmas the _Moteca (Fly)_. These figures were used to form two fighter squadars of the _Fastera Across Republicmas_ (FARE), _In Escandilla de Messos_ (1st _Moteca_ Squadron) which was based at Alcala de Henares and the _2a Escandilla de Messos_ (2nd _Moteca_ Squadron) based at Campsooto.

On their first combat mission, 15 November 1936, I-16 Type 5s of the _Ia Escandilla de Moucas_ were engaged by three Firat CR3,3s, but the fight ended without loss to either side.

**This Republican-16 Type 5**, Black 3s, was found abandoned by advancing Italian troops of the _Corpo Trappe Volontaviat_. (Carlo Lucchini)
This captured 1-16 Type 5 was given the code Black 1W-1, and was tested by the Nationalists at Cuatro Ventros Airfield. The two piece pilot tube was a local modification. (**Musso del Aire**)

The following the _La EstosCardilla de Moresa_ shot down two Fiat CR32. During this time all the 1-16s were being flown by Soviet pilots. On 17 November, an 1-16 of _24 Esc Escadilla de Moresa_ was shot down when the pilot made the fatal mistake of engaging in a close-timing algorithm with a highly maneuverable Fiat CR32.

_Mores pilots quickly figured out that the best procedures for combating the Fiat CR32. Their tactics consisted of a diving attack, using cloud cover to advantage. After making a single firing pass, they would climb back to altitude using the speed gained in the dye._

In December of 1936, the first IC type 5, Black 9 was captured by the Nationalists. This _Mosca_, which was later repainted in Nationalist markings and coded 1W-1, was evaluated by a test group at Cuatro Ventros. For the flight tests the standard pilot tube was replaced by a two piece pilot tube.

The Nationalist generally referred to the 1-16 by the nickname _Rate_ (Ra) or Boeing because it is supposed American P-260A origin. By this time it was generally assumed in the Western Europe and America that the 1-16 was built according to Boeing company specifications. But in fact, the 1-16 was a generation ahead of the technology used in the Boeing P-26A.

In December of 1936, a further thirty-one I-16 Type 5 were delivered, these aircraft being used to form _2 EscaCardilla de Moresa_ based at Albacete, which was committed into action in February of 1937. The Soviet Union had delivered a total of sixty two-16 Type 5s. By 1937 at least four had been destroyed in combat, and only twenty-four were reported as operational, while the test were in varying stages of assembly.

The first non-Soviet pilots began to join the 1st and 3rd _Mosca_ Squadrons in May of 1937. These nine included such experienced flight spots such as the Spaniards Manuel Agquire and Education, and the Americans Frank Three and Albert Baumuller. In mid-May the 3rd _Mosca_ Squadron moved to the Northern Sector, making a direct flight from Algate near Madrid to Bilbao. Of the twelve aircraft that began the mission, seven managed to accomplish the 18th mile trip, but five were forced to return.

By the late June, there were only some fifty I-16s still narrowly. At least thirteen I-16 Type 5s had been lost in combat or in accidents. During the 6-28 July 1937 the I-16s had their first serious encounters with Messerschmitt B-109s.

The I-16 Type 5 had been decisive in gaining air superiority for the Republicans, at least over the Madrid region. From November of 1936 until the Summer of 1937 I-16s were the superior fighter in Spain. This forced the Third Reich to send the Messerschmitt B 109 to Spain in order to regain air superiority over the inimble _Mosca_.

When sufficient numbers of the more advanced I-16 Type 6 and I-16 Type 10 arrived in Spain, a number of the remaining I-16 Type 5s were allocated to the high speed fighter training camp at El Carmoli near Cartagena.

Chinese I-16 Type 5

On 7 July 1937, Japan begun its invasion of China, without a declaration of war. At the time of the invasion, the Chinese Air Force was a very mixed bag of foreign aircraft and was dependent on aircraft imported from distant countries.

A non-aggression pack had been signed between the Soviet Union and the Chinese Kaouimating Government on 21 August 1937, and under the terms of one of the secret clauses of the pack, the Soviet Union was to send military aid to China with an emphasis on the re-equipping the Chinese Air Force, which had been virtually annihilated by the Japanese.

During 1937, the first I-16 Type 5s had reached China and the 4th fighter Group became the first Chinese unit to operate the I-16. This unit covered from the American Curtis Hawk II biplane fighter, which had been delivered in March of 1936.

Six I-16 Type 5s of the 4th fighter Group, led by Colonel Kao, had just arrived from Ankang on 21 November 1937 and were being refueled at Chochiakou airfield in Hoana when ten Mitshishi G3M2 bomers appeared overhead. Colonel Kao was killed when his fighter was among those destroyed on the ground during the bombing. Eleven bomers's came back to the same airfield the next day, but this time three I-16 Type 5s were on patrol and a single Mitshishi G3M2 was dowd.

On 22 November 1937, Soviet fighter pilots scored their first victory. Twenty-three I-16 Type 5s were based at Nanjing airfield and under the command of Captain G.M.Prokovic.

Six Japanese Type 96 fibersengaged as six of the I-16 Type 5s, and a Type 96 flown by Myrajasi was lost. Japanese forces returned to Naming with nine Mitshishi Type 96 fibers, six Alch Type 96 fibre bomber and two Mitshishi G3M2 bomers on 24 November 1937 and according Japanese sources, three of the six interpeting-16 Type 5s were dowd down.

As Japanese forces moved towards the capital city in December of 1937, Naming was the site of repeated combats. Eight Yokosuka BaY1 attack biplanes second by six Mitshishi type 96 fibers from the 13th Air Group attacked on 2 December 1937 and the I-16s rose to intercept. The Japanese fiberings claimed they donned a number of I-16 without loss.

Chinese I-16s were camoufaged in standard Soviet colors, Olive Green uppersurfaces and Light Blue undersurfaces. The national markings were only carried on the wing undersurfaces, not on the wing uppersurfaces. The White-Blue horizontal stripes were applied to the rudder.

I-16 Type 6

The I-16 Type 6 replaced the I-16 Type 5 on the production line at GAZ-21 and GAZ-153 and, when the production of the I-16 Type 5 and Type 6 was phased out in late 1937, some 2,200 examples of both versions had been built, with one third of them being I-16 Type 6s.

One of the shortcoming of the I-16 Type 5, in the opinion of many average pilots, was the enclosed cockpit and, in operational service, most Soviet pilots flew with the canopy pushed to the front.

As a result, to answer pilots complaints, the Polikarpov Design Bureau returned to the open-cogli and replaced the forward sliding canopy with a fixed, single piece substract, which provided the pilot with a fleet overall view. The OP-1 synthesis was retained. Another change from the I-16 Type 5 was the introduction of an improved 730 hp M-25A engine.

During its production run, a number of small changes were introduced to the I-16 Type 6. The OP-1 synthesis was replaced by a more adapted PACK-1 (_Prizic Arielvianaryary_) Agilent (Aquisib) which was a copy of the French Chiar Ginship. PAK-1 equipped I-16 Type 6s could be identified by the fact that barrel of the OP-1 proriding through the windstream was deleted, since the smaller PAK-1 was housed behind the windscreen. The PAK-1 became the main type of gunlight used on all I-16 variants from the I-16 Type 6 onwards.

Late production versions of the I-16 Type 6s had a trim tab on the inner portion of the flaps and a number of early Type 6s were retrofitted with this modification in the field.

The I-16 Type 6 could also be equipped with a gun camera mounted on the fuselage dorsal spine behind the cockpit. Since the gun camera was retrofitted to a number of earlier variants,

**This damaged 16 Type 9, White 29, was loaded into a truck for transport back to a repair depot. The external care to two two Dark Green, White Green temperature camouriage.**

The fuselage star had a thin Black outline. (Robert Bock)

The presence of a gun camera is not an identification feature of the Type 6.

For Winter operations, the I-16 Type 6s could be equipped with a ski landing gear. Like earlier variants, the landing gear was fixed in the lowered position when skis were fitted.

The armament of the I-16 Type 6 was the same as the earlier-16 Type 5, two SKA53 and 7,62hot pairs. Before the line became available in guards. I-16 Type 6 was used in the ground support role. Many ground attack Type 6 had the propeller winner detected, however, this was not a standard feature. For ground attack divides the I-16 Type 6 could be armed with either four or six Type R0-82 rocket trials under the wings for RS-82 unpaid air-to-ground rackets. The RS-82 had a 1.280 bound (\(<\).585 kg) warhead and a range of 5,686 yts (5,200 meters).

I-16 Type 6s left the production lines painted in Olive Green hypersurfaces and Light Blue undersurfaces. The Red star national markings had a thin black outline and was varied on the rear fuselage and both the wing upper and undersurfaces. In most cases a single diet mechanical number applied to the tail.

After the start of the Second World War (Great Patriotic War), a number of I-16 Type 6 used by front-line units were reprinted in a two tone camouflage on the uppressurfaces. In many cases a Dark-Green color was added on the existing Olive Green. The Red star was added to the redder and deleted from the wing appearances. The factual number was most often carried on the fuselage, however, there were no strict guidelines for camouflage and markings during in the first months of the war.

Over the course of the Second World War (Great Patriotic War) most 1+16 Type 6s were given a two tone uppersurface camoufinge scheme of Dark Green and Olive Green. The Red star on the fins was larger than normal and the aircraft also carries a Red star outlined in White and Black on the spinner. The latiring on the dorsal spine behind the cockpft is a spin camera installation. (V. Simececels)

## Appendix B Spanish I-16 Type 6

The first delivery of thirty-one 1-16 Type 6s arrived in Spain in two lots, seventeen on 21 May 1937, aboard the freighter ANTONIO SARTRUSTEQUI and fourteen on 8 July, aboard the CABO SANTO TOMILE. After their arrival in the Spanish port of Alicene these 1-16s were all assembled at Archaea. The 1-16 Type 6s was used to form the _& Escambia de Mesos_ (4th _Mosc_ Squadron) and to replace losses in the 1-61s.

In late August of 1937, six 1-16 Type 5s and 1-16 Type 6s had been lost in combat in the North, only eight remaining aircraft. Seven more steel in the North and two in the Center during September.

By the beginning of October, there were fifty-one _Moscus_ in an airworthy condition between the Central and Northern Secures. During this same time, two additional units, the _5a_

_Escientific de Mesos and 6a Escourdilla de Mesos_ were formed. Also in October 1937, three additional _Moscus_ were shot down over the Northern Sector and mature was lost over the Central front. In addition, four were captured and re-16 pilot debated to France. As of December 1937, forty-eight _Moscus_ of all types remained were uniformly the _Faruca Republican_ (FARE) and, as a result, the _de Escourdilla de Mesos_ was decactivated.

When sufficient numbers of the more advanced 1-16 Type 10 arrived in Spain, a number of the surviving 1-16 Type 6s were transferred to the high speed fighter training camp at E1 Carmoli near Cartagena. During training operations, most 1-16 Type 6s had the main wheel covers removed.

Chinese I-16 Type 6

Along with the I-16 Type 5, a number of early I-16 Type 6s were also delivered to China in October of 1937. These early production I-16 Type 6s were still equipped with the OP-19anish adopted from the I-16 Type 5. About 450 Soviet pilots and technicians assembled via train at Alma Ata in Kazakhstan. They were to deliver the first of 225 Soviet aircraft to China. These included: 115 figures, a number of which I-16 Type 5s and I-16 Type 6s, sixty-two bombers and eight advanced trainees. These weeks were tracked into China over the old ski ski to the end of the Chinese railway in late Lunchow.

Together with the I-16 Type 5, the I-16 Type 6s saw considerably combat against Japanese Army and Navy bombers and their securing fighters. On 18 February 1938, fifteen Japanese bombers with an escort of eleven Matsuili'sASH fighter attacked the Matsuili (Hanakaw). Nineten 1152x and I-16 The 4th Figure Group Intercepted the attackers. Admitted losses for the engagement included four Japanese and five Chinese fighter pilots killed in action, including the 4th Epidemic Group commander.

Nanchang was the target of thirty-five Misuishi G3M2 bombers and eighteen ASM fighters on 25 February 1938. These were then by nineteen 1152x and eleven 116 Type 5s and I-16 Type 6s. A single Polikynor fighter was shot down while another four damaged. During the first two months of 1938, defending Chinese fighters flew 250 senties on twenty-seven defensive missions, admitting the loss of thirty-one aircraft and twenty-two pilots, while claiming thirty Japanese aircraft destroyed.

## Finnish I-16 Type 6

In October of 1939, anticipating war with Nazi Germany, Salin and the Soviet Foreign Minister Vyachoslav Molotov proposed the Fins to code the Soviet Union a strip of southern Finland. This land was to serve as a buffer and protect the approaches to Leinograd. Negotiations reached an impasse and on 30 November 1939, the Soviet Union invaded Finland.

The Soviet effort began with sessions of a quick victory, but soon the Soviet military found itself as the Fins displayed free resistance. The Finnish Army, numbering a mere 2000,000 soldiers, held on under heavy Soviet pressure.

By 12 March 1940, the Fins could no longer hold out and coded the Rausiansians the buffer ago they wanted. Losses for the Soviet Air Force, however, during the 104 days of combat were enormous. Between 700 and 900 aircraft were lost and the Red Army reported that some 47,878 soldiers were killed in action.

On 25 June 1941, following the German attack to the Soviet Union, Finland declared war on the Soviet Union and advanced to the old 1939 frontier on the Australian lithium. In response, cars on 25 February 1938, These were then by nineteen and five of aircraft. With this event, the Commission Warten between the Soviet Union and Finland started. In spite of a strong German presence, the Finsish Army only carried out military operations that were in their interests.

During the Continuation War with the Soviet Union, there were five I-16 of various sub-types captured by the Fins, but only one was in university condition. This I-16 Type 6, Red 15, was in White winter camowiling with Light Blue understures when it was captured intact at Suvanesian on 25 March 1942. It was previously used by the Red 144 Force for ground attack duties and carried three RO-82 missile pairs under each wing. This I-16 Type 6 was

I-16 Type 10

Combut experience in Spain revealed that the fire power of the I-16 Type 5 and I-16 Type 6's two ShKaS 762bst machine guns was rather inadequate for modern combat. This shortcoming led to the I-16 Type 10, which was, in total numbers of aircraft produced, the most important variant of the I-16 fighter series.

In order to improve the fire power of the I-16, a pair of synchronized ShKaS 762bst guns with 650 rounds per gun, were installed in the upper nose firing through the propeller. The machine gun maximizes twice visible protruding through the bowling.

Additionally two fairrings were added to the upper nose to cover the gun speech installation and a small blister was placed to the left of the port gun and to the right of the stathbour gun firing. The machine gun flarings and the small blisters were quick identification features for the I-16 Type 10 when compared with the I-16 Type 5 and Type 6 versions.

Most I-16 Type 10 were positioned with the PAK-1 russight, but late production aircraft received the more advanced PAK-la and PAK-in versions of this gunlight.

The conversion from the I-16 Type 6 to the new Type 10 at GAZ-1 was done in a remarkable-ably short period of time. In a late issued an 25 December 1937, Kliment E. Voroshilov, chairman of the R6d Air Force, stated that upper need to convert the production line at GAZ-1 21 from the I-16 Type 6 to the more advanced I-16 Type 10. Factory director Y.M.

Mitsoshnikov replied that such a conversion was planned within a year. Voroshilov and the Commissas replied that the deadline for conversion was two days!

In the event, the task was carried out by New Years for 1938. On that day, the first I-16 Type 10 with four machine guns concluded its first static test rings. On 11 January, the first prototype built at GAZ-1 was test from by S. Suyan and by March of 1938 thirty-one I-16 Type 10 was taken after the production line and shipped to Spain.

The I-16 Type 10 also differed from the earlier variants in the shape of the exhaust ports on the engine couling. On the I-16 Type 5 and Type these were large, tear drop shaped openings, but the I-16 Type 10 and all subsequent production models onward, these were replaced by smaller openings with an more rounded rear section. This modification became necessary since the initial configuration had allowed carbon monoxide to enter the cockpit.

The internal structure of the I-16 Type 10 was strengthened. Also standard in the I-16 Type 10 was a cable-cutter for the pilot. Previous operations with the I-16 showed that the landing

power was increased from 63 ps to 73 ps, while the empty weight rose from 959 pounds (43 ps to 1.012 pounds) (459 kg) for the M-25V. Aircraft with the M-25V engine could be identified by a small T shaped air intake on the lower nose under the polymer.

The 1-16 Type 10 was the first variant to be fitted with a retractable ski landing gear. In the Red 4 was used as a fission aircraft. The large Red star with thick White outline indicates this aircraft was in service during 1944. The aircraft also carried a Vel Velour identification band around the rear fuselage.

retracted position. Flying characteristic of the ski version was similar to those of the wheeled versions.

Late production I-16 Type 10s had an AV-1 propeller installed in place of the standard V-25 propeller. Externally the modification was identifiable by the use of a larger propeller spin-ner. This propeller beame standard on the I-16 Type 18. The older V-25 propeller of the standard I-16 Type 10 could only change pitch while on the ground, while the AV-1 pitch could be changed dynamically by the plott during the flight. When the summer was removed, the AV-1 propeller could distinguish by two normal balance weight on the propeller bath.

A number of I-16 Type 10 were equipped with a camera mounted on the starboard wing tip for use as fast reconnaissance aircraft. This conversion was done as a field modification and was not only limited to the I-16 Type 10, but a number of I-16 variants (Type 18, Type 24 and Type 28) were also converted for reconnaissance duties. The armament of four ShKaS 7.62N pass was retained.

During the rough field operations, the main landing gear doors were sometimes removed from the aircraft in order to avoid damage.

TsKB-12P

The TxKB-12P was a modified variant of the I-16 Type 10, powered by an imported Wright-Cyclone SGR-1820-F3 and only a single prototype was produced. The TxKB-12P differed from the standard production I-16 Type 10 in its armament. The aircraft was modified by having the two wing mounted two ShKaS machine guns replaced by two 20km ShVAK common with 150 rounds each. Further tests with the TxKB-12P were carried out, including a modification with four 20km ShVAK Camons.

The I-16TK was developed from the 1-16 Type 10 with the inset of improving the high altitude characteristics of the fighter. The I-16TK was powered by an M-25V power plant, equipped with two TK-11 counterexcharges developed by the Central Aero Engine Institute (TANAI). To save weight, the I-16TK and the huge mounted melting guns detected. The I-16TK had the exhaust thus placed on each side of the engine coming replaced by a ten-kTK was equipped with an AV-1 propeller, identified by the two beamless agent on the hub.

In addition, a large air intake was placed on each side of the upper engine cowling. A large heat resistant steel panel was mounted behind the TK-1 nutosupercharger exhaust. The aircraft was fitted with an AV-1 propeller without a spiner and the landing gear was strengthened to handle the increased weight.

During operation, both TK-1 nutosuperchargers were switched on simultaneously. During flight testing the I-16TK reached 306.9 mph (494 km/h) at 28.215 feet (8.600 m), the maximum ceiling obtained was 360.696 (11.000 m), which was a considerably boost in performance when compared with the standard I-16 Type 10, which had a maximum speed of 278 mph (448 km/h) at 10.367 feet (3,160 m) and a maximum ceiling of 27.099 feet (8.260 m). As more powerful M-62 and M-63 power plants became available, the I-16TK program was phased out. There was only one I-16TK built.

### I-16 Type 20

The I-16 Type 20 was an experimental version of the production I-16 Type 10 built to test the concept of extending the fighter's range with auxiliary fuel tanks. This experimental version differed from the standard I-16 in having provisions to carry two 52.8 gallon (200 liter) slipper-type auxiliary fuel tanks under the rugs which increased the maximum attainable range to about 745.6 miles (1.200 km). Standard I-16 Type 10 had no provision for wet points' in the wings. A I-16 Type 20 was tested in the Winter of 1937, this overall Silver test-bed carried to arrangment or passight and the rear portion of the nose gun fainings were removed. It was also equipped with modified main landing gear wheel covers.

## Spanish I-16 Type 10

During late March of 1938, the first consignment of thirty-one unassembled I-16 Type 10s arrived in Spain after being shipped through France. These I-16 Type 10s were among the first examples of the new fighter built on the G2A-21 production line. These early 16 Type 10s were all powered by the M-25A engines. The unit price of each I-16 was fixed at 540,000 which had to be paid by the Republican Government to the Soviet Union in American currency. Sparte parts for the _Mossus_ had also to be paid in American currency, an M-25 power plant cost 56,200 and a single ShKsA 7.62km gun 51,000. Juan Negin, the Republican Finance Minister arranged for the transfer of the Spanish gold reserves to the Soviet Union. Which were then used to purchase arms in the Soviet Union and by transferring funds via Soviet Banks to Paris, to bypass arms in other countries. During the course of the Spanish Civil War, the Soviet Union supplied Spain with various weapons routing some 518,500,000.

The _Terrence Across Republicans_ (FARE) named the new type received the _Super Mesca_. After assembling of the first I-16 Type 10, the new figures were immediately assigned to the _Kosmophila de Moscow_ and the _Essencitilla de Moscow_. With the additional aircraft delivered from the Soviet Union it was also possible to activate the _de Escundilla de Moscow_ in July of 1937. This unit was later abandoned in December 1937, due to a lack of available aircraft.

The first combat with the I-16 Type 10 revealed that there were problems in synchronizing the frengle mounted ShKsA 7.62km machine guns. As a result, a number of I-16 Type 10s was

**Chinese I-I6 Type 10**

Following the signing of a mutual assistance packet between the Soviet Union and China in August of 1937, some 200 I-I6s of various variants supplied to the Chinese Air Force. Most, however, were I-16 Type 10s. The first I-16 Type 10s were delivered to China in the Spring of 1938.

The I-16 Type 10 replaced the Curtis Hark II in first-line combat units. The 4th Chinese Fighter Wing became the first unit to operate the I-16 after they had converted from the Hawkthat become "disdislusioned and frustrated". They saw their aircraft missed and crashed by experienced Chinese pilots who would not follow or had not und undocosed Soviet instructions. They also saw material being bonded instead of being used in combat.

Chinese pilots faced the formidable Mitsubishi A6M1 Zero for the first time on 13 September 1940, when thirteen pre-production Zeros executed twenty-seven Mitsubishi G3M2 bombers to Chumbing. Nine 1-16 and nineteen 1-153E from the Higher Group scrambled to intercept the bombers, but within minutes they were attacked by Japanese fibers. A total of thirteen Chinese fibers were destroyed and a further eleven damaged. Ten Chinese plots were killed and eight, including the commander of the 4th Fibier Group, were wounded.

In another engagement, eight Zeros recorded twenty-seven bombers to Chseni on 4 October 1940 and about four five of the intercepting 1-16s. Nineteen additional 1-16s were destroyed on the ground. On 7 October 1940, Kunming was attached by twenty-seven bombers served by Zeros, which claimed thirteen 1-16s and Curtis Hays.

From 19 August 1940 to the end of the year, 153 Zero stories were known and their pilots claimed a total of fifty-three Chinese aircraft, which was _Roy June_ of 1941, the Chinese Air Week at head of eight-of-five Chinese lobed: 1533 and 1-16s fibers remaining to eight against ever increasing numbers of Japanese bombers and their Zero scores.

Chinese fibers seldom got close enough to engage the Japanese long range bombers covered by the Zeros. On 11 August 1941, seven G4M1 bombers over Chepati were attacked by I-16s, which were engaged by sixteen Zero events, which show other three I-16s (another two were excited to the bombner). This was the last challenge by Chinese fighter that year. The I-16s was definitely obsolete and the Chinese Air Force ceased to exist as a threat to Japanese air units.

Chinese I-16 Type 10 will carried standard Red Air Force camouflage (Olive Green upper-surfaces and Light Blue underferences). Chinese rounders were carried only on the wing underwater. Blue-White stripes were carried on the holder and a small White Chinese serial number was painted on the fin.

**Hispano Suznan manufactured Super Mosca differed from the original Soviet-16 Type 10 in having the PAK-1 guntight replaced by the earlier OP-1 guntight, which was standard on the I-16 Type 5 and I-16 Type 6. (Museo del Aire)**

Spanish production of the I-16 Type 10 started during the Summer of 1938, at the _Sericio de Axelierio y Fabbrien_ SAF-15 factory at Alicante. Initially it was planned to built 100 I-16 Type 10 under license, but this figure was never achieved. The Spanish experienced great difficulty in the heat treatment of the center-action wigne guns, which were made in Alicante, but had to be sent by ship through the Nationals blockade to Barcelona, where the only suit-diance was moved. Then the parts were returned to the Hispano-Suzia plant at Alicante.

Spanish-built _Super Mosca_ were in fact, based on early I-16 Type 10 pass under we equipped with the M-25A engine. While all Soviet-built I-16 Type 10 were equipped with the PAK-1 gun, the Hispano-Suzia manufactured _Super Mosca_ were all filled with the earlier OP-1 guntight, which was standard from the 15-16 Type 5 and the early 16-16 Type 6. Also a direct copy from the early 1-16 Type 5 and the end of I-16 Type 6. Also a direct copy from the early 1-16 Type 5 and the end of I-16 Type 6 as the use of wide chord flaps. Soviet-built \(C\) type 10 was used at equipment with similar flange.

The first four Spanish-built _Super Mosca_ were delivered to the _Ia Escudrilla de Moscas_ and the _Escudrilla de Moscas_ in October of 1938. Ten more were completed by 10 February 1939, when the loss of Catalan brought production at the Hispano Suzia plant to a halt.

Thirty-Five _Super Mosca_ affirates were found in various stages of assembly by the Nationals. These were transferred to the _Tailures Experimentales Del Aire_, which occupied the buildings in the converted Gonzalez Warsaw library began at Jeree de la Frontera for final assembly. The assembled _Super Mosca_ were all transported to nearby La Perra Airfield for flight testing and acceptance. The first Jeree-built _Super Mosca_ were completed during 1941 and delivered to the _Ejercito del Aire_ (Spanish Air Force).

**The first Jeree manufactured Super Mosca on the ramp at La Perra Air Base shortly before its first flight. The Spanish-built I-16 Type 10 adopted the long chord flaps used on the earlier I-16 Type 5 and I-16 Type 6 as standard. (Museo del Aire)**

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:37]

## I-16 Type 17

The I-16 Type 17 was a variant of the I-16 Type 10 modified for the ground support role. Combet experience in the Spanish Civil War had clearly shown that the standard armament of SWMAS 7.62Man guns was rather ineffective against ground targets, especially amored vehicles. It was generally acknowledged that large caliber camons would be needed in order to successfully engage motorized divisions.

A good example of insufficient free power of Soviet figures took place during battle of Oudanidanidan in March of 1937, when the Nationals attacked the farmar river in an attempt to encircle the capital of Madrid. The ineffective standing attacks flown by I-153 against the Italian motorized divisions brought home the lesion for the Soviet advisors that have caliber customers were needed on the battlefield. At this time the Soviet Union lacked of a ground taxist fighter in the union's intern.

The idea of turning the I-16 with large caliber guns was not an entirely new project. Earlier, the Polikarpov Design Bureau had gathered a good deal of experience with their common and I-16P and XRS-12Pilers. On both these prototypes the 20m SWM's cannons had been installed in the wings. Both of these prototype installations of the SNVAK, however, were never developed beyond the testing stage.

The I-16 Type 17 had the using mounted ShKAS 7.62Man guns replaced by the two ShvAK 202km camons, while the testing synchronized 7.62Man machine guns were retrained. The ammunition supply for the two ShvAK cameras was 150 rounds per weapon, consisting of either armpering or regueceivable rounds, or a mixture of both.

I-16 Type 17s can be easily identified from the earlier I-16 Type 10 by the long bursts of the 20m SWM's CAMon. Part of the gas pressure cylinder was also visible under the barrel. The 20m common became available during 1936 and had a rate of time of 750 to 800 rounds per minute.

A number of internal changes were also introduced on the I-16 Type 17, due to its increased gross weight. The I-16 Type 17 had a gross weight of 3.900 pounds (1.810 kg), while the car-ter Type 10 had a gross weight of 3.805 pounds (1.726 kg). Even with the additional weight **A 84 equipped pre-production 16-16 Type 17 undergoes amament testing as part of the State Acceptance trails.

of two cannons, the top speed of the 1-16 Type 17 was only slightly reduced. The Type 17 had a top speed of 264 mph (425 km) control by 278 mph (448 km) for the Type 10. The rate of climb, however, was greatly reduced. The Type 17 had a rate of climb of 1.843 feet per minute, while the Type 10 had a rate of climb of 2.430 feet per minute.

Most 1-16 Type 17 was assigned to ground attack duties and had the propeller spinter deleted, although this was not a standard feature.

The first 1-R Type 17 left the assembly in its Gazz-21 and Gazz-153 during 1938. Due to the fact that only a limited number of the new SNAW QARO antennas were available for the I-6 Type 17 and later 1-16 Type 27, only 1,184 aircraft of both versions of the common armed fighter were built through the Spring of 1940.

When the first 1-16 Type 17s reached Red Air Force registments during late 1938, they were pushed into combat against the Japanese during the Nonchand Incident. This uncluded war, which began on 11 May 1939, along the ill-defined Manhattan-Mongolian border lasted four months.

1-16 Type 17s were never expected, and when the Germans invaded Russian on 22 June 1941, the 1-16 Type 17s performed well in the ground support role against advancing troogo concentrations and armed vehicles. The 1-16 Type 17 saw action on the main battle fronts, until the I-2 became available in quantity. After that, it was deployed to minor heaters of operations, such as the Baltic and the Black Sea district.

## Appendix A The 1-16 Type 18

The 1-16 Type 18, was a direct result of a request from the front line units for a more powerful engine. As a result of the research work carried out by Arkadji D. Shvetsov and his team at the GAZ-19 retro-engine factory at Perm, a new, more powerful engine, the Shvetsov M-62, was ready for operational testing in 1937. The main difference was that the M-62 offered better high altitude performance than the M-25.

The M-62 was basically a Soviet copy of the American Wright-Cyclone R-1820-G-5 air cooled, radial engine. While the cubic inch capacity of the engine remained unchanged from the M-25V, the M-62 had a two-speed superbeter in place of the single-speed supercharger used with the M-25V. As a result, the M-62 now had a rating of 1,000 bp, compared with 775 bp for the M-25V. While the M-25V used 87 octuneft, the M-62 had to be serviced with 92 octuneft. One drawback was that the installation of the M-62 port plant resulted in a considerably increase of weight, with the engine being some 103 pounds (46 kg) heavier than the M-25V.

During early 1939, an M-62 was installed in a 1-16 Type 18 and factory trials with the new engine began at Zhukovsky. The M-62 powered 1-16 Type 18 differed from the 1-16 Type 10 in having an additional cooling air intake on top of the engine cowling. In addition, there were two exhaust stacks in the lower exhaust port position, in place of the single stub on the 1-16 Type 10.

M-62 powered aircraft also were fitted into the a variable-pitch AV-1 propeller. Externally the AV-1 propeller could distinguished from the earlier propellers by the two round balance weighs on the propeller hub and the wide chord propeller blades. The propeller spinner was able enlarged to accommodate the AV-1 propeller.

Thanks to the more powerful M-62 engine and variable pitch propeller, the I-16 Type 18 had a considerable increase in performance, especially at high altitudes. While the I-16 Type 10 had at top speed of 278 mph at 10.367 feet (448 km hr at 3,160 meter) the 1-16 Type 18 had a speed of 288 mph at 14,235 feet (464 km hr at 4,400 meter). In addition, the service ceiling was raised from 27,099 feet (8,260 meter) to 31,069 feet (9,470 meter).

Apart from the new engine and the AV-1 propeller the first production batches of the I-16 Type 18 were very similar to the I-16 Type 10. As a result the only visual identification feature to tell a standard I-16 Type 10 from the I-16 Type 18 were the enlarged spinner and the upper air intake on the engine cowling.

Later production variants of the I-16 Type 18 had an additional cockpit entry door added to the starwood side of the fuselage. Early 1-16 Type 18 had a utilised adopted from the I-16 Type 10, while later I-16 Type 18 were equipped with a tailwheel.

The armament of the I-16 Type 18 was the same as the I-16 Type 10. Due to the greater fuel consumption of the M-62, range dropped from 326 miles (525 km) to 301 miles (485 km). As a result the 16 Type 18 was modified with provision to carry two 52.8 gallon (200 liter) slipper type auxiliary fuel tanks under the wings which increased the maximum attainable range to 1.683 miles (1,100 km).

The I-16 Type 18 was only regarded as an interim variant, intended to keep production going until the more advanced M-63 power plant became available for the I-16. As a result, a limited number of the I-16 Type 18 were actually built.

Shortly after the I-16 Type 18 production was firmly established at GAZ-21 and GAZ-153. the Poliaformov OKB developed a new, even more powerful version. This development was possible because of continued engine improvements being made at GAZ-19, the zero-engine factory at Perm. They had continued work on the M-62 and could now offer an uprated version, the Shvetsov M-63, for installation into the I-16.

The M-63 was rated at 1.100 by five atac off with only a twenty pound increase in weight over the 1,000 hp M-62. This engine was selected for installation into the I-16, resulting in the I-16 Type 24.

The I-16 Type 24 introduced a number of structural improvements to the fuselage and wings. The thickness of the wing mixing was increased along with additional ribbing. An inspection hust was installed on the rear stoward fesage. Apart from this hust, the I-16 Type 18 and I-16 Type 24 were externally nearly identical.

The State Acceptance Trials of the I-16 Type 24 started during the first half of 1940, and revealed that there was no considerable improvement in flying characteristics in comparison with the I-16 Type 18 and, in fact, maneuverability was slightly inferior. The increased weight due to the structural refinements of the wing and fuselage had off set the horizontal power offered by the M-63 power plant. The gross weight of the I-16 Type 24 had increased to 4,149 pounds (1,882). The top speed was only slightly higher than the I-16 Type 18, at 292 mph (470 km/h) at 15,748 feet (4,800 meters). The rate of climb of 2.828 feet per minute was slightly less than the I-16 Type 18 (3,154 feet per minute). The only real improvement the M-63 offered was in service ceiling, which increased 33,288 feet (31,069 for the I-16 Type 24. The increased leaf consumption of the M-63, however, led to a cost-optimal system).

1-16 Type 27

The 1-16 Type 27 replaced the common armed I-16 Type 17 on the production lines at GAZ-21 and GAZ-153. The 1-16 Type 27 was based on the 1-16 Type 18 airframe, with the M-62 power plant but using the ammement of the 1-16 Type 17.

Due to the greater fuel consumption of the M-62, the I-16 Type 27 had provision for carrying two 52.8 gallo (200 liter) slipper-type auxiliary fuel tanks.

Like the meter 1-16 Type 17, the I-16 Type 27 was ammed with two SVAX 20baths camps with 150 rounds each in the wing and a pair of synchronized SIKA 7.62dan guns with a supply of 600 rounds mounted on the upper front fuselage.

The first 1-16 Type 27s were delivered during the first half of 1939 and saw combat over Mongolia against the Japanese. Due to the shortage of SVAX commons for the I-16, only a limited number of I-16 Type 27s were built.

During the Great Pacific War, I-16 Type 27s saw combat in the assault and ground support roles. Due to the fact that many I-16 assault regiments operated from muddy and unprepared fields, most I-16 Type 27s had the main wheel covers removed.

## I-16 Type 29

The emphasis behind the development of the I-16 Type 29, was the fact that a new, more effective 12.78nd machine gun had become available and as a result, the Polkarpov Design Bureau was ordered to install the new Berezin UDS weapon in the 1-16 airframe. The new fighter, designated the I-16 Type 29, passed the State Acceptance Trill during 1940 and the type was ordered into production at GAZ-21 and GAZ-153.

The I-16 Type 29 was developed using the I-16 Type 27 as airframe and the main difference was the introduction of the new armmer. The Berezin U8 ban had a rate of fire 700 to 800 rounds per minute and a maze velocity of 2.755 feet per second, (840 meter per second). There were two versions of the basis 12.78nd weapon, the Berezin UDS (psychonuclear) and the Berezin UDR free firing weapon. Generally, there were three different types of ammonium, then used, the standard bulk projectile which is a Black-Follow head, tracers with a Violet-Red head, and incapacity properties with a Black-Food head.

The mounting of the new Berezin UDS gun in the lower nose under the cowling made it necessary to relocate the lower air intake scope to the astrowal side of the lower nose. While the air intake scope on the 1-16 Type 29 was Tshaped, the I-16 Type 29, and an enlarged squared of air intake to the starward side.

A number of 1-16 Type 29s were equipped on the production line with the RSI-3 radio. Aircraft with this installation could be identified by an antenna mast on the upper starband side of the engine cowling in front of the canopy.

Most I-16 Type 29s were used in the ground support role and the aircraft had provision for six R0-82 rocket rails, three under each wing. These rails were used to fire RS-82 air-ground unpalded rockets. While the standard rocket fit was six rails, a number of 1-16 Type 29s were outflowed with four rails.

A number of I-16 Type 29s were also fitted with a bomb rack allowed of the rocket rails. This bomb rack could carry bounds up to 2.02 pounds (100 kg). Both types included the general purpose FAB-50 or FAB-100 bochs, the AO-10, AO-20M or FAB-50M fragmentation bombs of Z-8A-50TGIncardly bombs. These bochs were generally paired Gray, with a variety of different color codes on nose to located purpose. Antour bombs Ned Yellow-Red stripes, while fragmentation bombs were had Green and Blue stripes. The I-16 could also **A pre-production I-16 Type 29 during the _the aircraft's State Acceptance Trials.

carry bonds containing chemical agents, such as the CADA-25, the AOK-15. The chemical agent was loaded into ordinary transportation bonds shortly before a mission. Bonds containing chemical agents were marked with a Yellow Blue band. There were two major types of chemical agents used against the advinsing Wetherland, unnatural gas and photogene gas.

This aircraft was configured with a camera under the starboard wingtip, which caused the Red star to be off set further out on the underside of the wing. (Masterd Grieth)mph (828 km/h) at six level and 266 mph (429 km/h) at altitude. Compared to the contemporary Messerschmitt Br-109F-1, the I-16 Type 29 was totally inferior in all aspects, except maneuverability in close turn combats.

The development of the I-16 was determined mainly by the appearance of new engine, the process of development of the I-16 from the initial Type 5 to the ultimate Type 29, top speed was slightly improved, while the rate of climb became better due to the M-62 and M-63 engines and variable A-V-1 together. This was of set by a loss in horizontal maneuverability, which gradually got worse because of the weight increases. The main reason that top speed never increased dramatically was the various engines offered only relatively small increases in power. Throughout its production life, the I-16 power was increased by some twelve percent, while the power of the German Messerschmitt Br-109 had increased by sixty-seven percent. Though the M-62 and M-63 engines were of the best in the family of single row radial at cooled engines, there was no further prospect of increasing their power.

## Romanian I-16 Type 29

Shortly after start of the Second World War (Great Patriotic War) a Soviet pilot defected with his I-16 Type 29 to Romania, and landed in a field near the town of Dorchch in Modavia on 8 July 1941.

This aircraft was captured by the _Feruel Acineine Repeale Ale Romantici_ (Royal Rumanian Air Force) and an order was used to the ground crews of the _Escherichia 19 Observateur_ (19th) Reconnance Squaredowns based at Botsosian to dismantle the fighter at Dorchoid and to transport the I-16 Type 29 to Botsosian.

When the aircraft was being reassembled it was found that the starboard rear flaring for the fuselage mounted machine gun was missing. As a result the subsequent flight tests were flown without the firing. The I-16 Type 29 was reparted with a large Yellow identification band and Yellow wing tips, they prefer calm all Axis aircraft on the Eastern front. Initially only a blue-Yellow-Redf in flash was carried, but later the aircraft carried full national markings and the number, White 1, on the tail. The tactical number, White 1, was reserved as a serial number for the captured aircraft. Later, a captured Mir6-3 fighter, received the number, White 2, also painted on the tail.

After re-assembling the I-16 at Botsosian; the aircraft was assigned to Captain Ciocanek Popescu for the first flight. After the landing, Captain Popescu praised the extraordinary maneuverability of the I-16.

For the men of the 19th Reconnance Squaredown the I-16 was of particular interest, since they had had a number of occurrences between Soviet I-16s and their IAR-39s. Since it was fairly certain that there would be more in the future, Captain Popescu planned to use the control I-16 in mock control, training against IAR-39s. We crawish, a radio was installed the I-16 and several IAR-39 events were trained in possible countermeasures for use again the Soviet fighter during the Summer 1941. This training proved to be very effective. Between 220 men and 13 July 1941, three I-16s show down IAR-39s for a loss of two IAR-39.

In early September of 1941, the Romanian High Command decided to transfer the I-16 to _Grand Vinetance_ (Fighter Group) equipped with IAR-80s for additional air combat training. On 11 September 1941, Ist Lieutenant municipal arrived at Botsosian, to ferry the Soviet fighter to Buzana. No problems was encountered during the take of and Terry flight, but on landing at lasi airfield, the I-16 Type 29 suffered a landing gear failure and was seriously damaged. As a result, the type was scrapped at lasi and never reached the Fighter Units for air combat training.

The aircraft was used to fly mock combat against the squadron's IAR-39s, training the crews in ways to combat the I-16. (Dan Antonio)**

## Two Seat Trainers

### UTI-2 Trainer

In July of 1935, the I-16 Type 4 fighter was assigned to front-line Fisher Aviation Regiments. Simultaneously, it was decided to develop a two seat trainer version of the I-16 to assist pilots in conversion from earlier bignhers to the new monophac. The flight characteristics of the I-16 were demanding and it soon became obvious that noise pilots needed at least a couple of familiarization flights in a training version. When young pilots transitioned from the Polikarpov U-2 bignare directly to the hot monophac I-16 the attrition rate, especially during take offs and langlys was quite high.

During 1936, the first series of UTI-2 (UTI-_Chebloen Fienrovoachy Istebileit_Fighter Trainer) trainers were produced. The UTI-16 was based on the I-16 Type 4 with a second rear cockpit for the instructor and dual controls. The aircraft was unmanned and was powered by an 480 h/2 power plant. UTI-2s were produced in very limited numbers, mainly due to the fact that the more powerful M-25 engine had become available.

The introduction of the I-16 had revealed that the Polikarpov U-2 was no longer suited for basic training, since many novice pilots had great difficulty in mastering the I-16 after receiving their initial training in the Polikarpov bignhers. As a result, a two seat now using training monophac, the Yakubov UTI-2, was chosen as the primary trainer and the UT-1 single seat aerobatic trainer, which had flight characteristics close to the I-16, for advanced training. Then fighter lights would receive their conversion training in the UTI-2 and later UTI-4, before finally progressing to the single seat I-16 fighter.

### UTI-4 Trainer

During 1937, the first UTI-4 two seat trainers were delivered to the Fighter Aviation Regiments. Once UTI-4 production was launched, an order was issued by the Ministry of Aviation Production, that every fourth airframe on the I-16 production line should be completed.

ed as a trainer. The UTI-4 differed from the earlier UTI-2, in that it was based on the I-16 Type 5 airframe with a M-25 power plant.

The UTI-4, like the earlier UTI-2, carried no armament in order to save weight due to the introduction of the second cockpit. Normally, the instructor would occupy the rear cockpit, while the student usually occupied the front cockpit. The standard cockpit was moved to the rear some seventeen inches (45 cm) and the fuel tank was reconutured and reduced in size to enable the second cockpit to be installed in the fuselage.

The cockpit carry door was deleted on the UTI-4. While the fighter had a straight cockpit, A new, flatter single piece windscreen was installed in front of the front cockpit and second, smaller tunnel shaped windshield was installed between the front and the rear cockpit.

Early UTI-4s were all fitted with the M-25 power plant, but when the M-25 became available, it was also installed in the UTI-4. A number of early UTI-4s also lacked a propeller spinner, however, this was not an identification feature, since a number of early UTI-4s did carry a spinner.

Early UTI-4s had a 'tunnel' shaped rear windowscreen but, in order to improve the view out the front from the rear cockpit, the padded head rest in the front cockpit was lowered and a flatter,solved frameless unshielded was fitted on later production versions.

The two seat fighter-trainer was progressively developed along side the fighter series. The only exception was that the UT1-4 retained the large wing flaps, which were standard to the early fighter versions I-16 Type 5 and I-16 Type 6, throughout is production life. As production proceeded, most of the improvements introduced on the figures were also automatically introduced on the trainer, such as improved instrumentation and cable cutter for the main undercorazies.

When the I-16 Type 10 became available with its M-25V power plant, this same engine was also fitted to the UT1-4, The first UT1-4 with the new engine left the production line at G/AZ-21 and G/AZ-213 using 1938. Thus the M-25V powered trainers had also a T-shaped air intake on the lower engine cost 10]. While the early UT1-4 had a single exhaust stack in the lower exhaust port, M-25V powered UT1-4 had two exhaust stacks in the lower power. Most of the standard production UT1-4s powered by the M-25V engine were equipped with an 1-16 Type 5 Doppler spinner.

A number of UT1-4s were fitted with a fixed undecerarriage and, as a result, no landing gear start and wheel covers were installed.

Late production UT1-4s had the tailoidal replaced by a tailwheel. Due to shortage of trainer versions of modern fighters, such as the Yak-1 and the LAGG-3, the UT1-4 also served as a transition trainer for young pilots instead of by these fighters. In the early stage of the Great Particle W, the UT1-4s also served in the reconnaissance mode over the front. A number of UT1-4s were also assigned to Fisher Aviation Registers at the front for lision ducts. Even in 1944, when I-16 had been withdrawn from active duty, the UT1-4s collected on.

A number of UT1-4s were converted with fixed sliding range. As a result the main wheel covers were detected and cables were attached to front and rear of the skis to keep them from moving in flight. A small sky was also attached to the tailoidal.

The UT1-4 also saw service as a blind flying trainer. Initially a fabric, folding tent was installed in the rear capit which was closed just before take off. Other UT1-4s converted for this duty were fitted with an earlier slidingwood bond. Some UT1-4s were also equipped with a tailwheel replacing the tailoidal. UT1-4s serving in the blind flying training tape were still in one during 1943.

Between 1937 and -1939, a total of 1639 UT1-2 and UT1-4s were built at G/AZ-

**This UT1-4 was used as a blind flying trainer during 1943. The rear canopy is covered by a rear sliding pivoved hood. The ruder trim tab is a non-standard fitting. (G, F, Petrov)**During 1938, a limited number of UTI-4s were delivered to China to serve in the advanced training fee for pilots converting from the Yakovlev UT-1 to the single seat I-16. These UTI-4s were all the production models with a disturbed and powered by a M-25V engine. The UT-14-s were all allocated to the Air Force Academy at Kunning. Later, in the Summer 1939, when a Russian-style Instruction School was established at 1-ming, most of the UTI-4s were transferred to this location, along with Yakovlev UT-1s.

Beside supplying a large variety of aircraft, the Soviet Union also supported China in establishing an aviation industry. As early as in 1924, the Chinese Commissent Party, in cooperation with the Knowledge Industry be D. Sun Yatsen and supported by the Soviet government, set up the Hungary Military Academy and a military aircraft school. A number of students were sent to the Soviet Union for instruction.

During 1940, the Second Aircraft Manufacturing Factory of the Chinese Air Force at Nanchum, Sichuan Province, started license production of the UT-14 under the designation long-28A. The Chinese copy of the UT-14 was identical to the late production versions of the original Soviet trainer.
