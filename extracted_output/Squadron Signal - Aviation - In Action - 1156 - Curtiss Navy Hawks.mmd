## Introduction

The Curtis Aerolome & Motor Company was the largest aircraft manufacturer in the U.S. during the First World War, but its principal products were low-powered training aircraft and slow twin-engend flying boats. The firm had designed and built a few unmanned and unsuccessful single seat scouts, but had produced nothing that could be called a high-performance aircraft.

Curtis' first experience with up-to-date high-performance types began late in 1917 when it received large government contracts to build established French and British aircraft. A contract to build 2,000 low-seat British Bristol F.2B figures ended disfavors and early twenty-six were built. The government had insisted that the 250 h British Rolls-Royez "eagle" engine be replaced with the new 400 hp American "Library" engine. The Bristol was not adaptable to such a mixer change, and the contract was cancelled after several fall accidents. The contract for 3,000 French Spark III filters was cancelled before a single aircraft had been built, and only one aircraft on an order for 1,000 hp British S.E.S. engines was actually derived.

Curtis design' experience with high-performance aircraft began early in 1918, after the government abandoned its policy of having U.S. industry build foreign designs and permitted the development of purely domestic combat models. The first developed by Curtis was the Model 18-T original designation, Model 15 under the 935 system" Wagner's Ultimate. This was a two-seat fighter powered by the revolutionary 400 hp Curtis-Kirkham K.2 engine and was briefly the world's fastest aircraft, with a top speed at full military that 163 mph.

The end of the war end developed the two Way prototypes, but because of their speed, the Navy end them as racers in 1923. Curtis: however, went on to win production orders for aircraft designed by other firms under the end government processes policies of the time. If the Army or Navy bought a prototype aircraft from a designer/builder, it also acquired the rights to the design. If production models were wanted, the requesting service would invite bids from the entire industry. Often, some time offer than the aircraft designer won the production order.

Under this procedure, Curtis built fifty 300 hp Derrace Dighters and fifty Martin MB-2/NBS-1 bombers, but none of these traditional designs did anything to advance the technology base at Curtis.

Curtis also took part in another government program. The Army Air Service Engineering Division had designed a new aircraft, the PN-1 (Pursuit, Night) and invited bids from the **The first fighting Curtis built for the Navy were third-four TS-16, designed by the Navy Bureau of Aeronautics. The aircraft were used aboard the US LANGLF (CV-1). (USH) industry for the building of two prototypes. Curtis won the contract, but it was such an unsatisfactory aircraft that only one of the two was completed and it was not flown. Curtis got one very significant technological benefit from it; however, an introduction into welded steel tube fuselose construction techniques.**

Curtis did some highly original work in developing magma aircraft that used later versions of the K-12 engine, first as the CD-21 had as they plain D-12. These mers were used the semi-monocroscope laminated wooden fuselose construction of the "Wasp" and set several world speeds, as well as winning major races from 1921 through 1925. In some Way movement paper there are several observers in seven experimental flights since Congress might consider raising credit to be unnecessary fixabilities in the 1920-1924 period of postwar unsureity.

Curtis' first production order for a Navy fighter came in 1922 when it was low bidder for a contract to build thirty-four TS-1 shipped fielser designed by the Navy's Bureau of Aeronautics (Baker). Navy serial numbers (called Bureau Number [BuN] because they were assigned by the Bureau of Aeronautics) were A-6248/6270 and A-6305/6315. As a check on production time and cost, the Naval Aircraft Factory in Philadelphia built five exhausts A.gain, the low-powered (200 hp) design did nothing to advance Curtis technology, but Curtis won a 1924 Navy control to redesign the wood-frame TS-1 into an all-ent aircraft. The two built (BuNos A-6689, 6600) were designated as FAC-1s in next recognition of the fact that the three preceding race modelers had the Navy had been spun F.-for-Fighter designations. The designation FAC-1ttranses as F. (gift, 4th fighter by C Curtiss. (1 initial configuration))

The next Curtis Navy fighter, was a duplicate of the contemporary U.S. Army P-1 Hawk fighter, built under the designation FCC-1. The logical FSC designation was skipped deliberately because there are 2sharp number of wartime F-S.Ifing bouts still in service and it was thought that two F-5 models in service simultaneously would be confusing. Despite the claims of a well-known aviation artist/historian, there was no Navy equivalent of the Army Curtis PW-8 designated the FSC.

### Navy Curtiss Hawks

Starting with the FCC-1 Hawk in 1925, Curtis single-seat figures for the Navy continued "through 1934 with the FTC-1 Schwank, the PGC Spurrowhawk, and the F11CBFR Goshwick. It should be pointed out; however, that none of these names were official. Curtis had given hot names to most of its aircraft models since 1919. Even though the armed forces did not use names for their actual, Curtis applied them to its military models in advertising and other publicity. The name, "Hawk" was pushed very hard and figured heavily in Curtis' considerable export sales of those designs.

### Aircraft Costs

The unit cost of military aircraft varies greatly depending on the circumstances of the sale. A single prototype costs much more than a quantity production model since much of the builder's development cost is charged to that one unit. In production quantities, unit costs are greatly reduced because development costs have usually been written of against the prototype, hard cooling costs for the production models can be ameliorated over many units, and raw materials and equipment costs per unit are greatly reduced through a volume purchase.

For military aircraft, the unit costs are the price paid to the builder for the completed airframe. Most of the equipment, power plant, arrangement, instruments, electronics, and sometimes even wheels and makes, were provided by the Army or Navy and were identified as Government Furnished Equipment, or GFE. The aircraft unit costs presented in this book are mostly those billed by Curtiss to the Navy as listed in Navy contract figures, and do not include GFE. In some cases, especially with company-owned prototypes, the Navy bought the entire aircraft, power plant and all, and also paid the development costs.

## Characteristics And Performance

Except where otherwise noted, the figures for Navy Curtiss Hawk characteristics and performance have been taken from official contemporary Navy documents - "Characteristics and Performance- US. Navy Aircraft". The figures do not always agree with corresponding figures released by Curtiss, especially in the areas of aircraft weight and performance. In the 1920s the Navy noted that the difference between "East Coast" and "West Coast" aviation gasoline had a notable effect on aircraft performance. For comparison between several identities, the U.S. Army and Navy "Hawk", it should be noted that the Army rated the Curtiss D-12C engine at 435 h at 2.300 rpm while the Navy rated the engine at 400 h at 2.200 rpm.

It should also be noted that as aircraft designs advanced, acquiring more weight, power and supplementary complexity, it took longer to test and approptropology. It also took longer to get the inevitable "new" regime bugs" out of production models in service. One, the last of the Navy Curtiss Hawk biplanes, was never successfully debugged and was withdrawn from service within a year because of these problems.

## Power Plant Designations

Until the late 1920s, the engines used in American military aircraft were identified by the manufacturer's designations - Curtiss D-12, Pratt & Whitney R-1340, Wright I-5, etc. Progressive variants of these engines were identified by letter - D-12C, R-1340B, etc. On 1 February 1928, in a rare bit of inter-service experiment, the U.S. Army and Navy agreed to standardize aircraft engine designations.

Engines were then identified as to type by a letter - V for Yee, R for Radial, etc., followed

**During 1924, Curtiss designed the TS-1 as the F4C-1.** The main differences were an initial structure and raising the lower wing to the underside of the fusegue. The _heart retrained the 200 hp Lawrence & J-J air-cooled radial engine used on the TS-1. (Curriss, T-2722)_

## Boeing - Curtiss Competition

Curriss and Boeing appeared to be neck-and-neck competitors for U.S. Army and Navy fighter business. From 1925 through 1933, they supplied almost all of the single-sent figures to both services.

Actually, the competition was not a true win-or-lose affir. It was the policy of both services to rely on two sources for several types of aircraft, so it was not a case of choosing one design over another. This book will show that when the Navy placed a production order with crisis, it also placed another of nearly similar size for a corresponding Boeing model. After the F7C-1 Seahiw of 1928, however, Curtiss hold no more single-sent figures to the Navy in squadron strength until 1932. Boeing homogenized the Navy single-sent fighter market with its F4B series until Curtiss re-enired the field with the F11C Goshawk.

The competition was for a very small market by present-day standards. In 1926, the Navy and Marine Corps had only two regular fighter squadars each. By 1933, these had grown to six for the Navy and free for the Mariews. In 1937, the last year of full-squation use of Navy Hawks, the Navy had five designated fighter squadars and three single-sent bomber squadars, two using Boeing F4B-4s and one using Curtiss BFC-2s. The Mariews were down to two fighter squadars.

Reading squadron numbers from aircraft photos gives the impression of more, but such is not the case. Squadron redesignations resulted in new numbers for the same organizations and some Navy fighter squadars were redesignated as bomber squadars while still using the same F-designated aircraft as bombers.

to 2,125 pounds and the gross weight increased to 2,868 pounds. The aircraft's performance suffered accordingly; the top speed dropped to 150 mph but the service ceiling, according to Navy figures, increased to 22,700 feet. Range at cruising speed fell to 362 miles. Three of the FCC-2s, delivered in November of 1925, were assigned, along with three FCC-2s.

## Appendix F6c-3

Experience are gained with the two upgraded FGC-2s resulted in an order for thirty-five carrier-based FGC-3s (BuNoA-71287/162, Curtis Model 34%), which were generally the equivalent of the Army P-1A Hawk (Model 34%). This time the Army Hawk followed the Navy's lead. Navy-initiated refinements to the FGC-3 were incorporated into the P-1A, which had a fuselage three inches longer than previous Hawks and used the improved D-12C engine. Again, weight increased and performance suffered.

The FGC-3 reflected the Navy's coherent for heavier armchair for its lightness. Like earlier Army Hawks, FGC-3s were given the provision for replacing the starchard 3.03c either machine gun with a Browning 50 culler gun as an alternate installation. This optional armchair installation was to remain standard to the end of Navy bignle fighter production. The FGC-3 could also carry bombs on a rack installed on the undertheories fuel tank fittings.

The FGC-3s used as shipboard fighters were initially fitted with FGC-2 landing gear and tail skids, but these were replaced in service by a later type used on the production FGC-4. FGC-3 assigned to land-based Marine Corps squadron were fitted with FGC-1 style landing gear. During their service careers, FGC-3s underwent a number of tail skid changes and provision was made for the installation of twin flouts in place of the wheel landing gear. This configuration was flight tested on FGC-1s and FGC-2s, and one Navy squadron, PB-1B (formerly VF-5) operated briefly on flouts during 1928.

Equivalent Boeing models were twenty-seven FB-5s (BuNoA-7101/7127) that were major Fuseal.

Delivery of FCC-3s began in October of 1926, with unit costs of $12.938. By this time the Navy was paying 59,500 for Curtis D-12 engines. Eighteen FCC-3s were delivered to. In July of 1928, VF-5 was redesignated as a bomber squadron,VB-1B and attached to the Battle Force. The squadron remained home based on the LENMON, but operated for a brief period on hosts. The for Executing marking on the nose was for bombing. Even though it was on flats, Bulbo A-7144 retained ten tall said. The tail color was yellow. The aircraft carried to Black leader strips, even though aircraft was the leader of the fourth section. (USB)

## Appendix F F6C-3 Racers

Both land and seaplane variants of the F6C-3 were used by the Navy and Marines for closed-course racing from 1926 to 1930. Some were stock aircraft, while others were extensively modified.

The first F6C-3 racer from 803A-7128 was used as a reverse aircraft for the Navy's 1926 Schneider CPo Trophy Rating Team. Since the United States had won the 1925 event, the 1926 race was held in the United States at Norfolk, Virginia, on 13 November. The F6C-3 flew because the Navy's other per pacing aircraft had been eliminated.

The D12A engine was modified to produce up to 507 by and the under hostcase fuel tanks was enlarged to allow the aircraft to carry enough fuel to cover the 23 miles closed course at fall throttle. The F6C-3 placed fourth to higher powered pure racing designs at a speed \({}^{\circ}\)13659 mph.

## Appendix G Curtis Marine Trophy

The Curtis Marine Trophy Race was established in 193 by Glenn Curtis as an annual closed-course race for U.S. Navy seaplanes. Since this was usually run as a single isolated event recommended to the other major race meets, it received little attention from the public and is virtually unknown, even to present-day air race histories.

F6C-3s participated from 1926 through the final running in 1930. They won in 1928 and 1930, with speeds of 157.6 and 164.08 mph, respectively. It is a sad commentary that in spite of all the great advances in aircraft design during the late 1920s, the fastest seaplane in the Navy, in 1930, was the 1926 production model of a 1924 design.

serve until 1932.

In 1930, some Marine FCC-4s were fitted with Townsend anti-drag rings around their Part & Whitney Wasp engines. These were relatively cheap and light adaptations of the full NACA cowling made famous by the 1929 races and added a few mph to the aircraft's speed without the first FCC-4 of the production order (BuRo A-7393) was delivered in March of 1927, with a new style of carrier landing gear. Used for test work, Bulko A-7393 was later redesignated as the XFEC-4 and served briefly with Marine Fighter Squadron VF-4M.

The manufacturer's name was no longer carried on the ruder. (USR)

### F6c-4 Variants

The prototype and several production FFC-4s were used as testbeds for a number of power plant experiments, some of which resulted in changes in the aircraft's designation.

### F6c-5

After the first FFC-4 (Bulko A-6968) became the prototype FFC-4 powered by a R-1340 Wap engine, it was later used as a test bed for another Part & Whitney radial engine, the slightly larger 25-D R-160Hot. With this power plant, the ascertainrs redesignateds the FFC-5 (later MPC3 after the Navy adopted the X-for-Experimental prefix in 1972). No production order was forthcoming and no FFC Hawk, nor any other Army or Navy fighter ever used the "Home" engine.

### F6c-4 (Wright-Powered)

One Production FFC-4 (BuNo A-7403) was loaned to the Wright Aeronautical Corporation in 1929 for use as a test bed for the new 300 hp Wright R-975 (J-6-9). Whitford engine. In spite of the engine change, the aircraft's designation was not changed, even though this was standard practice. The purpose of the program was to test the new engine in a suitable airframe, not to upgrade the now obsolescent Hawk.

In using the R-975, this FGC-4 matched the two U.S. Army XP-21 Hawks that had been redesignized from the two XP-3s (serials 25-300 and 28-189) to test the very similar 300 hp Patt & Whitney R-958 Twin Wang Jr. engine. This FGC-4 (BuNo A-7403) later became the XFC-7 prototype.

### Xf6c-7

Another experimental engine installationswas made to a FGC-4 (BuNo A-7403) resulting in it being redesignated as the XFC6-7. The engine was the new 350 hp inverted Ranger SGV-70, an air-cooled V-12. The letters S and G in the engine designation stood for supercharged and geared. Ranger hoped to get high power from an relatively small displacement by running the engine at a higher speed than contemporary engines; i.e., 2,400 pm compared to 2,000 rpm for the 300 hp Pkw R-958 Wap Jr. Since such a good asymers unfortunately for the propeller, the engine was geared about an ratio of 1.321. Because of the spur gear, which had been added to an engine that had been originally been designed for direct drive, the propeller turned red-hand wall was opposing of standard American practice.

The engine changes were made at the Naval Aircraft Factory in 1932. Since the aircraft was to serve only as a test bed for the engine, no performance figures were recorded and the original FGC-4 designation, pointed on the aircraft's harder, were not even changed. With the V-770 installed, the XFC-7s resembled the U.S Army XP-17 (the first P-14 Hawks [serial 25-410]) which was modified to test the larger but otherwise similar 480 hp Wright V-460 engine.

The XFC-7 was reconverted to FGC-4 standards after finishing the test program and returned to nominal operations.

The V-770 was not a satisfactory engine at the time, and in fact, it was never truly successful. Improvements by Ranger encouraged the Navy to order it for the prototype Curtis S03C-1 Seguliuli May of 1938. By that time the engine was delivering 450 hp at 3,000 rpm (520 for uikecr at 3,150 rpm). The Navy ordered large numbers of Segulias, but a combination of aircraft and power plant problems led to their being withdrawn from fleet service after a short period.

This FGC-4 (BuNo A-7403) was loaned to the Wright Aeronautical Corporation as a test bed for the new Wright R-975 Whitbratt radial engine. It was fitted with a longer nose section, needed to balance the lighter engine. The new nose was rated in with sheet metal that covered the lower ends of the center section struts. (P.H. Dean)F7C Seahawk

In December of 1927 the Navy initiated a fly-off design competition for new Pratt & Whitney Ways powered float fighter. Both the F6C-1 and F6C-2 had been tested as sealings and had proven that the Hawk could operate on Hosts. While the F6C-3 was yet to operate as a float fighter in squadron strength, it took would find operational use as a float fighter. The new design was to be capable of operations both as hard based and as single-float sealings. It was intended that it would replace the Vought F6N-1 separate caught fighters that were stationed aboard battleships. Three manufacturers, Boeing, Curtiss and Eberhard, responded and entered company owned prototypes.

## 11 Xf7c-1

The new Curtis (Model 43) prototype had nothing in common with the F6C series except the required Part A Whitney Waysai-cooked radial engine as used in the F6C-4. The line-base used riveted steel and aluminium tubing, similar to the contemporary Curtiss Falcon two-seater instead of welded steel, and the upper wing was swept back outward of a straight center section, also similar to the Fabiano. The cloud was constant over the full span and the air-foil section was the Curtiss C-72. A commonly held belief, thanks to a widely-distributed early Curtiss public photo that showed the upper wing leading edge-on, was that the upper wing was originally straight, not swept. This is not so, the outward wing panels were swept

The prototype Seahawk, known as the **"Curties Navy Fighter,"** on the ramp at the Curtiss factory on 28 February 1927. The aircraft had shock absorbers built into the wheels of the rigid-truss landing gear. **(Curties T-3230)**

**The prototype Seanhwa was modified to production standard and was redesignated the XF7C-1. The external had long alerons on the upper wing extending in broad to the center selection, the aleron actuator start was located at mid-span, and the speeder barfores going into the same year had holes in it for carrier deck alignment books. (Curtis)**

From the start,

An unusual feature of the new prototype was the landing gear. Instead of rubber discs in compression as on the F6Cs and Army Hawks, the shock absorbers used on the prototype were spring units built into each wheel, similar to the type used on some of the early 1920s

Curtis scores. The landing gear starts formed a rigid divid-scale wheeled tube trust. This landing gear was used on the prototype only, and it had provision for a crossbar that supported the alignment books that were used to engage the longitudinal guide wires then in use on Navy carriers.

Curtis cannot the new fighter the Seanhwa. Although the prototype was company-owned, it was known that it would be officially designated F7C-1 if purchased by the Navy, so that designation was painted on the holder, along with other artificial tether that read. Curtis

The aberrator school yNighter." The first flight of the Seanhwa was on 28 February 1927.

The Eberhard was eliminated from the competition and both the Boeing and Curtis entries were sent back to their factories for improvements that included new wings of increased span and wing area. The Boeing prototype originally had tapered wings like the FB setise, but ended up with constant-chord wings, having the upper wing swept back similar to the Seanhwa wing.

The revised Curtis, now officially designated XF7C-1, won a production order for seven aircraft. When that contract was awarded, an 28 August 1927, the prototype was accept-ed as the first article on the contract and was assigned BaNo A-7653. As a single prototype, the cost was high-582,450 complete.

The XF7C-1 was used mainly for experimental work, and late in its career was fitted with an arrester hook for tests on the simulated carrier deck at Naval Air Station (NAS) Hampton Roads, Virginia. It was also located to the NACA for tests of the new NACA cowling. Moneted on floats, it won the 1929 Curtis Marine Trophy with a speed of 162.22 mph. It also served briefly with Marine Fisher Separators V5-Sand V7-F9M two separate assignments at Marine Corps Air Station (MCAS) Station, Virginia. It was damaged beyond repair at Quantico 15 May 1932, and was sufficient from the inventory with a total Navy flight time of 527 hours 6 minutes.

## F9C Sparrowhaw

The FPC Sparrowhaw (Curtis Model 58) was a Navy fighter that was unsuccessful at the mission for which it was designed, but achieved success in another field that gave it fame all out of proportion to its performance and numbers.

In 1928 and 1929 the Navy's Bureau of Aeronautics laid out several new designs - Models 92 through 96 - for a new series of smaller shipboard figures. All were bijmakers with the upper wing attached directly to the top of the fughese instead of being raised above the fuselage on crusts. Because of the later use of the Sparrowhawk, for anirab hook-on operations, it was widely believed that this design feature was added to the BuAir models with the pilot's forward and upward visibility, so essential to airab operations, in mind. In actually, this was not the case and this type of wing design was part of the original concept.

Two manufacturers built directly-competing Navy-funded prototypes to meet the BuAir Model for requirements, Curtis with the KAPC-1 and General (formerly Atlantic and Fokker) with the XFA-1 (A for Atlantic). Both were ordered in June of 1930, and had consecutive BuNos.

### XF9C-1

The XFPC-1 (ordered as BuNo A-8731 but delivered as BuNo 8731 because the Navy had dropped use of the A-prefix) was a big leap into the age of new construction technology for Curtis. It featured all-metal construction, with a semi-monocque aluminum fuselage. The

**The XFPC-1 in its original configuration with a carrier deck arrester hook but no airship hook-on equipment. The Yellow coloring on top of the non-adjustable horizontal stabilize extends to the top of the root filter. (Curtiss)**tail surfaces were metal covered, while the wings and altiferous were fabric covered. Because of the aircraft's small size and the closeness of the wings, a sub-structure was built below the fuselage as an anchoring point for the flying wires. It also doubled as an anchor for the inner parts of the triped landing gear.

Although the Navy had expressed preference for the new 400 hp Print & Whitney R.985 Wap 2 Air-cooled radial engine for the Model 96, Curtis remained loyal to its Curtis-Wright affiliation and fitted the aircraft with a Wright R.975C (0-6) 99 line-cylinder air cooled radial that delivered 400 hp at 2,300 rpm at sea level. The XYP5-I was the first Curtis aircraft to have a Towned ring designed into it instead of being added later as post-protodification.

The Wright 1-6 series engines had their exhaust ports on the forward side of the cylinders, and these fed into a collector ring at the front of the cernakac. For the initial engine installation on the XYP5-I and the production YYP5-2, the exhaust system was changed to individual exhaust stacks which were turned 180 degrees to discharge behind the cylinders. The cernakec of the XYP5-I was fitted with a large force plate having variable openings lowers for cernakec cooling. Later in is in career, the XYP5-I was re-engited with a 420 hp Print & 975E engine with a front collector ring and a single forward-pointing exhaust stack.

Since the exterior of the XYP5-I was mostly metal, it occurred to contemporary Navy painting standards in having all the metal surfaces painted in Lugy (almost an off-White color). Fabric areas were Silver, while the top of the upper wing and horizontal it still surfaces were Chemone Yellow.

The XYP5-I was built at Garoden City, where it made its first flight on 12 February 1931. Equiped for carrier operations, it was used by the Navy for that purpose, as was the opening XFA1-1. The Part & Whitney Way powered fighter- Joyce XYP4, which are directly competitive with the Curtis and General designs, had been rejected earlier. As it turned out, it has yavy quickly realized that the small carrier raised bigname further closed bigname that did't work.

The Sornowbrush was saved, however, when it was found that its small size tail for over the sunny's two new ray height, the USK ARON (ZRS-4) and the USK MACON (ZRS-5). The 2 hr inlet designations defined as being an airhip rather than an airplane, the R identified therein are rigid animals (not blumps), and is indicated that they were to serve as scouts. The dash number identified the sequence of the Navy's rigid inhibings.

These airships were designed to carry aircraft and four Sornowrabacks could fit into the hanger bay in the help of the ship while a fifth could react on an external station called, "The Prech."

With this new mission in mind, the XYP5-I was sent to the Naval Aircraft Factory for the installation of a Navy-designed aerial hook-on gear that had been developed earlier on a Voyden (0-10 pliagure for hook-on tests with the older airship USS LOS AMegELS (ZR-3). The XYP5-I made its first hook-on USK LOS AMegELS 07 I October 1931.

The cost of the XYP5-I complete was $74,442. It was assigned as a spare aircraft to USK ARON, and then to USK MACON, all the while keeping its X-designation. At first, it retained its original 30 x 5.00 high-pressure wheels without well parts, but was later modified to use the smaller, low-pressure wheels and open-sided wheel parts of the P5-2. As

After brief hook-on tests with USK MACON in the Summer of 1933, the XYP5-I was transferred to the Naval Aircraft Factory, where its hook was removed. It was then used for test and utility work. It was screened in January of 1935, with a total Navy flight time of only 213 hours.

XF9C-2

During Navy evaluations of the XFPC-1, Curtis built a second Sparrowhawsk prototype as a company-funded project (Model 58A). This was unofficially called the XFPC-2 and carried the civil registration X986W4. It was started at the Garden City plant, but since Curtis-Wright was closing that plant as a depression economy, the project was moved to the new Kenmore plant near the main Curtis plant in Buffalo. This had been built for Curtis engine production, but since all engine work was transferred to Wright following the Curtis-Wright merger of 1929, the building became available for aircraft production. All subsequent Curtis Hawk balances were built in the Kenmore plant.

The XFPC-2 differed from the XFPC-1 in a number of ways. To improve the pilot's visibility forward during such nose-high operations as landing, the upper wing was raised four inches to allow him to see under it. This resulted in a distinctive spill using configuration. The fuseling itself remained essentially the same as the XFPC-1, and the order, originally ball-maced as on the XFPC-1, was enlarged and had the balance area detected. The engine was a Civil Wright R.975E, installed two inches lower in the faelge to improve the pilot's forward visibility and make more room for the two.30 caliber machine guns.

The landing gear was a single-legging similar to the XFPC-6. Later, this was changed to a rigid single-leg type with wire hacing and the shock absorbers built into the wheel, and Although the Sparrowhawsk had been rejected as a carrier-based fighter aircraft, the XFPC-2 was fitted with an arrester hook since operations at sea with the airbows will likely require landings aboard a carrier.

As a privately owned airplane, the XFPC-2 prototype's coloring was not Navy standard. The fuselage, engine coral, landing gear and users were Command Blue or Admiral Blue which was used on aircraft assigned to Navy Flag Officers. The fabric was Silver except for the tops of the upper wing and horizontal tail, which were Chromue Yellow.

Based on tests of the XFPC-2, the Navy ordered six production PC-2s that incorporated many of the improvements of the prototype XFPC-2. Curtis made further changes to the

**The Curtis-owned XFPC-2 prototype retained the balanced XFPC-1 style rudder. It carried a civil registration (986A) and had a straight single-leg landing gear with smaller-diameter four-pressure wheels in fully enclosed wheel panels. (Curries W-689A)**

The XFPC-2 on the grass at NAS Anosostia while under going flight tests in November of 1981. The upper wing was some four inches higher position than the XFPC-1, the rader was changed to a larger unbalanced type rudder, a _X-portka_ was added to the civil registration number, and there were two blast tubes installed for the two machine guns under the top of the Townberg. (1980)

XFPC-2 as a result of Navy tests. The Navy finally bought the prototype in November of 1982, assigning it BuNo 9264. Brought up to production standards, including triped landing gear and a still larger vertical tail, the XFPC-2 became a square aircraft for both USES ARROW and US MASCON until the loss of US MASCON. Stripped of its hooks, it went to over as a utility aircraft until it was damaged in a forced landing in November of 1936. It was then broken up for spare spare robots to keep the surviving PC-2s operational.

For a prototype aircraft, it was cheap. The Navy paid Curtis only 529,253 for it and it ended its Navy career with a total flight time of 254 hours.

**Modified to production FPC-2 standards with a revised vertical tail and new landing gear, the XFPC-2 under went a number of hook-on tests with US MASCON, including this test on 7 July 1933. As the spare Sparrowhaw for USES ARROW, it did not carry until markings. (USBN)**

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:32]

became systematic. The aircraft flew out on headings 60 degrees from the airship's course. After flying for a specified time or distance, they turned inward 120 degrees on a course that would intercept the airship.

For some of these search missions, the Spurrowhawks did not take off independently of the airship as they usually did to make it "light" for taverhoff. They were taken allot with it, and then mechnix aboard the airship removed their landing gear, while in flight. Range was extended by installing a third gallon streamlined bully tank. Of course, the wheel-less aircraft had to return to the airship for recovery. Normally, they were kept aboard when the airship landed to add weight and reduce the need to valve expensive helium gas during the landing.

The Spurrowhawks were not part of a regular Navy squadron; they were neutralifiers of the airship. Each of the six P\(\mathrm{C}\mathrm{2}\mathrm{s}\) had the status and markings of a section leader in a normal eighteen aircraft Navy squadron. The two X-models were swaps and did not carry until marks. When attached to USAR, the P\(\mathrm{C}\mathrm{2}\mathrm{s}\) mirrorted vertical air stripes. These deviated from Navy standard in that the forward (Blue) stripe was on the vertical fan rather than on the radar. Shortly after transfer to USARON, the stripes were eliminated in favor of a unit color, all-black tail surfaces.

The Spurrowhawks did not qualify for landings aboard aircraft carriers and December of 1933, who are a problem arose. The smaller wheels of the P\(\mathrm{C}\mathrm{2}\mathrm{s}\) had their buns even with the cross-deck arcing wires. If a were to be deflected significantly, or even go flat, the wire would be above the wheel and its fading would snap the struts. The Navy recommended that the P\(\mathrm{C}\mathrm{2}\mathrm{s}\) be fitted with the old 30 x 5.00 high-pressure wheels would not cover the wires, but the Spurrowhawks plots one up with a quick and easy for. Small fit-like projections were built onto the fronts of wheel up to deflect cross wires under the wheels when necessary.

When US MACON crushed into the Pacific on 12 February 1933, four Spurrowhawks (BuNos 905859061), event down with her, The XP\(\mathrm{C}\mathrm{2}\mathrm{C}\mathrm{2}\)- and the two surviving P\(\mathrm{C}\mathrm{2}\mathrm{s}\) (BuNos 9056, 9057) were then stripped their bucks, redesignated as XP\(\mathrm{C}\mathrm{2}\mathrm{C}\mathrm{2}\)- and assigned to limited utility prices. The last P\(\mathrm{C}\mathrm{2}\mathrm{s}\) (BuNos 9058) were an 0.045 library with a total of 676.3 Navy flight hours. It was later rebuilt with parts of the second prototype, the original XP\(\mathrm{C}\mathrm{2}\) (BuNos 92561). The Naval Aircraft Factory built an week book for it, and it was put on displays in the Smithtonian Institution in very inaccurate markings. It was withdrawn from **The second production P\(\mathrm{C}\mathrm{2}\) (BuNos 9057) flying from USS MACON with its landing gear replaced by a third gallon auxiliary fuel tank.

It was then removed for refurbishment, painted accurately with its early USS MACON markings, and again put on exhibition for the 4 July 1976 opening of the new National Air & Space Museum in Washington, D.C.

After the FTC-1 contract, Curtis sold no more single-sent figures to the Navy in squadron strength until 1932. During this period, Boeing had become the sole supplier of Navy single-seats with its new FBI gers, twenty-seven FBI-48 j, forty-six FBI-2s, twenty-one F4B-3s and nine-very FBI-48 being delivered between mid-1928 and February of 1933.

This did not mean that Curtis was out of favor with the Navy. During that same period it sold twenty-five two-next FSC-4 and FSC-3 figures that were wedgelized as OLS and Co-2s, and twenty-five notably different FBC-4s that were named the Heldtler. These were followed by sixty-three FCS-5s that were delivered without arresting gear and were soon requested as OSC-1s. These were augmented by another thirty aircraft built at OSC-1s. Curtis also sold fifty-one NEC Fidelity primary trainers, thirty-one NEC-1s and twenty NEC-2s, to the Navy during the same period. Curtis was obviously not burning for Navy business.

The basic taper-wind I havebiane lighter made a comback at the F11C Goshawk. Since Curtis had advanced to all-metal construction with the FPC Sparrowhawk and some contemporary U.S. Army models, revival of the basic 1924 design was actually a step backward.

## 11c-1

While retaining the outlines of the old FSC-4, the new Goshawk that the Navy ordered in the XFF11C-1 Goshawk (Bulio 9217) was a return to the original FGC Hawk configuration of 1928 with many state-of-the-art upgrades. It featured a single-long time gear, coupled engine, and steerable let wheel with hydraulic shock absorber. The Bulio and model designation had not yet been painted on the tall. (Curtiss W-7775 via F. H. Dean)

April of 1932, as the XFF11C-1 (BuNo 9217, Curtis Model 64), was much more than an FGC-4 with a larger radial engine. It incorporated many modern features. The wings, still with the Clark's xridift, were now metal frames instead of wood. The allerosses and all tall surfaces were metal frames with metal skin, and the upper wing was raised three inches higher above the baseline.

The engine was the new experimental Wright SR-1510, a fourteen cylinder twin-row, air-cooled radial, that delivered 600 h at 2,100 m per 8,000 feet. Coverted by a full NACO covering, it drove a three-hole, eight for six inch diameter repeller. The smaller diameter

Early modifications to the XFF11C-1 included lengthening the landing gear and intating a larger-diameter two-blate propeller. The aircraft now carries the type code (XF11C-2) and Bulio on the tall. (Curtiss)The first flight was in October of 1932. The R-1510 engine proved to be unsatisfactory due to overheating, so various cowing arrangements were tried to overcome the cooling problems. The propeller was changed to a nine for ten inch diameter two blade unit and to maintain the required ground clearance, the handling gear leeps were lenghced. This also gave the aircraft a higher ground angle and permitted a lower landing speed. The three-blade propeller was soon restored, and the higher landing gear was retained.

The ZF11C-1 on the Navy 653.068, including GFE. In March of 1934, it was given the new Bomber-fighter designation XRPC-1 and soon after was turned over to NACA for research into the cooling of tightly-coupled radial engines. The XBPC-1 was retired in March of 1939, with only 319.4 hours of Navy flying time.

## XF11C-2

The KF11C-2 (BuNo 9213, Curtis Model 64A) is a bit confusing, because it has a later designation than the KF11C-1, but was an older aircraft with a lower BuNo. The Navy contract for the KF11C-2, an off-the-shelf Curtis Hurx II, also known as the Goshwalk, was signed and the naval configuration and Buso assigned to it before the contract for the yet-to-be-built XF11C-1, which was already designated as such, was signed and its Buso issued.

The KF11C-2 was an even longer backward step than the KF11C-1. The wings were again vomted and the all its were were filled every. A narrow Towned ring covered into the time-cylinder single-row Wright SR-1820F Cyclone engine that delivered 600 bp at 1950 nm at 8000 feet. A two-blade propeller was used and a lowered free plate covered the front of the carxbase. The landing gear was notably longer than the final form of the KF11C-1 and used smaller-diameter low-pressure headless. The third wheel was located farther forward than on the PC6L-2. Later, the KF11C-2, was modified to use the KF11C-1 tail wheel form and location, with a cut-out at the bottom of the radder.

The KF11C-2 (BuNo 9213) was an earlier airplane acquired by the Navy before the contract for the KF11C-1 was signed. Some of the differences were the longer landing gear legs and smaller-diameter low pressure trees, narrow Towned ring around a single-row Wright R-1820F Cyclone engine and underthethetheplace FGC type fuel tank. (Curities W-7243)

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:38]

the squatrons aboard aircraft carriers. All the squatrons on a particular ship now took the hall number of that ship as the squadron number. Squadronons aboard USS SARATOGA (CV-3) all became "threes". Accordingly, WB-2B Beene V9-3 for the bomber squadron, FF-6B, the fighter squadron, became FF-3, etc. The suffix letters designating the Bartle and Scoring Forces were eliminated. The tail colors also changed. Each carrier group now had its own color, so the old VF-1BVB-2B Red tail was changed to the White tail carried by all USS SARATOGA aircraft.

When PW-3's BTC-2s were replaced by two-event Vough SB21-1s, eleven of the Goshwaks were assigned to the new Ser IIAF Group that was then being formed for the new USS ENTERPRISE (CV-6) and joined Squadron VB-6 (formerly VB-8B), which was then flying Boeing FB4B-s. The BTC-2s were transferred to V8-6 during January and February of 1938, but few event aboard the ship when it was commissioned on 12 May 1938. Some were transferred out and others were damaged or scrapped. Three were surveyed on 10 June 1938, for "general wear incident to service." Three others were removed from the ship during its shake 

**YF11C-3**

The last modern feature added to the new wrenable Hawkijt plane was a retractable landing gear. The fifth production F11C-3 (BaNg 9269) was kept at the Curtiss factory for conversion to the XF11C-3 (Currits Model 67). It featured wheels that retracted flush into the modified lower nose. The retraction system was a chain drive, hand-crafted position by the pitch of Grumrumm that developed this system on amphibious granite flats and fused used to a production aircraft with the two-seat FF-1 fighter of 1931 and followed that with the E2F-1 single-seat fighter.

The modification added 230 pounds to the empty weight of the airframe, which used the same SR-28870 engine as the F1C-2. The added weight of the new landing gear and used center of gravity required that the new spring be used slightly for this original F11C-2 position. First flight of the XF11C-3 took place during April of 1931, with the aircraft being delivered in the Navy on 27 May 1933.

The aircraft's normal gross weight was 4.419 pounds and goodness gross weight was 4.800 pounds. The top speed was 216 mph at 8.000 feet with a two-blade fixed-pitch propeller. Later, the propeller was changed to variable-pitch, and the turtlecrack was changed to that used in the BFC-2. In its final form from the F1C-3 also had pilot-controlled elevator trim tubes, in addition to the original adjustable shoulder and meet controllable render out. In March of 1934, the XF11C-3 was redesigned as the XF2C-1 Bender-fighter.

On 24 September 1934, the XSPEC-1 experienced engine failure on takeoff from NAS Hampton Roads, Virginia and ditched in salt water. It was surveyed after accumulating 235 hours 45 minutes of Navy flight time.

## BF2C-1

Testing of the XF11C-3 resulted in a production order for twenty-seven F11C-3 (BaNos 96869761, Curtis Model 67A). These were all designated as BFC-3 by the time the first one free in September of 1934, where F11C-3, but the other free in September of 1934. The three-level was externally identical to the XF11C-3, but featured two major internal changes. The wings used the metal framework of the XF11C-4 and the airfish was changed to the NACA 2212. The engine was the R-1820-40 driving a controllable-pitch propeller and delivering 200 h to 8.000 feet (when the R-1820 mph numbers reached 100, the Navy started a new series at -02). The cost of a BFC-1, not including GFE, was 58318,000. The Navy's cost for the Cyclone engine was down to 55.5749.00.

Competition for the new was now provided by Grumm, not Boeing, which had gotten out of the bigtime fighter business after delivering the last R49B-4. Grumm received an order for fifty-four F2F-18, right after the BFC-2 order was placed.

Delivery of BFC-3 to Suganto VB-5B aboard the new carrier USS RANGEN (CV-4) began in November of 1934. When Green-tailed squadron was the only one to use the BFC-2, and in contrast to the F11C-2 BFC-2, in that the shortest career in carrier squadron service of any single-sueat Navy fighter.

As a market-purpose Navy airfing, the BFC-1 also operated at two gross weights. As a fighter it had an empty weight of 3.329 pounds and a gross weight of 4.555 pounds. Top speed was 225 mph at 8.000 feet and the service ceiling was 27.000 feet. As a bomber, empty weight was the same but the gross weight was 5.086 pounds. The top speed dropped to 215 mph and the service ceiling was lowered to 22,700 feet.

## BF2C-1 Service Problems

Totally unforeseen problems limited the BF2C-1s career to a little over a year. While the melt-frame Hawk wings were satisfactory on the Army XP-2 and the Navy XF11C-1, these aircraft had different engines than the BF2C-1. The natural period of vibration of the metal wings harmonized with the vibrations of the Cyclone engine with the result that the aircraft

**The XF11C-3 had a concave under lusselage section that partially enclosed the 500 pound bon or under fuselage test tank. There are flotation bag compartments in the tips of the upper wing. (Curfies)**nearly shook apart at cruising speed. This problem did not occur on the highly successful Curtis Hawk III, an export model that was identical to the BP2C-1, except for using wood-frame wings.

The Navy and Curtis tried in many ways to eliminate or at least reduce this unacceptable condition. Weights were attached to the wingtiers to change the wing harmonics, and for one test, the flying wires were steeped to tight that the metal interplane starts bowed. To see if some of the vibration was caused by air flow over the nose, a pusher propeller was installed on a water-cooled Curtis V-1570 engine mounted on a test stand and the blast was directed over the BP2C-1 as though from its own propeller.

A test of wooden Hawk III positions on a BP2C-1 came too late to save the operational career of the BP2C-1, the cost of replacement wings for the entire BP2C-1 fleet could not be justified. A related problem was at buffering caused by turbulent air-flow behind the 500 pound bomb or the auxiliary fuel tank and their associated attachments in the concave under fuse-age section. This was partially relieved by the addition of a semi-circular cowling that formed a ventur to smooth out the airflow ahead of the bomb of red fuel. The device had been tested on the XBP2C-1 and was fitted to BP2C-8 after they were in service.

A weak landing gear was another of the BP2C-1 strobings. All of these problems led to a withdrawal of the BP2C-1 form service with W-S2 between October of 1935 and February of 1936. They were replaced with old Boeing F4B-4s until the squadron could be re-equipped with new Grumman F3F-Is. The BF2C-1 situation led to serious Navy correspondence on the subject of Curtis's suitability as a designer and builder of Naval aircraft.

Following their withdrawal from the fleet, Curtis proposed a weight reduction program for the BF2C-1 with a view to their being used as fighter-rinanes at Fensola. This idea was rejected. In January of 1937, a letter from the Secretary of the Navy directed that nineteen of the surviving BF2C-Is, not including two then being used in test programs, be grounded and scrapped because they were considered uniform for use to deceive vibration. It is reported that those stationed in San Diego were stripped of their engines and other useful equipment, loaded on horses, and dumped at sea. A sorry female to the one year career of the 132 taper-winged Navy Hawks.

The high-time BP2C-1 (Buso 9601) has only 295 hours on it when. it was finally grounded.

This Green-called BP2C-1 (Buso 9601) was assigned to USS EITERPENSE (CV-4) has the canopy in the fully open position. The BP2C-1 had an inset rudder tab and mass balances added to the elevators in attempt to reduce tail future. (A.U. Schmidt Collection)Civil And Export Hawks

A total of 301 taper-winged Hawks biplane fighters were built for other customers, compared to 238 for the U.S. Army and 132 for the U.S. Navy (not including the straight-wing FTC and FPC models). While all of these appear on the master list of Curtis aircraft, not all are matched to the retroactive 1935 Curtis model numbers.

Until 1930, the Curtis experts spent sales name matched the equivalent U.S. military model. From 1930 onwards, all expert aircraft were identified as Hawks followed by a Roman Numeral; i.e., P-6 air extremes were Hawk Is and Hawk Ix, F11C-2 airlines were Hawk Is, etc.

The biplane Hawks built as demonstrators carried U.S. civil registrations, which were canceled if the aircraft was sold abroad. One widely used demonstrator, the Doolithic Hawks, retained its original registration after finding how American owner. Another Hawk, the Al Williams famous Guhlhrasse, still has its 1930 registration and is currently on display in the U.S. Marine Aviation Museum Quantity, Virginia.

By the time the Hawk II went on the market, the biplane Hawks was obsolescent by the standards of the world's major air forces, and it made no technical contributions to the subsequent designs of other nations. Although unknown at the time, one sale was to have a major effect subsequent aviation history.

Erst Uder, Germany's highest-costing surviving First World War Ace (62 vicories), one of the world's leading aerobic pilots, and an aircraft designer, was greatly inspected by Al Williams' demonstrations of precision dive-bombing in Guhlhrasse 1 at the National Air Races. Uder then persuaded the German Air Ministry to purchase two Hawk Is for the still-secret Littlewite to be used in the study and evaluation of vertical dye-bombing techniques. The result was the notorious Jurkers Ju 87 Suka and its widespread use by the Lutfawite in the Second World War II.

The first German Hawk II was delivered early in 1934 with German civil registration D-3165. This was changed to D-IRIS when the German registration system was changed from numbers to letters later that year. The second was delivered as D-IRIS.

The export Hawk I for Japan was similar to the water-cooled U.S. Army P-6 Hawk modified with a larger chin radiator. While under test in the U.S., the aircraft carried the civil registration 72K on the rudder in Black. (Couris T-5652)

* There is reason to believe that these aircraft may have actually been delivered to Peru for service in its war against Colombia. It is known that three Sea Hawk IIs and one land Hawk II were used by Peru, although no Curtis records reveal a contract or delivery date.
* When Curtis released photographs of the export Japanese Hawk, they mis-spelled the name and called the aircraft the Japanese Hawk.

Figure 1: The Haux list to Colombia between 1932 and 1934 could be found either as long planes or as float seagplanes. When on floats, the Haux list had a small finet installed below the twealage which was necessary to maintain directional stability when operating on floats. The plot of this Haux list (See) has left the water rudders in the down position. (Currits via F.M. Dean)

(Above & Right) Four Siamese (That) fighter squadrons were equipped with Hawk lifts during late 1940 when France and Stam engaged in a short border war. The Hawks flew escort, Interception and dive-bombing missions against French forces based in Inodice. Later these figures again saw section 7 December 1941, when Japanese forces moved Thailand. One Hawk in remains preserved In Thailand as part of the Thai Air Force Museum at Don Young Air Base, near Banglock. Shortly after they were delivered, Thai Hawk lifts were camodified with two 2000 Brown and Green uppermosteces over Light Blue underestimates. During the fighting with France, the Hawks carried a representation of the Thai flag on the wings. After the Japanese occupation, the Hawks carried the Running Elephant Insight, which was used until 1945. The blister on the fuselage side covers the machine gun breech and the corving throat is notched to allow clearance for the guns. (Curies)One of the 102 Hank IIIs delivered to China on the other ramp of a Chinese air base during 1944. By this time the fabrics were used as advanced trainers. Aircraft 88 was overall Dark Brown with White numbers and Blue and White rudder stripes. The aircraft was modified with a three blade propeller and, contrary to some reports, none of the Hawk III were built from scratch in China, although many were assembled from this provided by Curtis. Chinese Hawk III carried the national singing on the top of the upper wing and underside of the lower wing. This aircraft has the fuselage gun blisters deleted.
