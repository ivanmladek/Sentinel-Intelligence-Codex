## Introduction

Assaint and intra-theater transport aircraft have played a major role in every conflict since their development just before the start of the Second World War. Both powered aircraft and gliders have been used to deliver assault troops to the battlefield and to keep them resupplied with the tools needed to make war.

In the years stay prior to the outbreak of the Second World War, German, British and American aircraft designers all developed military or modified civilian aircraft for the trooper carrier/assuit transport. The German's developed the hars 19 2011 while the British and Americans mainly used the Douglas C-47 (a military version of the DC-3 airifiner).

Assault and cargo glider forces get their start during the war when the Germans used asgilders do May 740 against the Knane, Vepldemerica and Voremanblen bridges in Holland. The success of these operations caught the attention of a number of aircraft manufacturers who began to design their own assault gliders. In the US. Was too too much lead and produced not USAMP gliders, the majority of them being the CG-48. The CG-48 was destined to be the only U.S. made glider to see action during the Second World War.

Although successful, the glider lacked one important element, its own power. Once the glider landed, its mission was complete, since the glider could not return to base on their own. This shortcoming was addressed early, on, in Germany and in the U.S. The German GONG 042 glider was fitted with air cooled engines and the glean Messersmitt 100. The 321 glider once envisioned as a cargo transport glider for the mission of England was fitted with six air cooled engines becoming the 323 600ar. This aircraft was used to resup General Irwin Rommers Africa Koro Hyra signs across the Med from Italy to North Africa.

The success of German powered gliders did not escape the attention of British and American glider designers. In England, the General Aircraft Ltd. Hamicar was equipped with this engines, becoming the Hamicar X. It was not as widely produced as the German designs, although after the War Bristol developed the Hamicar into the Bristol 170.

Despite that, predicting some 200 aircraft for both the RAF and all market. In America, Waco installed two Franklin engines on the CG-4, converting it to the PG-1. As in England, the design did not enjoy the success of the German aircraft. It was not until the Chase Airtern Company of Trento, New Jersey, modified the CG-1. glider to take two air cooled model engines, under the designation C-122, did an American design begin to show promise.

Chase Aircraft, under the design leadership of Michael Stroudkopf, pioneered manufacture of all metal glides with the CG-18. The CG-18 was basically an all metal variant of the CG-14 cargo glider. The US Airborne forces resumed an aircraft that could carry the large artillery pieces needed to support airborne casual and on 2 December 1946, the Chase Airtern Company received a contract for two large all-metal gliders that could carry up to 1600 pounds of cargo.

The new design region revolve the company designations MS-8AVITRUK (Michael Stroudkopf Design Number 8) and the military designation XCG-20. The XCG-20 was a high wing. all metal glider with a reinforced most assettion for maximum crash protection and a strong tow connection. The XCG-20 featured atively retractable landing gear and hydraulically operated slotted flags with power for the hydraulic pump being supplied from an on board auxiliary power unit (APU). The XCG-20 command accounts for fully equipped troops or fifty filter patients. The glider had a maximum taxel weight of 70,600 pounds, although at the time, there were no two aircraft available that could get such a weight into the air, so the maximum taxel weight was restricted to 40,000 pounds.

The XCG-20 had a wing span of 110 feet and a length of 77 feet 1 inch. The cargo compartments was firstly feeting, twelve feet wide and ten feet high. From thequet, Michael Stroudkopf had decided that this glider would eventually be opened. Two prototypes were built (47-786 and 47-787) and the first of the 47-786 was chosen for conversion power. The aircraft was fitted with two 1,900 by Pratt and Whitney R-2800-CB-15 air cooled radial engines. Since the aircraft had been designed as glider, no provisions had been made for fuel. As a result, the fuel had to be carried externally, rather than in internal wing or fuselage tanks. The rear of the engine nacules became the fuel tanks and these tanks were unusual in that they could be jetisiened in an emergency.

The powered version of the XCG-20 was given the designation XC-123 and made its first flight from the company's West Trenton, N.J. facility on 14 October 1949. The XC-123 was actually the first of the two XCG-20 prototypes to fly, the glider not making its first flight until 26 April 1950.

The prototype Chase XC-123 successfully completed its flight test period and Chase was issued a production contract for 300 aircraft under the designation C-123B. Chase Atzenbration construction of the C-123B at its Trenton, N. J. facility during 1952 and, after completing five C-123B, a majority interest in the Chase Company was purchased by the Kaiser-Fraser Company under the leadership of Henry J. Kaiser. Contract dispatutes between Kaiser and the USAF resulted in the 300 aircraft under contract to Chase being cancelled by the USAF.

The USAF part the C-123B production contract up for bids and the Fairchild Engine and Airplane Corporation was awarded the contract during 1953. The new contract was for a total of 302 C-123B. The second XCG-20 glider prototype was later fitted with four 1-J7 jet engines (in two twin pools) and redesignated the XC-123A. The Chase XC-20 would hold the distinction of being the only aircraft to have flow in four different modes: unpowered glider, piston power, jet power and, in the final C-123T variant, turbo-prop power.

The first production XCG-20 glider was fitted within a quarter of order coded Pearl A window B-2800-a3

Double Wased radial engines and first point on 14 October 1949. The Chase Accret Company and the direction of Michael Strokoff had developed the NS-4 as both a powered and glider assault transport for the USAF. (National Archives)XC-123A

The second prototype XCG-20 glider (47-787) was fitted with a twin jet engine pod under each minor using section. These pods each contained a pair of 5.300 long General Electric-47/G-E11 turbojet engines, the same as those used on the Boeing B-47 Cartapiet medium bomber. With these engines the aircraft, now designated the XC-123A, achieved a top speed of 500 mph. The aircraft ends had the distinction of being the first American-built air jet transport. The XC-123A made its first ignition on 21 April 1951, possi smits months after the piston powered C-123B.

With the exception of the jet pod, the XC-123A was externally identical to the XCG-20 glider. The jet engines enabled the XC-123A to take off at a gross weight of 60,000 pounds, while the glider was restricted, by a lack of a fuller two aircraft, to a takeoff weight of 40,000 pounds.

The fuel for the XC-123A prototype was carried in the fuselage in tanks installed under the cargo load floor since no provisions had been made for internal wing tanks. Flight rates of the USAF demonstrated that the aircraft had good short field takeoff and tangling capabilities, but the low hanging padded jet engines tended to ingest foreign objects damaging the low slung jet engines. This restricted flight operations to paved airstrips, severely limiting the tactical use of the XC-123A.

With this fact in mind, a decision was made by the USAF to remove the jet engines and replace them with air cooled radial engines. Once the modification was completed, the XC-123A was redesigned as the YC-123D and the serial number was changed from 47-787 to 53-8088.

C-123B Provider

Once the service test flights of the prototype XC-123 were successfully completed the Air Force awarded Chase Aircraft of East Trenton, Newfers, a contract for the production aircraft under the designation C-123B (serials S2-1627 through 52-1631).

The C-123B differed very little from the XC-123, with the exception of the vertical stabilizer. The rounded shape of the XC-123 was replaced by a taller more square shape on the C-123B.

The power plants used on the XC-123, the 1,9000 Pratt and Whitney R-2800 CB-15s, were replaced by 2,500 bp Pratt and Whitney R-2800 CB-15s, engines made it necessary to replace the engine oil cooler from under the engine needle on an internal location inside the needle.

The first production Chase C-123B (52-1627) took to the air during early 1953 and in May of 1953, Henry J. Kaiser purchased a minority interest in the Chase Aircraft Company, being not the fact that Chase had just received a contract from the UKF for 300 C-123Bs. Kaiser had been building the Fairchild C-119 Flying Boxcar under contract at his Willow Run, Michigan facility. Kaiser eventually purchased a majority interest in Chase Aircraft and thought he had the 300 aircraft contract locked to buy. During the Second World War, Kaiser had made a number of enemies in the various war procurement departments and on 24 June 1953 the U.S. Air Force notified Kaiser that once the C-119 contract was filled, no further contracts with Kaiser would be honored. This meant that the 300 aircraft contract that has assumed would be his once be bought Chase Aircraft was now useless.

The contract was put up for bid and the Fairchild Engine and Airplane Corporation of Flagworth, Maryland won the contract. Fairchild took over five Chase-built C-123B and responsibility for further development and production. During flight tests of the C-123B, a directional stability problem was uncovered that resulted in the installation of a large dorsal in extension the front of the vertical stabilizer. This became a standard production and recognition feature on the Fairchild C-123B.

The first production Fairchild C-123B aircraft differed very little from the Chase C-123B and the first Fairchild C-123B (S4-552) made its first flight on 1 September 1954 from Hagerstrom, Maryland. One of C-123B (S4-565) was used as a test aircraft to test a refinement in the nose gear and its associated gear retraction system and gear doors. A change was also made to the shape of the rear cockpit windows with the rounded windows being replaced by windows with a trapezoid shape. Fully C-123B and pilot and co-pilot side windows that opened outward, but this feature was eliminated on later aircraft (Block 4 production aircraft, serial 54-576 wonard). Additionally, later C-123B had the shape of the topo and crew entrance doors changed with the rounded shape being replaced by a squared of design. The Fairchild C-123B had a wing span of 110 feet, an overall length of 75 feet 9 inches and a height of 34 feet 1 inch. The cargo hold had a length of 35 feet and a total capacity of 3,570 cubic feet.

The C-123B could accommodate to sixty fully equipped troops or fifty stretcher patients. The cargo was loaded via a hydraulically operated rear fuselage ramp. For parachute missions, troops could exit through troop doors on either side of the rear fuselage.

During early 1955 Fairchild, in a private venture, fitted Fairchild J-44 jet engines to the wing tips of the first production Chase-built C-123B (52-1627). The 1,000 lbst J-44 jet engines were beingused on target drones and guided missiles and were intended to boost the C-123B rate of climb and to add a margin of safety in the event of an engine failure on takeoff. The full Fairchild C-123B made its first flight on 1 September 1954, plotted by E.R. (Dutch) Gehm. The Fairchild C-123B offered from the Chase aircraft in the addition of a dorsal fin. The fins was added to correct a lateral control problem found in the Chase C-123 aircraft. (Pauchis)

## 1 Introduction

The C-123B began active USAF service with the 309th Troup Carrier Group, based at Pope Air Force Base, North Carolina during July of 1955. Once in active service the Chasesagined name, Artiurk, was replaced by the USAF assigned name, Provider. This was mainly to differentiate between the Chase and Fairchild-built aircraft and also to identify its actual use as a "proorder" of cargo to the troops in the field.

The Civil Aeronautics Authority (CAA), the foremer of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), purchased one C-123B (55-455B) from the Air Force in June of 1957. The purchase price of $877,000 included ground support equipment and some spares. The CAA sent the C-123B to Alaska and used it to test navigational aids and Instrument Landing Systems (US) at various airports throughout the state. The CAA assigned the civil registration 1132 to the C-123B.

The 503th Air Transport Squadron also operated the C-123B in Alaska, flying out of England Air Force Force. These aircraft were used to resolve the remote Distant Early Warning (DEVR) radar sites scattered across northern Alaska and the Arctic regions. The Alaska Air Command would operate the C-123B and other models in Alaska and the Arctic until 1975.

During 1958, the U.S. Coast Guard Guard is C-123B (this number gradually increasing to eleven by 1965) fitted with an AN/APN-1588 each radar in a bulbous nose radon under the designation HC-123B. The aircraft were affectioned called _Thunder Ray_ by the airecuss because of the shape of the nose and the noise of the Pratt and Whitney R2800s engines. The HC-123B were utilized both in the transport and search and rescue tools from air stations in Naples, Italy, Kodriak, Alaska, Burchers Point, Hawaii and Miami. Florida. The HC-123B was used by the Coast Guard as an interim aircraft until the arrival of the Lockheed HC-130B. The HC-123B was gradually phased out of service and by 1971 none remained on active service with the USCG. One HC-123B (56-4557) was presented to the government of Thailand during the Vietnam war and was later converted to turbowper power during 1980.

The USAF aerial demonstration team, the Thunderbirds, used five C-123Bs in the 1958-1961 time frame. Three of these aircraft (474, 517, 647, 624 and 548) were painted in the Red, White and Blue Thunderbird pana scheme, while the other two support aircraft remained in the standard natural scheme. One Thunderbird C-123B (54-671) was lost in September of 1964 due to the combination of a possible in flight fire in the air-layer wind power at (April one), at a call on takeoff.

In 1961, an attempt to aid the government of South Vietnam in its fight against the guertila forces of the Viet Copa. A contingent of C-123B were dispatched to South Viet Nam under project _Male Thin_. The aircraft came from the 346th Troup Carrier Squadron and new from Pope AFB, North Carolina to Saigon's, Tan Son Nhut Air Base, arriving in "country 2.2 January 1967.

The _Male Fine_ C-123B were not the first to deploy South Vietnam; that distinction belonged to the USAT Special Aerial Sparsity Flight. These aircraft, known by their Project name, _Ranch Hand_, were part of Operation PINK ROSE and were attached to the 315th Troup Carrier Wing. The spray flights operated specially equipped TC-123Bs. The aircraft were modified with a chemical tank and pressure equipment in the cargo bay and spray booms mounted on the wing undersurface and under the rear fliesize. Six aircraft began operating along the Ho Chi Minh Trail that separated South Viet Nam from Cambodia and Laos during November of 1961.

During one of the early spray flights, on 2 February 1962, the USAF lost its first C-123 (and its crew of three) in Vietnam. This event marked the first of some fifty-four C-123Blost in both combat and on routine operations. The spray flights continued until 1972 when Project _Ranch Hand_ was disbanded. One of the best known _Ranch Hand_ aircraft was a UC1-23B (54-64GB) named Funde. The aircraft was so named because it received over 1000 hits in combat operations over South Viet Nam.

A few C-123B were converted to NC-123B standards (the N stood for Permanent Special Test). The NC-123B were fitted with Forward Looking Infrared Detectors in the nose and some aircraft were also fitted with a radon above the cockpit area. The NC-123B were used along the Hoi Ch Minhail to locate track traffic for aircraft. The aircraft 123B were found by mixed excess consisting of USAP personnel as well as members of the Vietnamese Air Force (VNA) and Nationals Chinese sireme. This clandestine operation eventually became known as Operation DICKO.

Another C-123B was fitted with bands of high intensity lamps mounted on an unobvious housing in the easy. Although it slightly at two and one half mile area, it was discovered that the installation had a few drawbacks in combat that caused it to be removed from service. Since the lights were attached to the aircraft, unlike a flare, energy anti-arcarcraft (AA) gunes could easily track the lamps. Secondly, the heat from the lamps made it necessary to install large blowers on the sides of the fuselage. As a result of these problems, the project was cancelled and the aircraft was withdrawn from combat.

**Steam fires from the heating units used to warm the engines of this C-123B during Exercise Polar Shuffle held in 1965. In freezing weather, the engine of that to be heated before attempting to start the engines. (USAAP)**

One C-123B (54-683) was experimentally fitted with the Fulton Recovery Device, an apparatus consisting of two booms protruding from the nose of the aircraft at 45deg angle. The booms were designed to engage a wire cable suspended from a balloon, with a stranded pilot to the other of the cable. The C-123B was used to determine the feasibility of the design before it was fitted to USAP HC-1050 and Rescue aircraft.

During the war in Vietnam, one C-123B was converted for use by GEN William Westward command command of U.S. forces in Vietnam, under the designation VC-123B.

The L23B was also shown by a number of foreign nations. In 1956, the Venezuelan Air Force(AVAV) performed eighteen C-123B under an Military Assistance Program (MPMP) con-Tract. The C-123B, called funded by IAB, overfitted with the 6th Transport Squadron out of Marsev until replaced the Italian Aertila (G22 in 1983).

The Royal Saudi Air Force (ISAF) operated its C-123B with No4 Squadron. These aircraft were provided to the RSAF under MAP assistance and operated out of Jeddah until 1967 when they were replaced by Lockheed C-130s.

Air America (CIA) Laos, Cambolia, South Korea, the Philippines, Taiwan, Thailand and South Vietnam all operated the C-123B. A total of 302 C-123B were produced by Fairchild and five were built by Chase. Of these, only a few remain in operation today.

**This C-123B (54-650) served with the 46th TrooC Carrier Wing at Pope AFB, North Carolina. The nose comes us Green with a four pointed White star and the tall and outer wing panels were Rad. The aircraft carried the role designation "Troop Carrier" on the nose in Black. (Jim Sullivan)**
A.C-1238 (55-4564) of the 5030th Mar Transport Solution based at Elmendorf Air Force Base, Alaska, was used to measure the latent Early Wiring (PGN) and communication sites in Alaska. The C-1238 served in Alaska until 1975. (USAF wia John Close)

In 1968, the USAF ordered all non-identical transport aircraft to be painted an overall Light Gulf Gas. Ying. Ch-1238 (55-4567) served with the 21st Composite Wiring in Alaska in April of 1970. The metadata carried offed Arctic markings on the nose, using tips and horizontal and vertical stabilizer. (Norm Taylor)

**Durling 1958, the United States Coast Guard (USCG) began reacting the HC-123B. The HC-123B was simply a C-123B airborne modified with an AN/APAP-158 search radar andadone in the nose. Trials MC-123B (55-4540) was assigned to the USCG base at Nagles, Italy. (USCG wg R.L. Schients)**

The RSAF procured six C-123B8 from USAF stocks during 1957, allircraft serving with Korea. This material was the tenth Parchicule Swift C-123B, (5th, Onchak via Taylor)

Avenazuku Ar Force (FN) C-123B (see-USAF-57-1903), Venezuela received eighteen C-123B8 during 1988 under the Military Assistance Program. The C-123B8 remained in service until 1983 when they were replaced by Australia G222s. The C-123 was called the "Pandy" by the FNP plots. (Col. Cesar Ricon, FA)YC-123D

There was noC-123C production variant since the proposed VC-123C staff transport was canceled when the USAF decided to purchase the Convair VC-131D.

The VC-123D was a re-engined Chase XC-123A, modified by Strouckoff Aircraft of Trenton, New Jersey. The four poded jet engines on the XC-123A were replaced by two Praft and Whitney R-200M to avoid ideal engines and in this new configuration the aircraft, designated the VC-123D, made its first night of 7 December 1954.

The engine change also brought about a change in the serial number from 47-787 (XC-123A) to 53-808 (YC-123D). This change can about because the XC-123A was produced by Chase Aircraft and the YC-123D was extensively modified by Strouckoff Aircraft, becoming basically a new aircraft.

Filed with a Boundary Layer Control (BLC) system, the YC-123D exhibited far greater than second second second second second and landing distance. The Boundary Layer Control system featured at midwether high pressure being blown over the wing supter surface and the control surfaces. This made the wing and control as at the aircraft was flying at a much higher airspeed. Tests at the Wright Air Development Center (The slow, Orion Showards that the VC-123D (AT 50.000 persons gross behind a lackoff distance of 580 pc, compared to 1.950 feet for a standard C-123B. The landing distance was also reduced from 1.200 feet to 75 feet.

The success of the these tests prompted the USAF to issue a contract to Strouckoff for six additional TC-123D. In the event, the contract was shortwired, due in part to another development by Strouckoff of the basic C-123A aftermare, the VC-123D. This aircraft was lifted not only with BLC equipment, but also with _Hunobase_ equipment which would enable the C-123 to land on any surface. As a result, no further orders were issued for YC-123D.

The VC-123D (53-808) was the re-engined XC-123A. The jet pools used on the XC-123A were replaced with Praft & Whitney R2800 radial engines and the vertical stabilizer was altered to the entry C-123B configuration. The VC-123D was fitted with a Boundary Layer Control (BLC) system. (David Menard)

The success of the these tests prompted the USAF to issue a contract to Strouckoff for six additional TC-123D. In the event, the contract was shortwired, due in part to another development by Strouckoff of the basic C-123A aftermare, the VC-123D. This aircraft was lifted not only with BLC equipment, but also with _Hunobase_ equipment which would enable the C-123 to land on any surface. As a result, no further orders were issued for YC-123D.

## Appendix C C-123E

Following the success of the Stroukoff YC-123D, a follow-on contract was issued for a new airframe that would employ not only the Boundary Layer Control (BLCs) system but also the new _Hundhouse_ equipment. The _Hundhouse_ system consisted of a sealed fusage, a pair of highly stressed water/hosw skis and a pair of wing mounted loads. Using this system, a land based aircraft could be modified to operate from land, water, snow or ice.

The entirely new airframe (5-4031) was built at the West Tenton, New Jersey facility and first from a 28 July 1956 "On Mercer Airport." The YC-123E was powered by two Pratt and Whitney B-2009-Patal engines during four blade Hamilton Standard constant speed fully feathering and reversible properties instead of the normal three blade Hamilton Standard units used on the C-123B.

In addition to the _Hundhouse_ equipment, the crew escape doors were also modified. The doors were sealed and shortened, requiring the crew to enter and exit from the rear cargo door. Additionally, a sample pump was installed in the fusage to keep any water leak from ships the aircraft.

After the initial bulders trials, the aircraft was flown to the Mustin Naval Air Station located near the Philadelphia Navy Yard for water trials on the Delaware River. Takeloff from the water was accomplished by lowering the skis at about 20 miles per hour. The plot gently sensed back on the control column and the skis would act like a hydro-foil and raise the aircraft of the surface.

The performance of the YC-123E was reduced by about 2% due to the added dragon of the wing mounted floats and the untrobedy skis. Empty weight increased from 31.058 pounds to 33.558 pounds and contains speed was reduced from 190 mph (C-123B) to 179 mph (C-123E).

The YC-123E proved to be completely ambitious and was tested extensively at Palm Beach AFB and Lake Okeechboe, Florida. Following these tests, the aircraft was flown to Bezridi, Minnesota for cold weather testing where it established a record for ski operations.
YC-123H

During 1956, in the middle of the C-123B production run, Fairchild pulled one aircraft (company serial 2016) from the assembly line and began a modification program that would eventually lead to the YC-123H.

Completed in early 1957, by the YC-123H (54-2956) featured a new wide track main landing gear taken from a Lockheed C-130A Hercules transport. The landing gear track was increased by 5.5 feet resulting in a third-four percent reduction in turning radius. The new safe alloy allowed for an increase in gross weight to 67,000 pounds. The prototype landing was tested under all types of conditions and an all types of terrain.

After the success of the earlier Fairchild C-123B let augmentation program in 1955, the USAF for a contract to Fairchild in May 1962 to further modify the YC-123H by installing two nondworking mounted bonded cycles engines and acceleration pathset. These modifications were completed in July, less than 90 days following the signing of the contract. Following a series of taxi tests, the YC-123H took to the air of the first time on a 30 July 1962.

Following comparison light tests, the YC-123H was shown to Eigin AFS, Florida for evaluation against the C-130B, A-YC-130A (an improved C-130A, B-C equipped NC-130 and a production C-123B. The evaluations took place during October 1962 and, later, the YC-123H was set to Vietnam for tests in the counter-insurgurg support role (January through April of 1963).

The wing mounted General Electric C-610-1 (J-85-1) engines installed on the YC-123H produced by 2800 J-850B while using standard 115/145 aviation gasoline. The increased thrust of the jet engines enabled the YC-123H to increase it payload to 20,165 pounds (0.75/200 rpm) for a C-123B. Takedoff distance was also reduced from 904 feet (C-123B) to 756 feet (C-123H).

During the tests conducted in South Vietnam, the YC-123H debut a total of 180 missions (360 flight hours) at an average gross weight of 65,000 pounds. The YC-123H flew into fields as short as 880 feet, while the average field length was only 1,500 feet.

During the evaluation, the YC-123H was shown by the 315H Group. Upon completion of the tests in Vietnam, the YC-123H was returned to the United States. Additional testing took place during the balance of 1963 until the aircraft was destroyed in an accident in late 1963.

The flight testing of the YC-123H proved successful and the knowledge gained with this aircraft was carried over to the C-123K. In effect, the YC-123H served as the prototype for the C-123K.

C-123J

Once the U. S. began operating the Distant Early Warning (DEW) line in Alaska during the mid-1950s, the Air Force realized it needed an aircraft that could deliver supplies and other materials in the news manning the remote radar sites that made up the line. The USAR found that the Douglas C-47 was not capable of a full gross weight takeoff from a snow runway and sought a replacement aircraft.

During 1955, Fairchild had experimented with mounting Fairchild 1,000 post-1, started 44.9 s, ejecting gaps on the untips of the prototype Chase C-123B (56-267). These engines were small expendable turbopsets used on target drones, such as the Ryan Firebee. The J48 not only provided additional thrust for tascoff, they also provided a margin of safety in the event of an engine failure on tascoff, often disavours in a C-123B.

In 1957, the South Operations Squadron of the Alaska Air Command began receiving Fairchild C-123B for use in the surprisingly expensive communications and DEN line sites spread all over Alaska. Philos soon found that, like the C-47, the C-123B was a little underpowered and could not take off from snow at full gross weight.

Remembering Fairchild's tests with jet augmentation, the USAF requested that Fairchild modify perfusion of the C-123B with 44 jet engines under the designation C-123J (geaths 54-647 and 56-388 through 56-4396).

The first C-123B aircraft modified to the C-123J standards was also equipped with a retractable ski system attached to the landing gear. The first flight of asi equipmentC-123J was on 23 October 1957. The ski extended and retracted along with the landing gear and the nose gear six was fitted with a housing that far fired the skin into the nose. Following the success of the ski equipped C-123J, three other aircraft were also modified with ski landing gear. (56-439), 56-439 and 4395.

The C-123B were assigned to the 4083rd Strategic Wing, Strategic Air Command, at Harmon Air Base, Newfoundland. Later they were transferred to the 144th Medium Air Transport Squadron, Alaska Air National Guard. The unit began operating the C-123J during 1958 and the pilots found the C-123J far superior to the C-123B, due in part for the increased power from the 4-14 jet engines.

While in Alaska, the C-123J was never lost all sorts of missions, from assisting in search and rescue operations to supporting Harvard University in glacier research, the ski-equipped C-123J were used to fly teams out to Take Glacier near Junean. The ski equipped C-123J was were affoculatedly called "Ski-Birds," since they could land virtually anywhere in Alaska. The C-123B flew with the 144th Transport Squadron until 19/3 were then were replaced by Accel C-130s.

One C-123B (56-4558x123) was operated by the Federal Aviation Authority (FAA) for flight checks of navigational aids and Instrument Landing Systems (II.S)throughout Alaska. This aircraft was also modified to C-123J standards. A few C-123J's remain, mainly in mesures. The Alsaxian Aviation Heritage Museum in Anchorage, Alaska has a 1-235(649) on display, although it is in civilian markings anddoors. The Alsaxian Air National Guard, also in Anchorage, has a C-123J (56-4395) on display in a Natural Metal finish with the Red-Orange identification panels.

C-123K

Following the success of the YC-123H tests in South Vietnam during 1962, the USAF issued Fairchild a contract to modify 183 C-123B aircraft with auxiliary jet engines mounted under the wings under the designation C-123K. These aircraft would be sent to Vietnam for use in the intra-cheater transport role.

The contract called for the installation of an underhegion proh mounted 2,850 host General Electric R-85-GE-17 auxiliary rubber engine under each wing. The main landing gear was also fitted with the Goodyear high capacity wheels, brakes or mati-sidk outside of the system. As a result, asymmetric system also has installed, which consisted of a computer unit, an angined attack transmitter to the stardard wing and a stall warning stick shaker.

The first C-123K (54-851) few from Hargestown, Maryland on 27 May 1966 and the last C-123K was delivered in September of 1969. As soon as all testing had been certified and interviewing completed, the first C-123K was delivered by South Vietnam Vietnam, replace the aging C-123B, The C-123K was successfully assigned to the Israeli Aircraft Wing at Phan Rang Air Base. The UC-123B aircraft serving with the 12th Air Command Squadron was also modified to C-123K standards and a total of thirty-four UC-123B were converted to UC-123K.

With the exception of the jet engine pole, the C-123K was externally identical to the earlier C-123B. Empty weight free from 13,058 C-123B to 35,600ants C-123K.

Maximum takoff weight remained the same for both aircraft at 6,000 pounds and the maximum speed for 0.28 mph.

The single C-123B (56-4573) used by GEN Nystromolanda is his personal transport was also converted to C-123K, standarding with 1968 and promptly returned to South Vietnam. The UC-123K was chtened the "White" Snake" since the upper fuselage was painted White to help reflect the heat of the tropical sun.

The only transport pilot during the Vietnam war to be awarded the Medal of Honor was LTCOI, Joe M. Jackson of the 31th Air Command Squadron (ACS), AC-123K pilot, LTCOI, Jackson was on a check ride with MAJIese Campbell when they received a radio call for help from the US. Special Forces Camp at Khan Duc. With total disregard for his own safety, he made at the besesed airfield and rescued the remaining members of the Comb Control team from death or capture the hands of the North Vietnamese Army (NVA). For his gallumhers, he was awarded the Medal of Honor. MAJ Campbell received the Air Force Cross and the rest of the crew was awarded the Silver Star.

The last US/C-123K mission in South Vietnam was low on 14 June 1972. On landing the aircraft was turned over to the South Vietnamese Air Force (NANAF). Training for VNAF C-123B reads high enough in 1970. VNAF C-123B jobs began their training at Lockbourne AFB, Ohio, qualifying as copious. Upon return to South Vietnam, the Vietnamese lips flow with the 31st Drop Center Air Wing alongside USAT pilots.

The first C-123K and the third C-123K target with the 42st Transport Squadron (421st TS) was formed in April of 1971. Following the success of the 421st TS, two other quadrants were formed, the 423rd and 42rd, allshire under the 53rd Tactical Wing, at Tan Son Nhut Air Base, Saigon.

The C-123K was also used by the 606th Special Operation Squadron at Nakhon Phanom Air Base. Thailand, not only in the transport role but also in the flare ship mission. This role, called "C-123K's dropping flares is supported by throughs in Cambodia and Loos.

The USAF also supplied a number of Allied air forces with C-123K's from their inventory in South Vietnam. Thailand, Cambodia and the Philippines all received C-123Ks, the majority being taken from the 31st Pister Operations Wing Upon the UCR. With additional from South Vietnam in 1973, all C-123s in the USar were turned over to the USAF Reserves.

During 1986, Harry Doan, owner of Doan Helicopters in Dayton Beach, Florida sold his surplus C-123K (54-679) to Southern Aire. The aircraft was then transferred to the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). Given an overall Gray paint scheme, the aircraft was given the civil registration N4410F and deployed to Central America. The aircraft was shot down over Nicaragua and the only survivor was Eugene Hassenfus, an American working for the CIA supplying arms to the Contras who were engaged in a guerrilla war with the Sandarissa of Nicaragua.

The U.S. State Department operates four C-123Ks to carry supplies for the Narcotics Assistance Units in the northern South American area, especially the Hualing Valley of Peru. The aircraft are painted overall Grays and have a radome installed on the nose. The radar appears to be similar to the type employed by the Sikorsky HH-3F Pelican. During 1989, one of the C-123Ks was absorbed while it sat on the ramp at Bogata, Columbia, a victim of the long and ongoing drug war with the Medellin Cartel.

A few countries are exposed to retain their C-123Ks well into the 1990s, including El Salvador, South Korea, Laos, Taiwan, Thailand and the Philippines.

This C 1-23K (54-843) served with the 4408th Combt Craw Training Squadron at Eglin Ar Force Base, Florida. C-123 crews were trained in short field operations at Eglin. This particular C-123K had been previously fitted with a Fullton Recovery System on the nose. (USAF, via R. Banston)

In December of 1965, the USAF began Project Black Spot. This project was designed to give the USAF self-contained night attack capability to seek out and destroy targets on the Ho Chi Minh trial at night. The concept was approved by the DOD and two C-123Ks (S4-69) and S4-698) were modified by E-Systems of Greenville, Texas to the NC/AC-123K configuration.

The aircraft were modified with a long nose raiting that housed a Forward Looking Radar. Under the nose, a revolving ball turwer was installed which housed a Forward Looking Infrared sensor (FILR), a Low-Light-Level TV (LLLT) and a laser rangefinder. The aircraft was also fitted with an advanced navigational system and passive IR detectors.

Two rectangular aluminum weapons dispersers (for CBU bundles) were stacked within the fuselase. The container housed twelve cells each containing three Chintes (CBUs) (thirty-six total). Depending on the type of CBU installed, the containers had a capacity of between 2.664 and 6372 one round bonds. The bomblets were released through twelve openings in the corner for that aligned with the cells in the weapons disparer. The lower leakage contained twelve inward opening doors that aligned with the openings in the orange floor forming a guide. Bottlenet release was controlled by a weapons panel in the forward fuselase. In the event of an emergency, the entire load could be jettisoned manually.

To supply the electrical power needed to operate the sensors and armament system, the engine generators were replaced by alternators. To cool the alternators, air scoops were added to the top of each engine needle.

Prior to deploying to Vietnam, the two aircraft were sent to Osan Air Base, South Korea to be evaluated against the high speed infiltration boats used by North Korea to send agents into South Korea. The unit remained in Korea from 19 August 1968 until 23 October 1968, and were scheduled for a total of fifty-seven missions. Upon completion of their Korean assignment, the unit was deployed to South Vietnam for a combat evaluation of the Black Spot weapons system.

In South Vietnam the aircraft were operated under the project name and the project name and the social gas - Black Spot. Black Spot started began operations on 15 November 1968, flying from Plan Base Air Base, South Vietnam, with mission staging areas at Binn Thuy and Pleika. During the combat evaluation period (November 1968-January 1969) a total of sixty-nine services were flow. The meter areas consisted of thefacing Delta and the Ho Chi Chi Mini Mini Overlains. Aparting as armed night surveillance units, the two aircraft destroyed 151 boards/vehicles, damaged another IRS and need secondary explosions 26 targets.

The two aircraft completed seventy-seven percent of all missions and had an in-commission rate of eightty-four percent, not bad for an aircraft that was developed as a test bed and _new attitude to be said operationally_.

C-123T

In the mid-1960s, Fairchild made a proposal to the USAF to re-engine the entire fleet of C-123B aircraft with 3,420 ship Allison T56 turboprop engines. The intention was to use the experience gained with the YC-123H with its wide spaced main landing gear and auxiliary jet engines made with the proven turboprop power plants from the Lockheed C-138 assistant transport. This proposal would have given the C-123, with its airframe life (in 1960) estimated to at least another 20 years, -- a newlease on midfire. The USAR, however, had placed most of its available money in C-130 development and no contracts were forthcoming.

During the latter part of the U.S. involvement in South Vietnam, the USAF began turning over C-123B and C-123Ks to allier afores in the region. Thailand received a number of C-123B and C-123Ks along with one-123B (56-43T). The Royal Thai Air Force became aware early on that the supply of new and oped Fuel Part and Whitney Road radial engines have limited and began research project aimed at finding an alternate power plant for their fleet of using C-123B.

That project led to a contract being placed with the Mancro Aircraft Company of Paramount, California. Mancro, in cooperation with the USAF (which supported the project) the loan of engines, propellers and associated equipment, began a conversion of the C-123 to turboprop power.

The conversion did not end with simply replacing the Pratt and Whitney piston engines with turboprop Mission engines. The work included wetting the wing (turning the wing into a fuel tank, the installation of a gas turbine Auxiliary Power Unit (APU), installation of hydraulic boost units to provide power steering for the order, airfoan and elevators and bleed air was channeled from the engines to provide heat for the cockpit, energy compartment, wing leadges as well as potential and sterilized leading edges (to act as dicers).

The turboprop engines chosen for the project were 3,420 ship Allison T56-A7 turboprop engines driving four blade Hamilton Standard 56H0-91 propellers. Mancro intended to use the later Allison T56-A-15 engine once full scale conversions of the Thai C-123 fleet began.

Wetting the wing was necessary since installation of the turboprop engine made it necessary to remove the engine needle left tanks on the C-123B. This wing sease scaled and plumbed, becoming a fuel tank with a capacity of some 2,3200 gallos. far surpassing the C-123B's original capacity of 1,462 gallos. Empty weight rose to 32,500 pounds (C-123F) from 31,050 pounds (C-123B) while maximum takeoff weight remained at 60,000 pounds.

The first flight of the C-123T took place from the Compton, California airport on 24 October 1980. After initial flight tests the C-123T was down to the Dallas Naval Air Station, Dallas, Texas during November of 1980 for further tests. These tests revealed a rate of climb of 1,550 feet per minute (bettering the C-123B by 400 rpm), a service ceiling of 2,000 feet2,000 feet2 or 2,128B and a range of 2,737 watachi miles, far surpassing the C-123B which had a range of 1,470 miles.

When the C-123T made its first flight, it also made history. The C-123 airframe had now from four modes: glider, pure jet, piston and turboprop. No other airframe built has ever flow in these four modes.

During 1981, the Royal Thai Air Force was forced to withdraw from the project due to budgetary restrictions and, since no other air force flying the C-123B was interested in converting their fleet to turboprop power, the whole project was dropped by Mancro and the Thai Government. Of course, by 1981 most C-123 airframes were approaching a service life of some twenty-five years. Additionally, there were many new tactical transports on the market, so no further effort was made to convert the C-123.

After all tests were completed the C-123T was returned to the custody of the Royal Thai Air Force and the aircraft returned to Thailand.

**YC-134**

Under a USAF contract, the prototype Chase C-123B-CN (S2-1627) was modified by the Stroudori Aircraft Corporation during 1956 under the designation CY-134-A. The modification included the installation of a Boundary Layer Control (DC1-C) system for increased using lift, re-engine the aircraft with 3.300 bp flight Turbo Compound R3350-89A radial engines and replacing the properties with four blade thirteen feet, six inch Aeroproducts fully feathering constantly untils. The horizontal stabilizes were given end plates to aid in directional stability, the main landing gear was extensively modified with the addition of an extra set of wheels, giving the TC-134 a dual main landing gear (the dual isosewbone from the C-123B was retained). The first flight of the modified aircraft occurred on 19 December 1956 from Stroudoffs West Tennen, New Jersey facility.

The internal fuel capacity was increased by the addition of two rocenter section tanks in the wing, each with a total capacity of 1.0092s. Fuel was no longer carried in the rear of the engine micelles as in the earlier C-123B. 550 gallon under wing drop tanks could also be carried, bringing the total fuel capacity to some 3,300 gallons. This gave the YC-134 a range, with a 24,000 pound payload, of 1,600 miles.

**The prototype-VC-134 (S2-1627) closely resembled an early C-123B. The aircraft carried the Stroudori Aircraft embration on the nose and the BLC logo. The YC-134 was basically a modified version of the YC-123B BLC test aircraft with larger more powerful engines. (NASA)**
