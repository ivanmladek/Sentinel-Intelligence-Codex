## Introduction

Two major factors combined to bring about the development of the A-3 Skywarrior. The first was the advent of the jet engine and the second was the technology of nuclear weapons. With the development of the Atomic bomb and its tremendous destructive power, it was obvious to the military that nuclear weapons were here to stay. The Army Air Force Inc and the Boeing B-29 Superformers to deliver a nuclear pay load from land bases, and the U.S. Navy also wanted the capability to deliver such a load from its carrier wheel force. With the service introduction of the P2V-3C Neptune, the Navy acquired the capability they had sought, but with one severe limitation. The Lockheed Neptune could take off from a carrier deck with the help of JATO (Het Assisted Take Off). This was demonstrated during March of 1949. The problem was that such a mission would be a one-way trip from the carrier, since the Neptune lacked the capability of landing back aboard and had to reach a land base. The P2V-3C did, however, provide a turnover of the nuclearity needs of the Navy.

In February of 1951, the North American AJ-I Savage was introduced to the fleet and became the first operational nuclear carrier based bomber. It was fully carrier qualified and could launch and recover from the desiders of the carriers on a round-trip basis. The Savage was, at flat time, the target aircraft to be operationally assigned to the carriers and was quite a handful for the deck events to manage. The A-1 was a project combination by two pmt & Whitney, 2,400 hp R-2800-88 radial engines and two 4,600 hot Mism J-33A-10 water budget engines, giving it a top speed of 450 mph. For the Navy's nuclear needs, the AJ-1 superseded the P2V-3C, however, the Navy wanted an all-jet cluster number and the higher operational speeds that it could provide.

**The North American AJ-I Savage was the first nuclear attack aircraft operationally assigned to operate Qutto from Navy carrier decks. It was powered by two piston and two jet engines that gave the aircraft a top speed of 450 mph. This AJ-1 (BuNo 124181) was assigned to NATC Patavent River, Maryland during 1951. (Pete Bowers Collection)**

In the Navy's guest for such a bomber, no less than a dozen companies expressed an interest in bidding for the contract but, in the final analysis, it boiled down to Curtiss and Douglas, with Douglas presenting the best design (the model 593-8). Through the experienced guidance of Ed Henizainen, Douglas provided a lightweight but vastly concept that was initially scoffed at by the Navy, who thought that a nuclear attack bomber should weigh considerably more. Heiming forward brown andyne the first X3D-1 (BuNo 125412) was completed and from from Edmunds AFB on 28 October 1952.

As with any new aircraft, some design problems surfaced, but these were quickly resolved. In early light testing it quickly became apparent that the 7,000 lost Westinghouse 1-400 turbo jet engines were insufficient for the Big Skywarrior. With availability of the more powerful Pratt and Whitney J-57 turbo engines, that problem was resolved. Some design changes were necessitated by this larger engine, including the installation of a larger engine nucleic and stronger engineylon. Developing over 9,500 pounds of thrust at military power, the J-57 delivered sufficient power for the Skywarrior to meet its design intent. For a maximum load take-off or short field operation, twelve JATO bottles could be attached to provide extra thrust. These were installed on six attachments points located on both sides of the rear fuse-lage.

The prime design requirement for the Navy's largest jet was the capability to deliver a molar bomb load from the deck of an aircraft carrier. This concept was the Navy's answer to the USA's Strategic Air Command (SAC). In keeping with its nuclear delivery capability, the Skywarririar awse developed around a few five by five fly fifteen found bomb by which was large enough to hold the rather bulky and heavy 10,000 pound nuclear bomb. That requirement necessitated the vote of a high swept wing design, which proved to be ideal for the placement of the two engines. The installation of the resulting low-lating tin engine accelerates

**The X43D-1 (BuNo 125412) on the ramp at the Douglas factory in El Segundo, California during 1952. The prototype had tubular engine naceless housing Westinghouse 1-40 engines. All lettering was white on an overall Giossy Sea Blue finish while the forward portion of the engine naceless was trimmed in Red. (Douglas via Bruce Tombecky)**The first, of two, prototype Skywaritors, XA30-1 (Buflo 125412) in flight on 15 December 1952, during early factory flight testing had Westingtones 4-40 engines installed. These two soon replaced with the more powerful Pratt and Whitney \(\times\)5-7rupted engine. This airframe combined in various flight test programs until its retirement during mid-1956. (U8N via Robert F. Dorn) made access to the engines for maintenance much easier. The XA30-I had a pressurized cockpit crewed by three including the pilot with a single set of controls, a bombardier seated to the right of the pilot and a navigator, who was seated back-to-back with the pilot. The only defensive ammement carried by the Skywaritor was a tail-mounted, remotely controlled part of 20nm cannons with 500 rounds per gun. For compact storage aboard the carriers, the outer ring panels and vertical in new hydraululics folded. The high wing was swept back thirty-six degrees and incorporated leading edge slaks outboard of the engine neccles. These slats operated automatically by aerodynamic loads and provided extra lift for the wing. During its production life, only two basic versions have built, the A30-1 and A30-2. Douglas produced fifty of the A30-1 variant and 230 of the remote powerful A30-2s. As time and technology progressed, the Navy added more nuclear-capable aircraft to the fleet and the A-3 was pressed into other roles. It was modified for reconnaissance, electronic surveillance, trainer, tanker and VIP transport. A few airframes were also modified to serve as test beds for various missile and weapons systems and, as of this writing, are still flying in that capacity with private companies.

The original design for the Skywaritor had no provisions for ejection seats and even though the concept was seriously considered, none were ever fitted to the Navy's A-3s. Emergency escape was accomplished via an "escape chute" located on the bottom of the fuselage to the rear of the nose wheel compartment. The name "WHALE" was soon adopted for the A-3 because of its large size. On occasion, when coming over the carrier's frontal, it was called the "Aluminous Orrecal", since its shape shadow blocked out the sun s was it passed overhead. The performance of the NASA-1 Skywaritor was hosted by the USAF who immediately expressed an interest in the design for use as an attack bomber. USAF modifications were implemented and the result was a look-like cousin that was designated as the B-66 Destroyer. Quite similar in external appearance to the Skywaritor, the B-66 was powered by a pair of 10,000 lst Alison J71 turbojet engines. Even though the A-3 was the original airframe, the B-66 was produced in larger quantities than the Skywaritor, with a total of 294 Destroyer being manufactured against a total of 282 A-3s. The fibre life of the A-3s continued until the last one was retired in 1991, a period of thirty-nine years, compared to the retirement of the B-66 which occurred in 1974. Indeed the A-3 Skywaritor was a remarkable aircraft with a proud history of service with the U.S. Navy.

being located on the port and starboard sides. This JATO installation allowed the thirty-five ton "Whale" to date if in just four seconds, using less than the distance of a football field.

The Skywarter performed many varied missions, but its primary purpose was that of a nuclear attack bomber. Other assignments were: conventional high altitude bomber, low level attack and pathfinder navigational resort for other havy aircraft. On some occasions, the big Douglas jet was utilized as a high-speed jet animal vehicle between ship and shore.

Creued by three, the Skywarter had a couldn't make in excess of 1.000 national miles and a series ceiling of 40/00 feet. The bomb was capable of carrying a total of 87,000 pounds of bombs (nuclear or conventional) as well as mines and other special ord ord ordance.

The first 3AD-1 Skywarters were assigned and delivered to VAH-1 at NAS Jacksonville, Florida during March of 1956. The modes used on that squadron's aircraft was "TB" which was used to acknowledge the commande or in the unit, the well known and repeated Second World Warmer or the first Navy. F4U General combat squadron, FV-17, Captain Tommy Blackburn, The first operational assignment of the ASD-1 was in late 1956 aboard the USIS FORESTAL.

Although not factory installed on Skywarters in the production line, A3D-1s were soon retrofitted with twenty-four for deceleration/or branching matches to help produce the roll-out distance and based. The thirty-six degree work using had feeling edge dusts around the engine maccules which were automatically actuated by aerodynamic loads and improved the lifting efficiency of the wing, in addition to the natural ASD-1.00 hamster configuration.

Douglas converted one of the airframes (Bus No 13585), of the first production batch of fifty aircraft, to a photographic reconnaissance variant which was designated as the A3D-1PRA-3A. This modification was accomplished by installing a photographic kit in the bomb by, rendering it incapable of functioning as a bomber. Since it could no longer carry out its primary function, the aircraft was given the new designation A3D-1. In addition to the photo-graphic kit, camera ports were installed on each side of the fuselove, low and just forward of the bomb by. Carrying as many as twelve cameras, the A3D-1Pad provisions for dropping photo flash bombs outstrips for flight photographic missions.

**Positional on the port endpoint of USIS FORESTAL, an A3D-1 (Bus No 135408) burns up as another A3D-1 (Bus No 135411) prepares to launch during carrier suitability trials. The trials were from by Flight Test Skywarters from NATC, Pataxent River, Maryland on 4 April 1956. (USIN via Harold Andrews)**The only other variation of the original batch of fifty A3D-1s was the electronic reconnaissance version, the A3D-1QEA-3A. Five airframes were converted by Douglas (BaNo 130305 and Bus 13060-13063). These aircraft aircraft aircraft are of seven, four EXOperators and the standard light light cycle of three. The A3D-1Q was first from in May of 1955. The EM computers were responsible for gathering electronic intelligence information on enemy emitter sites. The A3D-1Q version resident ECM antennas in two fooling shelters located just to the rear and under the cockpit. A small ECM ventral "cause" was added to the forward underscript of the fooling. Those features made it easy to identify the A3D-10, some-interned testbeds to see the "Querar Whole" because of its external differences with the standard 3D-1 configuration.

As the next variant, the A3D-2/A3B entered production, starting in 1956, the A3D is faded to quickly quickly and were relegated to training assignments, special use missions or retired. The A3D-1 Skywarter was the Navy's first all-year attack banker and largest aircraft to be missed to operational carrier deployment. As the long service career of the A-3 unfolded, many more uses and designations would follow.

**(Righly Plying over the water off the southern coast of Maryland during December of 1956 this A3D-1 (BuNo 135431) was fitted with the more powerful PAW -4F turbojet engines. The aircraft was assigned to NATC and flew with the Navy until early 1966 when it was retired. (USN via Harold Andrews)**

This A3D-1Q (Bulho 130361) was the third alirtime converted to the electronic reconnaissance code. The Skywriter was on loan to Westhouse and the Army for testing their SLAIR (Side Looking Airborne Radar) pod similar to the one later installed on the DV4 Mohavri) during 1966. (Dave Luchaugh Collection)A3D-2/A-3B Skywarrior airframe was the final and definitive version produced by Douglas. The company built 164 3D-23, thirty ASD-22PM-A3B-s, twenty-four ASD-20/EA/A-3Bs and twelve ASD-277A-3Bs. All other variants were: Henderson/Conversions by Douglas andfor the Navy. The ASD-2 first flews on 12 June 1956 and featured a number of improvements over the earlier ASD-1. These improvements included the installation of the more powerful 10,500 light Part and Whitney 1/5-P-10 turbulent tubes. These engines were designed the A3D-2 a combat radius of 1,200 times and its appeal to speed of 558 hours. The bomb was was amplified to carry 12.800 pounds of marker or conventional bends, and as much as mines of other special purpose whence. The aircraft was also modified with a refueling probe mounted on the port fuselage side. The addition of the night refueling capability greatly expanded operating range of the ASD-2 and the latter adapt of a marker package, the Skywarrior was given a prolonged service life that lasted into the early 1990's. Other improvements included reliable anti-sidal brakes, pressureful crew cockpit and forward portion of the bomb by compartment and a heavier, stronger energy.

Although one early ASD-2s had the twin 20th slotar signaler installed on the production line, most were quickly removed in favor of the "dwe" system's identifier fading and the defensive ECU systems it housed. The ASD-2 also saw the first use of the "flat" case rendering the housed an A/N/B-87 radar. This time type of that reduced racmax was sufficient for an early tier Al3-1B that were still in service. The ASD-2 had a gross weight of 70,000 pounds.

The first batch of ASD-2s began to reach the next eight up 1997 and see assigned to VAMP. 2. Douglas continued to produce A3D-2 Skywarriors over a three year period with the final one being completed early in 1960. A grand total of 230 airframes were completed. Like its predecessor, the ASD-2 had folding outer wing panels and a folding vertical all, all hydrostatically operated, as were the exchible traalge speed brake. Although from the start the swept wing design had automatically actuated lasts outboard of the engine nucleus, an improvement was introduced with the cambered leading edge wing, which extended the slas from the inner side of the engine nectiles to the fuselage, which greatly improved the handling of the Skywarrior on take of and landing.

The twenty-four foot deceleration/a parraultic installation was included for use on short- or afterfields at smaller land bases. One former Whale-driver volunteered the following story. One very cold winter day, his A3-3 was to ferry some Naval types from the boat to two different loads. All wet well from take off and everything progressed normally including touchdown at the first base where the drag time was deployed and functioned as advertised. As the Skywarrior slowed down on the rainy, cold ramway, the pilot turned off the day unny onto the tasury and proceeded to the operations holding to discharge his passenger. The wet parchaute was kindly repeated and slowed in is compartment and the A-3 depart-ed for the second Naval Air Station. After a short investment flight, the A3D up for the duty many and immediately after a perfect touchdown deployed the drag time. To overcome a's amazment, a perfectly formed orange ice cube came unlung out of the ram compartment and logged along behind the A-3 for the length of the ramway. With no actual damage and noise and will more than a few stickers, the A-3 discharged its passenger is and departed post-huste. Coincidentally, a squadron memo was later issued to carry a spare, dyute for such encounters.

Another story related to the exploits of the While was submitted by a former prior who shall remain anonymous. He related the following narrow escape, it seems that during a hasty departure from the flight rock, this pilot rotator to lower its flaps during a hasty. In section 2 this implies, caught the oversight and the A-3 was positioned for the catruplet shut and is given the signal to launch. Then a third third third the subbar and placed. The steam end is high and as the Skywarrior accelerated down the deck, everything appeared normal. As the Whale became airborne, the pilot realized be did not have the usual fit and immediately discovered that he had not lowered his fly fly for all. He engaged them instantly as the A-3 began to settle toward the water. As the fringe path held and began to provide some additional fit, he assumed the water in the ropien attitude for what much have been the longest ten seconds in the world. Slowly, but surely, the A-3 began to climb and thankfully, Davey Jones did not claim the Whale that day (shades of Jimmy Doomille's b-25 take off from the USS HornNET on the Tokyo).

Many of the A3D-2/A-3B Skywarriors were modified from their original designations and served in one or more additional rocks before their service lives were completed. A-3s served the U.S. Navy up to and including the Gulf War in 1990. Quie an admitable record for an airframe conceived in the late 1940's, Douglas had valid reason for their profile in producing the veneratic A-3 Skywarrior.

**Decorated with a sharks month, this overall Glossy Sea Blue Skywarrior was the first off the production line (eventually 164 airframes) to carry the designations A3D-2 After the BOD changed the designation system in August of 1952, the A3D-2 became the A3D-3Bs. Although the A3D-2 had no prototype, this Skywarrior (Buito 130029) had test instrumentation installed in the nose. A small Douglas column was positioned just to the rear of the white '902' on the nose. (Ed Matinov via Clay Janssee)**This ADD-2 (BuNo 138965) was the fourth Skywarifor off the A3D-2 production line. It was soon redesignated as a YABC-2 and assigned to Sergee Test at the Naval Air Test Center, Patankar River, Maryland, to test stability and engine performance. The aircraft was visiting NAS Ancostica, on 25 October 1958. (Dave Lucchaugh)

## Refueling Capability

After trying several systems, Douglas prefected a real and those refueling system and introduced the tanker package to the fleet. The package allowed the standard A3D-2/A-3B to highlight reflect other aircraft, a capability much appreciated by aircraft low on fuel. This tanker-package could be installed or removed in three to four hours, allowing the Skywriter to serve as an aerial tanker or a bomber. The addition of the tanker-package did not affect the designation of the Skywriter, it remained A3D-2/A-3B. When the permanent inflight reflecting system was installed on Whales early in 1967, the designation of the dedicated tanker was changed to KA-3BThe XA3D-1 (BuNo 125412) prototype was powered by Westinghouse J-40 engines when it rolled out during 1952.

The EKA-3B version was a dual-purpose modification allowing the Skywarator to serve both as a tucker and a ECM aircraft. This version was utilized during the war in Vietnam and flew from carriers and land bases. Conversions to the EKA-3B configuration were handled by NARF Alameda who completed the modifications of thirty-nine airframes from A-3B and K-3B Skywaritors. Externally, the EKA-3B was easily identifiable by the four large teardrop-shaped fuselage blisters that housed much of the ECM equipment and the ventral "cano" located on the bottom of the fuselage. Although the EKA-3B had a dual-mission assignment it returned a crew of only three.

A3D-2G/EA-3B

Douglas manufactured twenty-four A3D-2QEA-3B Skyvariators, with the first flight taking place on 10 December 1958. The first Electr deliveries of this ECM/reconnaissance version of the White year to VQ1 in November of 1959. In addition to the standard flight crew of three, the A3D-2Q4 variant had provisions for four generators for the ECM missions. Operating from carriers for land bases, the primary mission of the A3D-2QEA-3B was to provide threat warnings of SAM site activity, while locating the origin of their emitters. Another mission was the collection of additional electronic signals and transmissions of interest to Fleet intelligence.

To provide for ease of entry or emergency exit, the EA-3B was fitted with a crew entry hitch on the starboard side of the fuselge near the wing leading edge. The seven man crew operated in an air-conditioned, pressurized environment which allowed them to perform their duties at any altitude without the cumbersome oxygen mask. This long range version of the Skysurator was powered by two P8W J-57 whuggles, had a top speed of 550 knots and had an operating range of more than 2,500 miles. As the ECM version of the Intrauder became available, the EA-3B8 were phased out of service.

Douglas manufactured thirty of the photo- reconnaissance A3D-2P/RA-3B Skywarters. First flown on 22 July 1958, this long-range jet photographic aircraft greatly expanded the eyes of the Fleet. Creved by four, the RA-3B carried up to twelve cameras for vertical and oblique photography. Exemplarily, the RA-3B could be easily recognised by the camera ports and flaring located to our own bots of the fuselge transfer of the bomby. Serving with only three quadrants (VAP-61, VAP-62 and VCP-63), these Skywarters could fly day or night missions. For night photography the RA-3B carried flash bennis of flash exitrides. While some early production photo Sisywarters initially carried the tail-mounted twin 20m4 camera installation, it was soon deleted in favor of the ECR type at lair. After their service in the reconnaissance role was completed, three airframes were modified to NRA-3B3 for use in missile system development work and others were reconfigured as ERA-3B3 for Fleet electronic warfte support.**

## ERA-3B

A total of ten RA-3B Skywaritors were modified by NARF Alameda to the ERA-3B configuration and served exclusively with two squadars, VAO-33 and VAO-34. These Whales were used for long-range reconnaissance and electronic surveillance and communications jamming. Equipped with chart disperses located in the tail, these Skywaritors were most effective in confusing enemy radar and superb in locating unfriendly emitters and targeting them for destruction. Because of their weight, ERA-3B operated only from hand bases. With underlying priors for ECM beds and RAT (Ram Air Turbine) installations on each side of the frostage, as well as the ventral fusselge mounted "cano", the ERA-3B was easily identifiable. This vision of the Skywaritor carried the normal flight crew of three plus two ECM evaluators.
