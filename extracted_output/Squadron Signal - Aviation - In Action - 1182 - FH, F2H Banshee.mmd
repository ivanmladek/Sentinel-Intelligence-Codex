## Introduction

During World War Two, a small number of aircraft companies were responsible for the design and production of the majority of the US aerial spectrum that eventually defeated the Axis powers. Manufactures such as Bell, Boqing, Lockheed, Republic, Douglas, Curtis, North America, and Grumanian accounted for the law's share of American earminer aircraft production. Other, least known aircraft manufacturers and volunteers do not build the major manufacturers' aircraft meet those issues. In addition to these companies, several other firms also tried to increase the military to variety of users in an attempt to gain a share of the huge expenditures those allowed for military aircraft procurement.

One such firm was McDonnell of St. Louis, Missouri, which had received a number of cross-track for sub-assembly work from the major manufacturers. Whitesep in the work, Whitesep in the work, who McDonnell engineers began working on their own design for a winning higher value of deployedly unconverational configuration. Deployment the **X-P4** Moonball, this design was actually the third third third of the McDonnell found one with in response to the Army Air Corps Research For Progressal R-40; which had been issued in 1940. Despite these limitations, the work on this issue, the work on this issue requires a possible design in order to close the gap between the US foreign designs. McDonnell's fast two enders, McDonnell 11, were never over to serious consideration, but reached in Army "seed money" that concerned McDonald to continue development. This resulted in a design, labeled Model III, which was submitted for Army consideration.

While the new design was intriguing, some Army officials were skeptical about being a relatively new company become involved in aircraft manufacturing in a fielded saturatedly with established firms. The Army fellow there was once of a need for subcontractors to supply the major companies with components other than adother firm to the pack.

James McDonnell, however, was a trailed businessman. He never that while subcontractors might rely on this during the war, but they also may soundly would be able to survive after the approaching conflict was over would be through its own indigenous designs. With that

**The first in a long time of McDonnell aircraft was the X-P4 floorboard, an attempt by McDonnell engineers to come up with an advanced design to break into the highly competitive lighter aircraft manufacturers' rnns. The Moonball was undoubtedly a starting departure from the classic fighter pattern of the time with its blended, sweeping lines and smooth skin. (IMC)**

in mind, McDonnell lobed intensively for his new designs in Washington and at the Army test facility at Wright Field near Dayton, Ohio, McDonnell's efforts were successful and he was able to continue many difficulty at the potential for his designs and of the company's ability to come through once the new aircraft was accepted for production.

With official holding, McDonnell and his design team went to work with a venguence. A member of changes, mostly regarding ammisters, were eventually made to the basic design following several conferences with Army officials during the latter year [94]. In the spring of 1942, a wooden mesh was added of the McDonnell layer. Amer and many other officials were invested with that year year. The familiar-hour wing gave the new XP-67 a smooth, steel appearance providing performance via beyond anything then in the air.

Now began on two prototypes, but McDonnell had his engineers faced one problem after another. While the X-P3-76 benchmark found extensive wind tunnel tests, it showed that the design had little tolerance to zero performance was to be maintained at the claimed time. Other is design problems related to cooling and handling cropped up, causing further changes in the objects. In disciplines in executing the new 1600 degree Computer Continuation: 1440-1705 engines and additional changes in the basic design due to new wind tunnel information to a constant revision of the prototype's ability. The results in the Army nearly canceling the whole project, however, McDonnell was at his end meeting's wall and overlapped these off-axis to keep the project alive. In part, McDonnell's basis for the confirmation of the X-P67 project was the advanced aerodynamic features incorporated into the design. These features had practical applications when tuned with the new jet emissions, which were just extending off the driving towards.

The X-P67 Moonball finally tried out of the McDonnell facility to December 1943 - over two years after the initial contract was signed. Ground tests were quickly initiated, but fires started in both engines during that tests were more safe about. The damage was fairly rapid easily repaired. The current was then transported to Scott Hill, Illinois, where the first flight flight took place on 6 January 1944. Being increasing problems the first test flight that only 15 minutes, but the X-P67 handed potentially during the flight. After some research, additional flights took place toward the end of the month, all of which confirmed

The X-P67 handed beautifully in the air, but was found to be underpowered. Additionally, there were cooling problems with the engines and during early test tests until fires broke out in each engine. These were quickly put out with little damage to the aircraft. The first test flight also had to be cut short due to overtaking problems after only 15 minutes in the air. (IMC)

## XF2D-1/XF2H-1 Banshee

Even as the new Phantom was in the process of being satisfied for its first flight, both Navy and McDombell officials were looking to the future. They were generally pleissed with the XF2D-1/XF1 flight but quickly realized that the fibers' range and speed could be improved. On 2 March 1945 - a tilt over one month after the Phantom's main flight - the Navy ordered a new prototype based on the XF2D-1 under the designation of **XF2D-1**. The Navy wanted an aircraft with a range, speed, altitude, and armament equal to or greater than those of US Air Force flights then in existence.

McDombell's initial response was to scale up the XF2D-1 with two Wissenhouse 134-W2-22 jet engines, each producing 2000 pounds of thrust - almost twice the power of the Phantom's 1600 pound thrust 330-W2-20. The ramament was also increased from four 50% either (12.700) machine was four 22th MSG cm. The weapons were moved from the upper nose to the lower nose to reduce the blinking effect of marzle flashes on the pilot. A small grazing radar was fed to the nose, but above the camera. The plan to simply use the basic MPB-1 design was quickly found to be unfeasible. While the ephemies returned the basic wing onto engine position, the remainder of the arithmetic became a totally new design, The larger engines required a new wing, whose span was increased from the Phantom's 40 feet 9 inches (12.63 x0) to 41 feet 6 inches (12.65 x0). Both the intake arrangement and the baseline were strengthened and dropped. A larger tail was added and the overall length of the aircraft was increased from 38 feet 9 inches (11.83) to 39 feet (11.93). The main landing gear retract-ofward rather than inward as the XF2D-1 and a kneeting nose gear was incorporated to allow the nose to be lowered to improve carrier storage. This feature was also found on North American's F2F1 Fury and allowed the tail to rise up and let aircraft be pushed closer together. The kneeting gear soon proved impractical in service and was discontinued.

On 11 January 1947, newly two years after the Naval Naval Aircraft, the first XF2D-1 prototype fleve on the McDombell facility at Lambert Field, Siel Louis and the wavefield's eyes of both Navy and canyon officials. McDombell test pilot Robert Dickinson, aiming in a new McDombell designed region scan, that the XF2D-1 just the waiting crowd and pushed the throble forward asThe new K2D-1 was much larger and more streamlined than the Phantom. The long tail fading was eventually reduced in size on the production Banshee. The PD-1â€™s recessed canopy arrangement gave way to a straight, bubble type on the K2D-1. The Archerts Bureau Number, or Bulto (9885), is with on the vertical tail, between RAVY and MCDONnellL. (MDC)

A unique feature on the K2D-1 and early production F2D-1s was a traveling nose gear, which allowed the tail to be elevated for closer storage onboard carriers. It could also be used in training to hide direct the exhaust gases away from the deck, plane handlers, and other aircraft. This gear consisted of two small wheels in the nose, which extended while the regular nose gear was retracted. Although a novel idea, it saw little actual usage and was discontinued on later models.

(Above) A factory fresh F2H2 is parsed outside the McDennell factory with its wings folded. The hydraulically folded wings reduced the wingman from 44 feet to 1 inches (13.7 x) to 18 feet 5 inches (5.6 x). This feature reduced the space needed for the careful and accurate flight and magnet decays. The folded wingman remained the same for all Bannest variables (HODE)

F2H-2B Banshee

In an effort to increase the Banshee's versatility, McDennell built 27 FB2-28 with streightened contigs. Designated FB2-28, this variant could carry to be 30000 samples (1360.8 xo) of conventional endurance under the fibouard using surfaces. Much of this additional express was devoted to carrying either a 1650 ground (748.4 xo) Mx or a 32300 ground (1465.1 xo) Mx /84 located nuclear weapon under the port using. The F2H-28 specifications were unchanged from the standard F2H-2.

The modified Banshees were practiced out to various Compatior Squadron (VC) and Test Sapature (VC) with osm both the East and West Coats. These quadrupes detached F2H-28s for subsequent assignment to various carriers. The pilots then conducted a regular series of tests with the new advantage, with the goal of developing new weapons delivery works. The F2H-28s have also used to determine the optimum focal consumption, which would enable Banshee pilots to get the greatest possible range from their aircraft. A wide variety of techniques were used to increase the Banshee's radius of action. These techniques included fliplist or or emising at high altitudes, using the jet stream, and single engine use at high altitudes to achieve a glider or englime effect. The information gained from these F2H-28s tests provided the Navy with valuable data for future operations and aircraft design.

**Two F2H-28s from VX-5 prepare to make a practice bomb run off the California coast in early 1953. Only 27 F2H-28s were built and they were assigned to a number of Compatior (VC) and Test (VC) aquotations, which provided databases as needed to the Patel. The nose has his white and the top tplas are apparently the same color. These specially modified Banshees could carry up to 3000 pounds (1360.8 xo) of external ordanance, including a tactical nuclear weapon. (USRN)**

Early in the Banshee's development, both Navy and McDennell engineers began looking into firing the aircraft with radar to provide the fleet with a viable night fighter. Differing views by each party as to how to arrange the radar and instrument slowed development. A compromise was eventually needed in the F2H-28s were assessed 33.6 inches (85.3 xo), which increased the fastest length for 42 feet 1.6 inches (13.1 xo). The stretched nose housed an ANAPS-19 radar unit looking through a small, rounded fiberglassnce. The floor 20th class common, originally arrayed access the nose, were rearranged to provide additional room. Two camera were mounted on each side of the nose, their nozzle ports breaking the fastage skin just behind the same as for the standard F2H-28. In a believed that the underlying bone and rocket carrying capability were detected from this variant. The new fighter suffered to degradation in performance as a result of the longer nose and radar unit. The low-all-wether fighter received the designation **F2H-28**.

The F2H-28 prototype aircraft (Buso 123300) first five on 3 February 1950, but production was limited to only 4 aircraft. One of these Banshees was lost after a crash during the test program, another was sent to the Naval Air Test Center (NATC), and the remaining 12 were assigned to VX-4.5 xo was short-speed Composite Squadron, whose aircraft were deployed to Aldiate Fleet carries as the needrone. One F2H-28 (Buso 123311) was eventually modified into the prototype for the **F2H-3**, which became the all-wether Fleet fighter during the early 1950s and succeeded the F2H-28m in squadron service.

The prototype F28-All (Rule 123300) made its first flight from St. Louis on a February 1950. It was not fitted with the 200 gallo winglet fault tanks, but these tanks were standard on production aircraft. The F28-N2 was now extracted 33.6 inches (85.2 au) to house the AN/AP5-19 radar set. The Barnberg's four Zoum cannot were rearranged to allow more room for the radar equipment. The guns were mounted above each other on both the port and starboard sides of the nose, rather than the F28-N2 staggered filling. (HDC)

F2H-2P Banshee

The F2H-2P baseline model and high altitude performance increased US Navy officials, who decided that the Banshee had great potential for further development as a fleet photo-reconimaxence platform. A standard production F2H-2 (Busk 12336) was modified into a prototype reconnaissance aircraft and first few 12 October 1950. The modifications made to this aircraft, designated F2H-2P, were the most extensive made to any F2H-2 airborne. The nose was completely redesigned both in length and shape. This increased the Banshee's overall length from 40 feet 2 inches (12.2 au) to 42 feet 5 inches (12.9 au). Up to six cameras could be mounted in the new nose. Remote controls in the cocktail under the pilot to rotate the cameras in either the vertical or liquid plane. Additionally, the camera panels were fitted with heating units to reduce the effects of frost and fogging down to temperatures of 30\({}^{\circ}\)Faltenich (6.2\({}^{\circ}\)Celsius).

Provisions were also included for night photography. Two spots, mounted under the wings onboard of the flaps, each contained 20 fast multiples. The camera's shorter was striped when the cartridge tilt up the target. The F2H-2P did not carry guns, with the pilot either relying on the Banshee's speed, altitude performance, or the accompanying fighter except to escape enemy tighters. In overall speed was reduced from 575 nm (925.3 km) to 529 nm (85.1 km). So, while its range and altitude performance was generally similar to that of the F2H-2P. Higher This was primarily due to the newer nose and the superior reduction resulting from the addition of the four 200km Galton and is much more sensitive. Other differences remained the same as for the F2H-2P.

F2H-2P production run from late 1950 until May of 1952. Apart from the provoyoy, 89 additional airmasses were required for use by Navy and Marine Corps reconnaissance speakers. The photo Banshee saw excessive service during the Korean War and remained in service as one of the Navy's primary reconnaissance aircraft until its retirement in 1960.

The Korean War

The F2H Bausbee was a relative increment to the Korean War, which began with North Korea's invasion of the South on 25 June 1950. The first unit to take the F2H-2 into consult was WF-172 and myself USSSE EXC-9), which arrived on caution with the Seventh Street in August of 1951. This situation was to de la Malicia and Malicia based cancer archives ranging priority for the new fishery. WF-172 carried out its first stripe on 23 August and carried out on an unusual mission twice drops later. The North Korean of Russia was near the North Korean/Sovict border and was an important supply and railroad terminal. Due to its close proximity to the Soviet Union, permission to both hand it has to come Washington. Permission was finally given, but the US Air Force (USA) 2-B-29s worked with the insico could not rely on F-86e Solar fighter second because of the extreme time. The Navy was asked to provide second and the Bausbee was assigned to provide to cover, due to his high latitude performance. Unfortunately, no intercepting MIG-15s showed up and the Navy pilots were unable to test their metaite against the enemy fighters. The mission went off without a hitch and no B-29s after the security were lost.

Once is initial out of the study based SESEX was completed in the full of 1951, the Bausbee did not return to Korean waters until one year later, when WF-17 arrived about USS KEARSAGE (CVA-33).

This included Grass Pilling, V-11* Commanding Officer, who was std down in his Banshne in January of 1983. (USR)

Higher performance figures soon replaced F2H-2s after the Korean War ended and many Banshnees were assigned to the Benshnees. This F2H-2 (0-312Buillo 12333) was assigned to V4-78 - one of the last units to operate this variant - and MS Coceans, Virginia. The aircraft trim is Light Blue (F815102) and white. (USR)F2H-3 Banshee

The radar-equipped F2H-2N Banshee was only produced in limited quality, but it served as the former for the next major variant of the Banshee family - the F2H3-3. The eleventh EPI-2N (Bulbo 12331) was modified to a prototype for the F2H-3 series. This was the only prototype produced before the start of production. The new aircraft was a major redesign of the basic F2H-3 carried out experience gained from the Korean War. Additionally, the F2H3-3 was designed for the onset as an end-regular fighter. The fuseluge was lenghled eight feet (24 \(\times\) 10) house a new finginging AN/F04-41 radar, two Westinghouse J34-W3-36 nightsroads at 3205 points of fronts, and provide a 50% increase in the inertial level. Geuplex front (from the F2H-3 reheat, but never versions of the weapons - IdS 2) or MR-1s - were employed and the amminution capacity was increased to 220 mm outputs in the power and 250 rounds in the lower gap. Due to the larger radar, the gas were moved further back along the fuseluge to alleviate the crowded conditions that existed in the nose of the F2H-2N. The tail surfaces were also redesigned and the control surfaces were relocated from the full to the fuseluge and moved further at.

The new F2H-3 carried a slightly heavier wave travel ordinface J34- indicating nuclear weapons mobility - than the earlier F2H-2. During the 1995, the F2H3-3 was modified to carry the new AIM-95 "Steinerized" air-to-air missile, which provided increased effusive capability. To further increase the Banshee's range, a blob-in reigniting kit was designed for missions significantly modified. Any bunshealed, the refurbing probe replaced the super 2004 sannon on the world. Fuel was transferred from the probe to aphe then under the finging in a special housing to the center fuselues for tanks. The material refueling probe could be removed and the missing common replaced, when not needed. The F2H-3 could also be fired with 170 gdion (643.5), 51ying tanks, but there were often lost.

The Navy requested the new F2H-3 in any 1950 and the modified F2H-2N was extensive.

Iye tested prior to the start of production in the 1951. By then, an analysis of the F2H-3 was carried out.

and the lessons of the Korean War that been completed. The first flight of a production F2H-3 took place from Lambert Field, Missouri on 29 March 1952. The Navy knew the new fighter would be a winner from the start.

While some two tests heavier than the F2H-2 when fully loaded, the F2H-3 did not suffer an overall decline in performance. Maximum speed at sea level was slightly increased, but there was a 40 mph decrease in cruise speed. The service ceiling rose by 1,800 feet and the maximum mass was increased by almost 250 miles. Coupled with the all-waller capability of the new model, the F2H-3 gave the Navy a parent weapons system for its carrier fleet.

The F2H-3 was not without its developmental problems; probably the most serious of which was still flatter. After a series of tests using the K2D-1 prototype, the engines found a relatively simple solution to the problem. A case-degree three was not been broken in the fuseluge to a point mixup of the leading edge of the ultimate. The house was first order with west albed minimum to smooth the airflow and calibrate the flutter. While this solution was being applied, production began in earnest at the McDommel plant during the spring of 1952. McDommel proposed 250 F2H-3 by the time the time elapsed on 30 October 1953.

Also from its role as the first five Navy and Marine Corps all-weather fighter, the F2H-3 was also the first two and only fingler to be deployed on the Royal Canality Navy (RCN). The first post record of 392.6A-five to one third were another carrier, HMCS BONANYERERER, in the late 1950s. The F2H-3 Banshee was also the first McDommel insert to be purchased by a foreign government. These aircraft were not modified for aerial retibling. The F2H-3 was also the last ten years in the Bounce to be produced by McDommel. The later F2H-3 was also the last ten years in the Bounce to be produced by McDommel. The later F2H-3 was not photoiation after the F2H-3, but its production run ended while the F2H-3 was not photoiation earlier and the F2H-3.

producing continued.

The F2H-3 did not arrive into fleet service in time to see operations in the Korean War, but now worldwide service of the US Navy carries throughout the 1950s. The Banshee was gradually by enlarged by weaker agents (such as McDommel)'s own F2H Company coming of the drawing boards. The F2H-3 was gradually assigned to the Navy and Marine Corps Reserve Standards and calibrated in a this role until the law air

Some aircraft were also retrieved to carry the new ANAP-6 Sidewinder just coming into the inventory, (MDO)**

During flight tests, it was discovered that there was a minor tail father problem. The straightly easy solution was to fit a brace from the fuselose to the vertical stabilizer's leading edge. The brace was fitted over with sheet metal and it ended the problem. The triangular browser extension is easily distinguished by the different tones of the metal. (MDO)

## F2H-4 Banshee

The final Banshee variant was the F2H-4, which was externally identical to the previous F2H-3. The major internal changes included aprated 3600 pound thrust Westinghouse J34-WE-38 turboet engines and a new Westinghouse AN/APO-37 radar. The more powerful engines were the F2H-4 a maximum speed of 610 au/m (81.7800 s/m) - 30914 (83.3000 faster at sea level than the F2H-3. The 1.3 hour and 1.4 hour) are expensive of 50,000 feet (17.0680 s/m) - nearly two miles (23.2000 higher than the previous Banshee, the F2H-4* maximum range was also increased (2000 miles (2128.680 s/m)) approximately 300 miles (4828.800 greater than the F2H-3* range, while the combat radius slightly increased.

The AN/APO-37 radar offered from the F2H-3* Banshee A/APO-41 in that it used the older flight style double of several sub-daily World War Two. The AN/APO-41 used a steering circle and soft screen. Most losses seemed to prefer the AN/APO-41, since it was easier to acquire and follow a target. Like the F2H-3* the F2H-4 also suffered from a tail flutter problem, the same procedure was used to correct it - a 45 whose linear width went to form a 'horst' extension.

The US Navy and Marine Corps eventually took delivery of 151 F2H-4s from McDomell, F2H-4 production was actually completed in September of 1953, prior to the delivery of the last F2H-3. This was due to the greater number of F2H-3s under construction.

The F2H-4 Banshee provided the Navy and Marines with an all-weather fighter that served into the early 1950s, it was the only air-userbeam version from by the Marines, although some Marine Shields didn run on the F2H-3 in the Reverse. Three Marines eventually few the aircraft's maximum speed, altitude, and range over the F2H-3s. (HDC)
