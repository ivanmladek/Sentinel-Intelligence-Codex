## Introduction

During the Second World War the U.S. Marine Corps developed the most effective air-ground support team then in existence based upon the pioneer work the avistors had done in the Central American region during the 1920s and 1930s. This team refined those air-ground support to such an extent that Marines on the ground were able to call in air strikes within incredibly short distances to their past forward troops, helping to reduce casualties against the gramatically dug-in Japanese defenders on numerous islands on the road to Tokyo. Similar tactics were also developed by the Army Air Force in Europe and while differences existed between the two services, a common handed which each shared us with the use of light signale angined aircraft to locate targets and affect aircraft attacks against these targets. These light aircraft were a vital link in effectively using air power to facilitate the advance of ground forces, and without them the effectiveness of air power in this role would have been severely handicepped.

Following the end of the war, the Marines continued to work on these tactics, the only service to do so, and this work proved invaluable in the Summer 1950 when the Korean War broke out. In the early days of the war, air support was the key weapon in holding back the North Korean Army from overwhelming U.S, and South Korean ground forces. The war Force, while providing vital support, had not worked on ice air-ground support to the extent the Marines had done since the end of the Second World War, and needed to hone its skills in this role. It eventually developed an effective structure to provide support to the ground forces.

Again the common thread that ran through both the Marine and Air Force tactics was the use of light aircraft to spot targets and direct air strikes. As driver of aircraft, including the Stinson L-4s and L-5s, Cessina O-1s and North American LT-6s were used in this role, although they had not been specifically designed for this role. Following the end of the war, This factory mock-up of the O-VIOA **reuss some** of the original features of the design which were later deleted on the production aircraft. These included the shorter wing and the horizonically mounted fuselage sponsons. **MAVA Airspeed**

the lessons of the war were studied regarding the use of air power to support ground forces, but little was forthcoming regarding new equipment.

In 1959, the Marines conducted a study concerning a new aircraft which could serve as both an observation and light attack aircraft. This study, designated LLVM data (H.D., Light Marine Attack Aircraft), aimed at developing a relatively cheap aircraft which could operate from forward airfields with a minimum of maintenance and facilities. A key proposal in this study was the ability of the aircraft to carry a variety of ordinance to support Marine helicories during air assaults. This requirement was unique at the time, since aircraft led spotting and control had never been called on to provide target support before.

While this study was under consideration, the U.S. began to realize that rather than all out nuclear or conventional warfare on a global scale, the most serious threat to the U.S. and allies was low-level intensity generalling was, which were being conducted in a number of areas, most notable in the former French of Ladas of Laura Ventarian in Southeast Asia. In line with the re-thinking of U.S. strategic goals, the Air Force began visiting interest in a relatively cheap aircraft aircraft which could be used in such a conflict in place of more sophisticated and expensive jet aircraft which were not suited for such conflicts. In addition, such an aircraft could be also be supplied to nations under the Military Assistance Program (MAP), many of which had only limited maintenance and support facilities.

At the same time, the Army was also looking for a new aircraft to replace its Grammanov O-VIOA. This aircraft would be used to support the concept of Almability that under development. The Army armed an aircraft that could carry a relatively heavy armament at fairly high speeds to provide flexible support during atmight operations.

The broad similarities in requirements fit right in with the new Secretary of Defense, Robert McNamara, and his concept of "commonly," by which one weapons system would be able to fill a number of fuels for all services, rather than having different aircraft under zone for The first prototype took to the air on its 4 July 1968 from the **Mortin American** plant of Columbus, Ohio under the control of their test light Ed Elloseye. The aircraft carried the Tri-Service marginals which were used on the aircraft within it was evaluated by pilots from the Army, Navy, Air Force and Marines. The aircraft carries a special test probe on the winding and does not have the fuselage sponsons fitted, **MAVA Airspeed**each service. It was envisioned that this would cut down on overall cost and duplication of effort. With this in mind, he formed a Ti Service Committee, comprised of representatives from the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps and Defense Department during early 1963 to form female requirements for one aircraft which would be able to fulfill the needs of each service with only minor modifications to the basic design.

The end result of this was a requirement for a Light Armed Reconnaissance Aircraft (LARA) which was formulated by the end of 1963. These requirements were sent out to various aircraft companies, who were asked to prepare proposals for the new aircraft within the parameters of the committers requirements, which were quite stringent: The requirements led for a given signal aircraft with a two new carve, capable of carrying a 24,000 points of ordinance, able to operate of small unpowered airstrips, and loper over a target fifty times from its base or come hour. In addition, it would have to be able to carry upwards of 2000 pounds of cargo, six juntruppers, or several rounded troops, or stechers, in its baseline. In general terms of performance, the aircraft was expected to be able to take stress loads of between plus 8 cms and millions 3G, operate from aircraft centers, by one engine, have a speed of least 300 mph, while to be able to converted to an amphibax and have no cost for talent.

Ammarent was specified as four 7.62km machine passing with 20,000 rounds of amminmin.

Haptupsets were to be provided for a variety of different outcome, including Skokawider air-to-air missiles (AAMs) and the ability to carry a 20km gun pod.

In response to the committees invitation, eleven companies submitted proposals and from these, seven were chosen for closer examination. These were the Bech PD 183, Douglas D.855, General Dynamics/Control Model A35, Chapter 1632, Lockheed C.T66, Martin and the North American Rockwell N. 300. After a detailed examination of computer study of each proposal, the Ti Serie Committee selected the North American design over the others in August of 1964. In October the company received a contract for seven prototypes. Several of the firms involved in the bidding protested this selection, but only General Dynamics/Control decided to build a prototype to compete against the NA-300 in the hopes of winning a "tly-off" competition. Despite this effort, however, the Defense Department did not change its mind and the decision to give the contract to North American was not changed.

**One of the VO-10s on display at an open house at the Eigh Air Force Base complex during an All Commentation presentation. At this time the increasing tempo of the new in Vietnam placed added emphasis on counter-insupery warfare which the Air Commandes were developed to handle. The Bronco design had been formulated with this type of warfare in mind. (Bokansalvi No Derby)**

Work on the aircraft, now designated the YOY-10A, went smoothly and on 16 July 1963, the aircraft made its first flight, only nine months, almost to the day, from contract approval, the basic design was a twin-bonomed configuration with the fuselago postponed under the wing with the pilot and observer seated in tandem under a large, segmented canopy which made for excellent visibility. To avoid undude complications or problems, the aircraft was of conventional aluminum mooseose construction. Power was provided by two 600 ship carrier ARResearch T76-668 prototype engines with each engine turbine it is propeller in the opposite direction in order to cancel out torque. These propellers were also reversible in pitch to aid in short short fiber operations. This was tied into the close legs of the landing gear by means of a sickness switch to forestall its use until the aircraft was firmly on the runway. To help increase alcou control in internal movement, four quarter circular plates were incorporated each upper wing which rotated upward with alcrooment, giving the aircraft a very end rate of roll with light light switch movement.

Following the initial test flight, the remaining six prototypes were delivered through 7 October 1966, During the period the various aircraft were put through a vigorous test program, both by Northern American and pilots from full air services. In addition, information from combat reports of Southeast Asia was also factored in, resulting in some serious changes in the criteria for the VO-10. These included the addition of more communications equipment, self-ealing fuel tanks, 300 pounds of amre protection from small arms fire, and the ability to operate in a high head/imability environment. As a result, the aircraft design could to be more important the specifications, resulting in major modifications to the basic design. The most noticeable was the increase of the suspension by some one feet and the movement toward of the engine a model would be missiles. More power was needed and modified versions of the 715 ship T76-610/12 engine was fitted in place of the original T76-668 engine. The horizontal freugene response sponsors were applied downward to increase the probability of a "clean" volume separation. All these changes look into incorporate into the design and evaluate and correct for problems. Problems with lateral stability in both the original and modified design were discovered which led to the addition of a dorsal file at the base of each vertical fin. The various bugs; however, were wrong out by early 1968 and the aircraft was cleared for production under the designation OV-10A Bronco.

The sixth prototype shows of the classic lines of the Bronco design as it bends to the stubrow. The basic outline of the production aircraft would change very little from the prototype except for the length of the wing, the angle of the sponsons and the addition of a filter at the base of the tail assembly. (VAVA Alteweg)**

## OV-10A Bronco

While the prototype and early production models of the OV-10 were outwardly similar, there were significant differences between the two aircraft. Various changes had been made to the basic design due to new requirements and battlefield information. These changes resulted in a network of the airframe. While the fuselage shape remained basically the same, internally additional armor protection was provided for the crew, more communications equipment was added and the sponsons were angled downward. The most noticeable change was in the wing, which had been increased in sign by ten feet over the original prototype and the movement of the engine booms by some six inches. More powerful engines had been fitted, although these were modified to fit into the existing engine boils so that the nacks would not have to be lenghtened. Internally, self-sailing fuel rules were installed to leest the chances of fire or erosion from ground fire.

The end result of this was a unique aircraft, both visually and in performance. It differed from all other aircraft in the inventories of the U.S. forces. The high wing allowed both the freshape and engine nuclei to be close to the ground, making access to the various components for easier maintenance personnel. The placement of the wing also allowed for exceptional visibility for the two mm entrance. Seated in tandem under a large, bluhous company, both the pilot and observer had an excellent view toward the front and downwash, making surele acquisition and spotting much easier than in older type aircraft. Entry into the cockpit was made through large individual upward opening glass panels in the starboard side of each crew position. The panels on the port side also opened and could be used in an emergency. In the event of an inflight emergency, each crew can eject using his LW-3B zero-speed, zero-altitude ejection walk. The observer can initiate his own operation, the pilot can command eject both himself and the observer, a time delay feature jumps that the observer gets first. Both ejection seats are identical except for the recovery time location. The observer's seat has the editor on the starboard side and the pilot's seals has it located on the end side. This arrangement pulls the seat outward from each other to preclude a possible collision between the two seats.

The general arrangement of the cockpit was designed to provide service commands for all users, who doe to certain industries of each service as no means feat. Although each of the two main service users, the Air Force and Navy/Martine Corps have some differences in cockpit equipment, the general arrangements are quite similar. Perhaps the biggest difference is between the various types of communications, identification and navigation systems which are used by each service.

Behind the cockpit is a large cargo compartment which can be configured for a number of different missions. It has a total cargo area of 10 (cubic feet and can carry up to 3,200 pounds of cargo. Thanks to the high boom design of the OV-10 the cargo compartment floor is waist high, making it easy to load and unload. Besides cargo, personnel can also be carried. When rigged as a room carrier, other six industry or five motorometers can fit into the compartment, although it is rather close. In a medical evacuation code, a model and two literator offer for walking wounded can be flow out of the forward area for quick medical treatment. The large cargo compartment can also be used for additional avionics, communications or electronic gear. It can also be configured to carry amminution for special mini-gun turrets and their associated gear which have been tested on the Bronco.

When the engine nacelles were moved six inches outward, this helped to reduce the engine noise and propeller vibration in the rear cockpit. Due to the change in the initial specification, more powerful engines were needed on the production OV-10A and Garnett-Affesearch TF-G-1012 turbopos were fitted. To eliminate torque, each engine turned in opposite directions (the starboard engine is the -10 and the port engine is the -12). Each engine produced some 715 ship, an increase of 53 ship over the original TF-63-68 engines used on the prototype.

Since the Bronco was to be capable of operation from rough fields, the tricycle landing gear was designed to handle high sink rates when landing and no withstand rough terrain. The main gear was designed around a double telescoping olo which could withstand a sink rate of up to twenty feet per second. Hydroically operated, the main gear retracted toward the rear of the needle while the nose gear retracted forward. The retraction cycle takes about ten seconds, while gear extension is slightly faster at seven seconds. The nose wheel is steerable to fifty-five degrees left/off center. allowing for relatively any maneuvering while taxiing.

The nacelles taper down toward the rear of the boom and flare into a pair of vertical finstrostroides with a safety reference warped. On the top is a constant cost roboland stabilizer/teeut which runs between the two rooms, ending at a helmet shot of each fin.

Indeed in the center (above and below) of the tailing area was balance weights.

Unlike previous observation aircraft, the Bronco was specifically designed to carry a wide variety of ordinance on its seven external stress stations. In addition, it also carried four 7G/280th mobile guns, two in each side of the sponsons with 500 pounds of ammonium per 70. No implementing thisroy, additional gain posts can be carried on the haplotyn, up to the 3A 2000 plant.

Various types of bombs can be carried on the five sponsons and fuselage stations up to 500 pounds, while the centerline station can carry up to 1,000 pounds. They can all carry standard rocket pack except the centerline station. The two wing stations are wired to carry and fire the 3A/5 Survivator air-to-air missile and also carry standard rocket beds. The centerline station is also plumbed to carry up to a 230 gallon external fuel tank to give the Bronco **There was very little difference in general configuration between the OV-10 prototypes** and the OV-10A, which first came out in February of 1968, the longer wing span and downward angle of the tausle sponsons were the most visible differences. Additionally, there was a small inlet added to the base of the vertical to improve later-af stability, although the first ten aircraft off the production line had to be retrofitted with buses. (MA via Aliveop)Due to its high wing configuration the OV-10 was easy to maintain and service. The engines and ordance points were within the reach of the average mechanic or ground personnel and little in the way of specialized support equipment was needed as the aircraft had been designed to live in the field with the troops. (NA via Altevog)

This versatility in ordance capabilities gave the OV-10A tremendous flexibility and allowed the aircraft to be hullired for any number of control roles, from observation to strike. Combined with its speed, maneuverability, large and short field performance, the Bronco was ideally suited for use in the war which was going in Vietnam. The final production models began to roll off the Columbus, Ohio simply lie in February of 1988 and within five months, the Bronco would be taken into combat in Southeast Asia.

Visibility from the cockly was excellent when the high wing did not block downward observation, an important requirement for a FAC aircraft. The large bulbous canopy allowed the pilot and observer at-found toward visibility with little tobagles from the canopy supports. This crew is working with a pair of a-10s when the sea at the left, during an exercise in Korea. (USAF)The canopy panels on the port side of the aircraft could also be opened but these were used mainly as a means of letting air into the cocktail while the aircraft was taking or waiting on the runway since the large canopy heated by very quickly and the person was not equipped with air conditioning. In an emergency these could also be used to escape from the aircraft, but normally entry or exit was done through the starboard side. (WA via Altevog)

In case of trouble the pilot and observer could eject using their LW-38 zero-speedfrac attitude ejection seats. The observer can eject on this own, while the pilot can command eject both of them with this "D" ring. When this occurs each seat is thrown opposite each other to avoid entanglement or collision. In addition a time delay further insures a clean escape. (Stewart)The pilot was equipped with a illuminated reflector, non-computing optical sight for ordinance delivery. The split reticle could be depressed to 20 m/m. By tilting the reticle-ing glass the pilot can obtain the proper sight angle for proper release start range or lead angles for at types of ordinance. (Note Waters)

(right) The compartment was a pilot fit but could carry up to 3,200 pounds of cargo or six troops. Paratroopers could be dropped, although only five could be carried due to their paratroites. For medical evacuation, four walking wounded or two litters and a middle could be carried (Stewart)

A unique feature of the Henonve was its large cargo compartment located behind the cockpit. This could be used for carrying cargo, troops or wounded personnel. It could also be used for carrying additional communications equipment or special arrangements packages. Its low level to the ground made for easy leading and unloading. (Weako)Since the OV-10 was designed to operate out of forward, unrepeard disrupts its landing gear had to be able to withstand a tremendous amount of punishment. The double telescoping landing gear was designed to withstand a sink rate of twenty feet per second and this allowed the aircraft to operate out of extremely rough conditions. (Lund)

To help improve lateral performance the Bronco was fitted with spoilers to help improve an electron control. These spoilers were geared to the alternos manually and move through a range between 9 and 89 degrees. This combination gave the OV-10 an outstanding role at with very little force applied to the stick. (Mesko)One obvious change from the prototype to the O-V104 was the way the fuselage sponsons were made downward (the prototype’s were parallel to the ground). Each sponsons was equipped with two 7.62kms machine guns that were similar to the standard M80 machine gun used by ground forces. Designated M80Cs, each gun had 500 rounds of ammunition in the sponson weapons bay. (Elevent)

Weapons combinations, such as these four shot 5 inch Zuni rocket launches and seven shot 2.75 inch rocket pods could be tailored to the particular needs of a mission. (Love)

## OV-10 Pave Nail

Following the initial deployment of the OV-10A to South Vietnam, the Air Force became interested in improving the aircraft's ability to operate at night and in poor weather and to be able to direct more precise air strikes. During 1970, LTV Electrosystems modified fifteen Broncos to a special configuration designated OV-10A Pave Nail. This modification involved adding a stabilized night perspective sign, a combination laser rangefinder and target luminance, a LORNA navigation receiver and a laser Siegler IORA coordinate. This combination, called Pave Spot, allowed the aircraft to illuminate a target with a laser beam, or permitted an accompanying aircraft to use an offset vector to attack a target. A special pool was fitted under the raw cocklet and was operated by a weapons system operator. This system was used in the latter days of the Vietnam conflict, providing particularly useful when helping to locate downed pilots during Search and Rescue (SAR) missions. Operated by the 23rd Tactical Air Support Squadron (TASS) the aircraft were often employed as pairs, one ship to direct incoming strike aircraft and one down low to designate targets with its laser beam and maintain close surveillance of the battlefield. Following the end of the war, the surviving aircraft were converted back to standard OV-10A configuration.

The Pave Nail Broncos was an attempt by the Air Force to allow the aircraft to operate more effectively at night or in bad weather. These aircraft were easy to identify by the special laser designated pool located under the observers position which was used to designate a target. **Filteen OV-10A Pave** modified the task configuration and were used in the later stages of the Vietnam War by the 23rd TASS: (USAP).

## 90v-10b

The OV-10B was basically an OV-10A which was manufactured for West Germany as a target towing aircraft. The OV-10B carried no armament and had the sponsons and underghwing hardpoints removed. The targets were carried in a pool below the fuselage which could be controlled by a wind operator in the rear of the fuselage. This necessitated a clear field of vision and a transparent cone replaced the rear cargo hold door. The observer's seat and relative equipment was also deleted since no observer was carried on these missions.

The OV-10B20 was the same basic aircraft fitted with a General Electric 185-GE-4 turbojet engine in a special needle mounted above the fuselage center section behind the cockpit. This increased the normal speed of the Broccubo 100 mph. In addition to the speed increase, the 2.950 lst turbojet also tried the rear of climb and cut in half the take-off run.

The West German government ordered six OV-10Bs and twelve OV-10B(Zs). The first vo-10B flow in April of 1970, followed in September by the BQJ variant. The German firm of Relin-Fuggenbaum handled all but one of the conversions, but evidence indicates that the jet body was only used for any length of time on a single aircraft. Operated by Deutsch Lathfurt Farlangstreen, a civil target towing company, the OV-10B and OV-10B(Zs) flow out of Lectbeck where they replaced the Hawker Sea Furies in this role. These target towing Broncos operated for two decades, but age and the difficulty in obtaining spare paths finally led to their withdrawal during the early 1990s. They were replaced by Pilatus PC-9s.

The West German government decided to purchase a small number of Bronces for use as target tugs. These arrest arrest were modified by having their arrangement and sponsons removed and routing gear added. In addition, the rear cargo hatch was replaced with a clear dome so that the operator could have a clear view of the toward target. Although carrying German Air Force markings on the fuselage, the aircraft were operated by a civilian contract from. (Love)

To give the OV-10 additional power, a special jet pad was developed which was fitted to the center wing section behind the cockpit. Designated OV-100B (this variant was developed by North American in conjunction with the German form of Heni-Fuguggenau. Although at least one aircraft few in this configuration, it is believed problems with the jet pad resulted in very limited use of this system. (NA via MIT(Barte))

## 6 OV-10d

Although satisfied with the OV-10A's initial service in Vietnam, the Marine Corps wanted to develop a relatively cheap input interdiction aircraft to help spot NNx and VC troops and supply movements under the cover of darkness. After soliiting proposals, the Marines selected the one submitted by North American Rockwell in conjunction with LTV for the conversion of two aircraft for this note. Two OV-10A were modified with the addition of A-17-92nd Bain turter under the rearstage and a Forward Looking Infrared (FLIR) turter in the nose. To accommodate these changes, the sponsons were removed from the sides of the fuselage and the nose was extended thirty inches. Designated the YOV-10N Night Observation Gushyn Systems (NOGS), the Bronco proved ideal for such conversion. Its large capture compartment provided ample space for the communication and related equipment for the gun system and the underlaying stations were modified to accept external fuel tanks, providing for additional time-over-target.

The two aircraft were turned over to the Marines during 1970 and blown to the Naval Sweeps Center at China Lake, California, where they were fitted with their armament and operational equipment. After undergoing tests which proved successful, it was decided to test the two aircraft under combat conditions in Vietnam. Attached to Light Attack Squadron Four (VAL-4) Black Ponies, at Binth Thay, the two Broncos were used for a variety of missions during the period of June through 13 August 1971. Over two hundred missions were flown and nearly 300 enemy troops were credited to the two aircraft. In addition, on two occasions, the Marine Broncos were instrumental in saving beleagered outpots from being in an attempt to improve the ability of the Bronco to operate in the night interdiction role, the Marine Corps tested two aircraft which North American in conjunction with LTV had modified for the night interdiction role. Designated the YOV-100 Night Observation Gushyn System (NOGS) these aircraft featured an extended nose with a Forward Looking Infrared (FLIR) turter and a 200am counarm turned under the fuselage. These were deployed to Vietnam and operated with the Navy Bronco Squadron, VAL-4, in the Melong Delta region. On their return to the US, for further evaluation, one of them was assigned to the Navy test facility at China Lake and carried Navy markings. The original FLIR turter shape was modified on production OV-10Ons (Love)overrun by communist troops. During this test period, minor bugs were discovered in the system, but overall the Mairna were very pleaned with the test results. The FLIR worked well in discovering enemy troops at night and the 20th00 cannot provided the aircraft with a lethal punch. When operations were terminated in mid-August, the aircraft were returned to the U.s. for further testing.

The Marine Corps, although generally satisfied the month tests, yet out to improve the VOV-100 concept, found to be under-powered, the aircraft was upgraded with 1,004 Mbg Garnet T76-G-240241 engines driving problems made from composite materials. The set-over system was changed to the Texas Instruments AN/A-37 FLIR with NRF (Laser Rangfinder Designor). With the majority of the FLIR system's construction model the cargo by door, the run-drop mission capability was no longer possible. The gun turret, while it had worked very well in combat text, would not be installed due to program budget limitations. Instead, the original spouse armament was retained and the fencing modified to accept the gun turret, it was ever funded. The Sidewater missile wing protons were replaced with new/pions which could carry external funds well as we arrive at ordinary entrance. Either by design or error, the original flower capability was lost when the associated wiring was not extended in the new phones. The gross weight of the OV-100 bus now 14,400 pounds.

The program was approved during 1978 to convert a total of eighteen OV-10As to the newly designated OV-100 NOS (Night Observation System) configuration. Delivery of the OV-100 began in late 1979 with eight eight kentent being assigned to VMO-10 (ACAS New River, North Carolina) and into the VMO-201 (ACAS Camp Denification, California), one aircraft was retained by North American Rockwell for the testing of defensive countermeasures systems. The reserve squadron, VMO-4 (NAS Allature, Georgia) was equipped solely with OV-10As. The OV-100 bus are delivered with infrared (RD) suppressive exhaust stacks and a new IR suppressive Green plant scheme. All remaining OV-10As were eventually repaired in this new paint, but none were retrofitted with the new exhausts.

**Eventually the Mairna's decided to have eighteen OV-10As modified to the OV-100 NOS configuration by North American. This OV-100 is on the North American ramp on display after its initial acceptance by the Mairna. It carries the Mairna "Night Flider OV-100" patch on the vertical fin and was camoutized in various shades of Gray.**What the Marine Corps had, with the expanded capabilities of the OV-10D, was an observation aircraft uniquely capable for a wide variety of other missions. Primary missions included or night VisuVault/FIR Recommendations, Forward Air Controller (Airborne), Tactical Air Controller (Airborne), Artillery and Naval Confirre Airport, Helicopter Escot and Close-in Fire Suppression. Other missions included Laser Designation, Radio Relay, Visual Combat Air Part (VICSPAR), and Cooky Secor Beam-Air Helicopter Operations.

Throughout the 1980s, all the OV-10/10/Us were retrofitted with a variety of defensive systems. First was the AN/ALEA-39 Countermeasures Dispersing Set (CIT/Filter/Janner). Next was the AN/ALEA-39 Radar Warning Receiver and then the AN/ALEA-34-14 Infrared Countermeasures System. Beginning in the mid-1980s, all OV-10/Us were required in the new IR Supersense Black, Green and Light cry camodling.

The Service Life Extension Program (SLEP) was initiated in 1985 to extend the life of the aircraft beyond the year 2000. The program eventually called for the upgrade of fourteen OV-10Ds, and the conversion of twenty-three OV-10/s to the OV-10/10 SLEP standard. The receivers of the new "D" bus", at a became known, began in 1990 to the active duty squadys. The reserve squadron, VM-04, began transmitting to the OV-10/10-in early 1991.

Very similar in appearance to the original OV-10D, the OV-10/10+ was modified by the Naval Air Network Facility (NARF) at MCAS Cherry Point, North Carolina. The SLEP involved insulating structural reinforcements, new and improved engines, new missions, new writing and plumbing, an improved FLIR, and enhanced communications capability and a reconfigured cockpit featuring a Cockpit Management System (CMS). The gross take-off weight of the aircraft increased to 15,000 pounds.

**To accommodate the new laser and sensor systems, the nose on the OV-10D was extended nearly two and a half test. The FLIR Laser Designator turned its different from the one used on the original YVOV-10D tested in Vietnam. (Steward)**

The large window in the center of the turret covered the Forward Looking Infrared system while the smaller windows to the right covered the laser designator. The center window on the nose covered the landing light while the small covers on either side were for additional radar warning antennas. Also there were large air scoops mounted on either side of the nose for internal cooling. (Steward)**

The new Cockpit Management System provided the pilot and observer with integrated control and display management of navigation, IF, countermeasures and weapons equipment. This system was operated by a Control Display Unit (CPU) in each cockpit consisting of a Cathode Ray Tube (CRT) display, function select keys and an alphanumic keyboard.

The enhanced communications package consists of three solid state multi-band radios (FM/MF/HF/HF) and one solid state HF radio, all controlled through the CMS. The new external antennas associated with this equipment gave the OV-100+ its most distinctive characteristic. This communications equipment provided the OV-100+ are thrown with a tactical communications capability that was second-to-none.

The AN/39-Sloomware at-to-art capability was reinstated with the proper wiring and an adapter between the wire pylon and the missile rail. Also reinstated was the para-drop mission capability when new quick dictic Access to the nose was relatively simple since the nose come lifted upward to expose the FLIR and laser equipment. The tubular structure around the equipment pool is the ground handling ring which made removal of the unit very simple. The small box on the bubbhead behind it is the laser ground safety panel. (Mesko) The OV-10D* proved his practical value time and time again, particularly at the numerous Combined Arms Exeecises over the years and during Operation DREST STORM. The Bronod had logo proven to be the Marine ground commanders most capable and only dedicated Observation and Supporting Arms Coordination asset sharing. No long after Operation DESERT STORM, however, the aimed forces of the United States faced significant force reflections due to economic and political factors. The Marine Corps was soon required to initiate cut-backs in both ground and aviation personnel. Marine Air decided to phase out the OV-10 quadrants early to reduce the number of airframe types is repeated and to help me with its general reduction requirements. As a result, VMO-2 was described in May 1993, VMO-1 was described in July 1993 and VMO-4 was described in June of 1994. The Marine Corps shifted the missions of the OV-10 over the already overtaked FA-18D and AH-1W communities.

Most of the few remaining OV-10A airframes became free fighting lead planes for the California Department of Forestry. A number of OV-10D-2 airframes were transferred to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firements (BATF) for the purpose of day or night surveillance support. The majority of remaining OV-10D+ airframes went into storage at the AMARC facility at Davis-Monton Air Force Base, AZ.

**(Note: This section by Jim Mesko and Major Jeff Clements, USMIC [Ret])**

Due to the additional weight of the ROS modifications, the OV-10D had more powerful engines, 1,040 ship General AirResearch TR-24022 power plants which provided a fortry fine percent increase in available power. Like the earlier engines, these were easy to maintain and the properties related opposite to one another to eliminate torque problems, (Mesko)
Provisions were made for ALE-39 chaffaffline dispeners in the tail booms. These could hold a container of thirty flares. The flare port was basically but an insert with the electrical connections. When not in use a flat plate could be bonded over the opening to improve airflow. ALE-39 could help defeat the SA-6 and SA-7 surface-to-air Russian missiles which first appeared operationally during the late stages of the Vietnam War and the 1973 Crown Kpwr War. (Elements)

The pilots instrument panel changed very little from earlier models except for the addition of a FLR display and switch panel mounted on top of the panel. (Ikesio)

Deliveries of the OV-100 NOS began in 1973. While only the nose and new turret were different externally from the OV-10A, the new tarrent and a certain tough and rugged look to it which was further enhanced by the new three-one Park Green, Dark Gray and Light Gray camouffage scheme - It just looked meant (North American Rockwell)

## 90.10 Ov-10t

One of the more intriguing proposals to come out of the Bronco program was for a transformary within each could also be adapted for the "strike recon"role, i.e. a punship along the lines of the AC-47 Sopology, which was just coming into service in Vietnam. The Air Force approached North American about this in early 1966 and the company responded with a proposal based on a Reed of OV-10A airframe.

Basically the wings were enlarged to fifty feet and a new fuselge was designed. This fuse-lag featured side-by-side sealing for the crew and a much larger cargo compartment with twin hatches, or which served as a ramp for loading and unloading. The orange space in the new compartment was close to 400 cubic feet and it was anticipated that the plane could carry 4,500 pounds of cargo. In addition, it could carry eight passengers, twelve partorons or six stretched cases with two metroLs. The initial Air Force intersect seaweed; however, and inside front artists drawings, no actual work was ever done on the design.

In the early 1970s, North American again came with a proposal, this time for the Navy for a multi-purpose aircraft which could be used for positional support, ECM, early warning, and attack. This proposal envisioned a new wing and LAF 50a microRNA Xocor Corporation engines. A large version using four GE-TF34 engines was also proposed, but neither of these ever got beyond the conceptual stage. In each case the basic fuselge and twin boom tail configuration was kept intact.

## 90.10 Ov-10c

The OV-10C was produced specifically for the Royal Thai Air Force and was identical to **As far as is known the transport version of the Bronco, the OV-10T never got beyond the artist concept stage.** While it retained the basic OV-10 outline, the fuselge was enlarged and featured side-by-side setting for the flight crew. It was envisioned that the cargo variant would be able to carry nearly double the weight of the OV-10A. (NA).

Like the other Bronco sold to foreign air forces, the OV-10Fs purchased by the Indonesian Air Force baseially OV-10As. Indiesen purchased sixteen OV-10FS as replacements for their P-51D Mistungs and began taking deliveries during early 1976. Assigned to No 3 Squadron, and at Bauche, these aircraft have seen combat in the air-to-ground role

The OV-10C was basically an OV-10A with provisions for undergoing Sidefinder missiles removed. Some aircraft sites had a KB-18 strike camera added. This aircraft was camou-finged in a Vietnam type camouflage pattern and was being ferried to Thailand. It is believed that it was later passed to the Philippines. (DAVA)An OV-10A Bronco of the 20th Tactical Air Support Squadron (TASS). This aircraft was flown by the unit commander at Danang during 1969.

for more details of these operations). Sateside training began with eighteen aircraft taken from the Marines during January of 1969 and the unit, designated Light Attack Squadron Four (VAL-4), deployed to Vicament during March with eight aircraft sections being based at Vung Tus and Balth They. Nickamander the "Black Ponies" the Bronos of VAL-4 were soon crisscrossing the Delta in support of U.S. and ARV focus and in search of targets of opportunity. Normally operating in two ship formations, designated Light Attack Five Teams (chart's) the lead ship would normally carry a MR 4.24MM spin port and rockets, which the second ship would carry a 7.62MM mini port and additional rockets. In the Summer of 1971, we found crime YO-100s joined the unit to evaluate the NOOS aircraft in combat. Although originally assigned to VMO-2 at Damag, when they arrived in-country from that their assigned until that good down and a result they operated with VAL-4's crees for three months. The Black Ponies continued operations until April of 1972, when they stood down, the last Navy squadron's inventory to do so.

While the war in Vietnam became more unpopular in the U.S., Bronos operations became even more diverse. They began to drop across along the Lo Chi Minh Trial, her eight inter-diction over Lasse and Cambodia using "Starlight" scopes. During the Cambodia launch in view of My 1970, Navy and Air Force VOF-10 five FAC, strike and cowary outser missions to the US and ARV nrou. But the numbers of Bronos were downlinks the US-out back the its rose strength in Vietnam as a result of the anti-war movement in America. When the North Vietnamese begin their massive ground assault in the Spring of 1972 (the Easter Invasion) only the Air Force had any Bronos left in the war. These were used to direct the massive reutilization carried out by U.S., at power in response to the histamine NA/n attack. Unfortunately, the NavA introduced the shoulder launched SA-7 Stella ground-to-air missile

The **Air Force began training at their counter-insurgency facility in Florida at Huetton** The Field, part of the Belgian Air Force Base complex. This training was conducted by the 4400th, Content Crew Training Squadron, part of the 4100th, Content Crew Training Wing. The aircraft in the background is an Air Command C-123. (Boksamaki via Dodgy) during this campaign and a number of OV-10s were lost or damaged to these new weapons. An Air Force Captain, Steve Bennett, from the 20th TASS won the Congressional Medal of Honor postobarsyn when he saved the life of his observer whose ejection set was disabled by a SA-7 hit on the aircraft's engine. Bennett made a water landing but was unable to escape despite the efforts of his observer to rescue him.

Prior to the withdrawal of U.S. forces from Vietnam, there was a large influx of aircraft to speed up the South Vietnamese Air Force, but no thought was given to upgrading their FAC strength with Bronos. When South Vietnam fell in the spring of 1975, OV-108, based in Thailand stood by in case they were needed to support the evacuation of civilians by the U.S. Navy, and later played a significant effort during operations to free the crew of the SS Mrogager and against Khorge Europos (with CoN Plan Island.

Following the end of the Vietnam War, the Bronos continued to soldier in a variety of robots, although it was mainly used as a FAC. In Marine Corps were, there were a number of squudrons, both active and reserve, which used both the OV-10A and OV-10D. The Navy, although retting the Brono from from-line the late air Vietnam, employed OV-10A in a variety of weapons and tests and research roles. The Air Force kept their own U-10A as FAC aircraft for Tactical Air Command and deployed units to Europe, Korean, Panama and in the continental US. Gradually; however, each service began to downgrade their Bronos fitted and by the early 1990s, only a few Marine and Marine Reserve units were still flying the venerable air.

The **first Air Force OV-10s arrived in Vietnam at Bien Hoa Air Base, northeast of Saigon at the end of July, 1968 aboard C-133 Caropagnasers for evaluation under the code name "Combet Brono". After arrival, the aircraft had to be reassembled at Bien Hoa. (NA via Attwo)**While the Air Force was less than happy in many respects with the Bronco, the Marines level at and used it in a variety of roles. This OV-10 from VIMO-2 patrols with a mixed load at 2.78 inch rocket goods along the South Vietnamese coast south of Damag. The initial insight of VIMO-2 was a driving field for an a Gold four pointed start with the words the "The Angary Two" on a White scroll. (QA via Alikev2009)

Eventually, the Air Force became more user friendly toward the OV-10 and following the initial evaluation program in Vietnam, a special training program was set up using pilots from the evaluation group and other FAC veterans. This core of instructors made the training syllucs very realistic and impact important information to the new pilots. A student pilot and his instructor fly a training mission along the Florida coast during the late 1968a. The aircraft has a faded Red band around the starboard tail boom. (QA via Alikev2009)An Air Force Bronco fits over the South Vietnamese country-side in search of enemy concentrations or supply points. The lightning bolt on the tail indicates that the aircraft is from the 20th Tactical Air Support Squadron. If a target was found the OV-10 crew would then call in fighter-bombers to attack it. (USAF)

Though the OV-10 could carry an extensive array of ornament the Air Force went back and forth between having the sponson mounted 180 machine guns fitted due to losses sometimes suffered when pilots were found on the deck to stop out eyeball-to-eyeball with enemy ground units. These OV-10s carry a load of 2.78 inch rocket pools for target marking to direct fighter-bombers, but no machine guns were carried in the sponsons, which have the gun ports covered over. (USAF)

Additional OV-10s were shipped to Southeast Asia via U.S. Navy escort carriers reconfigured as aircraft transport ships. These aircraft were cocomed to prevent damage from salt at while at sea. A Bronco is offloaded from one of the ships at the port of arrival, Cann Bar Bay. (USAF)

Surprisingly, the Air Force did consider replacing their A-1 Skyraiders with Bronco for the SAINDY rescue escort and support missions to save downed pilots. The endurance and ordinance capabilities of the A-1 hr outweighed that for the OV-10 and the A-1 was kept for the role. This Bronco sits beside an A-1 of the 56th Special Operations Wing based out of Nakhon Phantom, Thailand which controlled air activities over Cambodia, Loos and North Vietnam. (A/a via Alzegro)In 1969 the Navy also got into the Bronco business when it decided that it needed a light support aircraft to provide cover for naval forces operating in the Mexico Delta. The Navy borrowed the needed aircraft from Marine inventories and began to train pilots and ground crews at Naval Air Station North Island at Coronado (San Diego), California This training was conducted by Replacement Air Group (RAG) Squadron VS-41.

(US Meyer) During this period of the Bronco existence is carried little in the way of unusual martings, unlike other aircraft in service at the time. This VALA-UA of the 4400A CCTS, 400m CCIV was one of the more colorfully marked Broncos with a large track path and jing both on the trail. It also had White, Black, Blue and Red bands on the tail boron and a Red scendl on the nose. It was finished in overall COM Gray and White. (TaylorKasukta Vikasu) \\ VUG4, based at Marine Corps Air Station (HCAS) New River, also carried some unusual martings on their Field Green and Gray OV-10As. These included Red and White spinners, White ER tail codes and a Red and White face on the nose outlined in Black. (Nick Waters II) \\ \end{tabular}

As the war in Vietnam progressed the Bronco was used with a variety of ordinance loads, some of which were quite interesting to say the least. This YO-10A form VNO-1-carts carries (or P0P4-22 own own pool, but SUU-11 mini-pup pools and two seven and 2.75 inch Lulu-59 rocket pools in addition to its MOECs in the sponsons. This "Super" gun bird carried the Superman crest on the nose and the VNO-1 magnetism under the pilots cockight. (Burtin)

In particular, Marine Bronco s carried a wide variety of ordinance and other loads on their aircraft. In addition to the rocket pools and mini-pup, this aircraft also carries like-6 float fares which were used to mark night targets on the ground with either Red or Green flames. A total of six fires could be carried on the special rack. (Burtin)The Air Force also tried to improve the effectiveness of the Bronco at night and in poor weather under the Pava IMU configuration. Operated by the 23rd Tactical Air Support Squadron the laser pod under the fuselage was used to locate or designate a ground target. Fifteen of these aircraft were acquired and used until 1974. (USAF)

Two VAL-4 aircraft fit in revenues at Voung Tau Air Base, near the mouth of the Saloon River prior to a mission. Normal procedure for the Black Ponties was to operate two, eight aircraft sections out of Vung Tau and Binh Thuy in support of U.S. and Vietnamese naval units in the Melkoong Delta region. (Wiggs)

During the middle of 1971, the Black Ponties began to change the paint schemes used on their aircraft from the Marine Field Green and Gray to Gulf Grey and White. At the same time a new mission was painted on the aircraft, being carried on the nose while the older rearing stallion was enlarged and placed on a shield on the fin. This particular aircraft was based at Vung Tau. (Mesko)Surprisingly, given its initial reluctance to use the OV-10, the Air Force was the last of the three services to use the aircraft in Vietnam. During the 1972 Eastern invasion by the North Vietnamese, an Air Force built on the Head of Honor when the gave his life to save his future observer in the back seat who could get after the aircraft was hit by a SA-7 missile. Captain Steve benefit made a water landing to save the observer but was unable to get out and drowned in the crash. (USAR)

When the Black Ponies were deactivated during 1972, the remaining OV-104s were returned to the Marine Corps. The Navy; however, continued to use the Bronco for a variety of test roles. This particular aircraft was used by the Naval Air Test Center unit at Park River, Maryland. The aircraft was in the standard Field Green and Grey scheme with a Red and white wing upper surface along with red nose, fin and horizontal tail surfaces. The insignia was not the standard Park River unit crest. (Love)

The Navy squadron responsible for training was VS-41 which operated out of Naval Air Station North Island, in Coronado, California, across the bay from San Diego. One of their aircraft carried a rather unusual Black color scheme during 1971. Most of the unit's aircraft were in the standard color scheme of Marine Field Green and Gray. (USR)

Air Force V0-4s began to loose their light Gray color schemes during the 1960s when they switched over to the European three tone scheme of Greens and Grays. This particular groove was making a rocket marking pass at a target during training at the light of AFP complex in Florida. Initially the aircraft did not carry any identifying markings on their tail when the camourifuge scheme changeover was first made. (USAF)
Eventually tail designation markings were added for identification, which were normally carried on the side of the fin. This aircraft is from the 54th TAS5600T TAX05 based at Patrick AFB, Florida. Originally the tail code was FL, but this was changed to PZ during the late 1980s. The tip of the fin has a Yellow band with small Black stars on it. (Love)

On occasion the 27th TAS58 has marked their squadron designation on the fin along with a Black horse on the motor. These markings seem appear not to have been used wide-ly, if at all, during actual operations by the unit. (Love)

When Kawai was invaded by Iraq on 2 August 1990, the U.S. responded with a massive aerial deployment to the Persian Gulf under the code name Operation DESERT SHiELD While the Air Force decided not to deploy their OV-10s to the region, feeling the aircraft was too vulnerable to survive in such a high filter environment, the Marines had no such qualities and deployed the Marine Air Ground Task Force (MAGTF) to the region.

VMO-2 of MEXT Campello, California launched three OV-10s and three OV-10s to Southwa Asia in late August. The detachment from five to the U.S. east and west to the To Goose Bay, Lahrador. From there the flight continued to Greindel, Iceland, the United Kingdom, Spain, Sicily, Crete, Egypt and finally to Saudi Arabia. The VO-10s already in September and we have used the AV-88 quadranges at King Abdul-AzAzir Air Base on the Persian Gulf Service. The Bronco and Harrier Sauvets were attached to Marine Air Group Thirteen (MAG-13) of the Air Air Air Wing (MgM Abu). The 36th MAV was the designated Aviation Combet Element (ACE) of the 1st Marine Expedition Force (1 MEP). Reinforced with no more OV-100s aircraft that arrived via continue ship, MO- began to tactical training and near an inframization flights throughout the region.

On 8 December 1990, VMO-10 of MACS News River, North Carolina departed from Norfolk, Virginia with even OV-100- aircraft and five OV-10s already the aircraft carries USS ROSOSVELT (CNN-71) and USS AMERICA (CV-66) for Saudi Arabia. The squadron deck launched off the ships near Spain and headed eastward, arriving in Saudi Arabia on 16 January 1991.

VMO-2 began supporting the air air wave of Operation DESERT STORM on 16 January 1991. One aircraft was maintained on alert station treaty-four hours a day, providing as needed. The possibility of duty in the Middle East led to experiments on desert two camolange patterns such as this one of Tan, Brown, and Black. This OV-100 bow probably assigned to VIMO-2. In light of subsequent events, this idea was to prove very prosthetic. (GEB) Visaaf/FELIR Recommission, Artillery and Naval Gunfire Airports, Radio Relay, and Forward Air Couchotter (Airborne). VMO-1 was ready to support air operations on 18 January 1991, and their OV-10s were initially assigned to operate south of 1 MEFs designated Fire Support Coordination Line (PSCL) located near the southerned Kruwait border. The faster and more capable OV-100s were used as much as possible to provide the required coverage; however, OV-10s across week, if needed, on daylight operations.

The primary anti-air threat facing the unit was small arms fire; optically signed Anti-Aircraft Artillery (AAA) and IR homing surface-to-air missiles. The radar controlled AAA threat almost completely suppressed. OV-10 increases utilized the Bronco's defensive countermeasures systems and the aircraft's high maneuverability to survive. The OV-10s aircraft came with IS hypertensive exhausts that helped defeat IR guided weapons. Five of the six VMO-2 Bronco surveys grew a desert camolange of two 100 Brown phosphatases over the Light Blue neurosurfaces. The VMO-1 aircraft were in their standard camolange, and several were required in Air Superiority Greg camolange. Due to a potential Iraqi fighter threat, the aircraft normally fire with one AMB-3 Sidewater for self-defense. The normal offensive load was the four 800Cs, a Zuml podted with White Enobynes (WP) marking packets, another Zuml pod with High Enobynes warth (HE), and at, night, a pod of LU-2 parafores were usually carried.

On the first day of the war, the OV-10s were active Iraqi artillery and controlling AV-88 intrins. On day, an OV-10a from VMO-2 was also down by an IR gel himself sinking. The over repeated sky, but never captured by Iraq. After this incident, the IS missile zones were redder and after this, the OV-10s had to further problems with them.

For the remainder of the air, the OV-10s were active heating a variety of Iraq positions for AV-8 and A-10 airskirts. VMO also received target information from Navy SEALS and Marine Ocean with behind Iraq line. Some OV-10s were used to control Near Outline missions. One of the targets was an Iraqi amo among near the Kawai coastal highway. When the Iraq attacked Khrji, an OV-100s was the first to spot the advancing Iraqi force and controlled \(A\)-a satisfies against them. Throughout the day of the attack, OV-10s continued to retelve empty position information and supported the Coalition counterattack.

When the ground wear began, VMO-1 and VMO-2 both supported the MarineATR on 24 February, with a minimum of three aircraft on station, twenty-four hours per day. During the final Marine offensive to take the International Airport, one OV-10A of VMO-1 found itself over an Iraqi trench complex and before it could getrees the area, at IR missile hit the right engine. The explosion killed the observer, the pilot ejected and observed by the Iraqi troops. Throughout the remainder of the 100 bow normal over, the OV-10s continued to provide support for the Marines, until to cease fire brought an end to the fighting.

During the war, only two aircraft, both OV-10As were lost, both to ground fire. Questions; however, were still raised just how active the Bronco could be in a high filter situation and after the war, the powers that began to give the Bronco and its mission a serious examination. Although it was initially thought that the Bronco would remain in the inventory until the turn of the centre, at least with VMO-4. the Atlanta reserve unit, budget cuts by the anti-millary Clinton Administration and questions about the aircraft's usefulness led to the decision to retire the Bronco from Marine service during 1994. This had already been done by the Air Force with their remaining OV-10s during 1993. In July of 1994, during an impressive ceremony at Dobbins Air Force Base, the Bronco's of VMO-4 were retired, after a quarter century of service.
