## Introduction

On 27 October 1937, agents of the infamous NKVD arrested Andrey Nikoyevich Tupolev on the charge of being a "Class Enemy" who had provided Willy Messerschmitt with plans for an aircraft quite similar to the Bf-110. At the same time a group of other aviation designers and engineers including V. Petakov, V. Myasishchev and A. Putilov were also arrested and put into Baturka Prison.

Tupolev spent almost a year in prison till Laurenti Berlin recalled that there were a large number of aviation designers/engineers in prison and/or labor camps. Beria envisioned the establishment of a special Design Bureau designated the TskB-29 NKVD using the talents of these prisoners. The bureau was also called _Svetkendkendk_, or Special Technical Detachment. Later the name was once more changed to STO (from the Russia war door Of One hundred). As a result, arterial designed by the Bureau were designated 100, 102, 103, 110 etc. Among the 15 members of this design burne were six future members of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, twelve professors and assistant professors, seventhet chief designers and other aviation specialists.

While in prison, Tupolev designed what was perhaps the best Soviet bomber of the Second World War. Originally known as Aircraft 103, the aircraft was later redesignated as the Tu-2A. After the outbreak of the Second World War, Stain was forced to look for ways to strengthen the Red Army and Air Force. Imprisoned military officers were released, as were the members of the STO. Tuupolev was set for one 27 July 1941. His bomber, however, had been taken out of production so that airlike factory space could be used to produce Yakovlev Yak 7 fighters. The Yak 7 received production priority as a result of the political efforts of A.S. Yakovlev, who had taken full advantage of his position as the deputy minister for the aviation industry.

Yakovlev was also partially responsible for the decision that ended production of strategic bombers for the Soviet Air Force (VVS) throughout the war system. When the war drew drew to a close, the Soviets found that they did not have a true strategic bombers With the introduction of nuclear weapons, the importance of heavy strategic bombers increased significantly. Although it had been decided to develop long range miss missiles as the primary platform for Soviet nuclear power, introduction of these vehicles was still a long way of and until they could be developed, only a long range strategic heavy bomber could carry a nuclear bomb over the distances required.

The position to the bomber problem appeared as fly buck. On 29 July 1944, a Boeing B-29-5-BW (42-6256) Superformeters piloted by CAPT Howard R. Jarrell was damaged by anti-aircraft fire during an attack on the B8-9x Steel Works at A. Danhole to make it back to home base, Jarrell headed the B-29 ward the Soviet Union and landed on the small airfield at Tarrichana. After week of interrogation, Jarrell and his crew were sent to an intermittent camp in Turkestan.

Three weeks later, a second Superformeters, B-29A-1-BN (42-93829), crashed near Khabarovski. Finally, during November 1944, a third B-29-5-BW (serial 42-6358) fell in Soviet Bands. These three H-29A, at the time the most advanced production number in the world, became the prototypes of a new Soviet strategic bomber. With the B-29s available to serve as pattern aircraft, the Russians abandoned several designs (among Tunoleys' Design 64) and concentrated on copying the American B-29.

It was not a simple task. Even without the difficulty of converting all the American measurements to the metrics system, the Soviet aviation industry was completely unprepared to take advantage of the advanced technology in the Superformeters. Tuupolev's team was assigned the task of copying and adapting the B-29 airframe, while A. B. Shvetsov's bureau was to copy the Wright-Cyclone R-335 engine. Other teams were occupied in copying the aircraft's electronics, armament and other systems.

The Superfortress was copied in an incredibly short period of time and, on 3 August 1947, three new B-29s wearing Red star markings few over the spectators on Moscow's Red Square during an military display. These were the first three aircraft of a twenty aircraft pre-production batch produced by Tuupolev under the designation Tu-4 (NATO reporting name Bull). These aircraft were almost identical to the B-29, differing mainly in having the pressurized cover compartments built as separate sections without a connecting tunnel.

Over the course of Tu-4 production of the defensive armament was strengthened. Initially, the Tu-4s were produced with an armament of ten 12.7MM machine pins. These were changed to 20MM cannons and still later to 23MM weapons. The Tu-4 became the standard bomber of Soviet long-range aviation through three late 1940s. Its slow and so a tanker, cargo transport (Tu-5), paraOn 17 December 1947, the American Boeing B-47 Stratjet made its maiden flight and Tiople was pressed to speed up work on several new jet bother projects. During 1949, Upucky started construction of Design 83, but the project was abandoned before the prototype was completed. During this same time period, the preliminary sketches of three new designs, (86, 88 and 90) appeared on Tiople's drawings board.

Tupoley initially proposed the three different designs to replace the Tu-41. All three featured the same fussae design, differing mainly in the engines. Design 86 was also have been equipped with the Mihaila AM-TRD-42 (TR-3) engines in underongnodals. The engines proved unreliable and underpowered, causing Tiople's to abandon the aircraft. Despite 89 was also abandoned because of problems with its engines (NK-12 turbo-props).

Tupoley had preferred Design 88 (also referred to as the the Type N for scenarios) and decided to do a based with development of this aircraft. Design 88 was designed to use the powerful 19,290 pounds thrust (130) AM-43 turbojet engine built by the Mikulin OKB. Dmitri S. Maxow appointed as project chief engineer with Tuple supervisions all work on the project.

Tupoley was not satisfied with the early fussae design because its wide cross-section. Eventually, Tiopley developed an area in error, narrower cylindrical shaped (weaking with the engines semi-crossed) along the fussae sides. The diameter of this fussae was partially determined by the diameter of the largest Soviet bomb, the FAB-9000, which was be carried in the bomb bay.

Wind tunnel testing of the Design 88 in the TSAGI-101 wind tunnel showed that the design was very clean with a very low drag. During the early 1950s there were many advocates of the wing root engine installation mainly because of its low drag and the fact

## 4 Tu-16 Badger A

The production Tu-16 differed little from the prototype except in the position of the pilot tubes on the nose, the shape of the main landing gear doors, and in the types of antennas carried. The main landing gear doors were changed with the single piece front opening door being deleted in favor of two piece side opening doors. The two pilot/air sensor tubes on the nose under the cockpit were repositioned and the single blade antenna in front of the cockpit was changed to a three pole IFF antenna (NATO report-name on the noseId).

The production Tu-16 was classic in bowner which was given the NATO reporting name Badger. A the aircraft was equipped with an internal bomb bay mounted in the fuselage between the engines. This was large enough to house an EAB-9000 bomb (although the bomb produced slightly from the bomb bay) or a combination of smaller bombs up to a total of 9000 kg (19.942 pounds).

Defensive arrangement of the Tu-16 Badger A consisted of three remote controlled gun (fasturai, and serial) attached armed with win 236M NR-23 cannons. Additionally, a single fixed RxD-23 cannon was mounted on the strabard side of the nose just behind the bombard's position and fired by the pilot. For navigational purposes and blind bombing a PRS-1 AG Argon bomb/nav radar was mounted in a streamlined radon on the underside of the fuselage just behind the navigator/bombardard's compartment.

The crew compartments consisted of pressurized compartment in the nose and a second pressurized compartment in the tail for the two rear gunners. In the prototype, three compartments were connected by a tunnel, however, this feature was deleted on production Tu-16. Entry to the two compartments was made through three hattes in the fuselage undercid: one on the nose, and two at the rear of the aircraft.

It is believed that most of the 2.000 Tu-16 produced were the basic Badger A bomber air, with the superstrong variants being remanufactured/modified Bader As. Late production Badger A suffered from earlybacks in having lengthened wing air and flow forces, an enlarged pinch radone and in the positioning of various windows and hatches.

One modified Tu-16 Badger A (Serial 4201002) was tested between 1954-55 with a greatly increased fuel capacity. This increased the gross weight from 17.560 to 75.800 (18.38) which was caused together by this force from 2800 km to 288 km and the rabbit run to go from 19.000 to 2.800 km/s (17.266). After successful testing, this new configuration was cleared for production, allowing Badger A bomber to carry significantly more fuel with the same bomb load.

Another modification that occurred early during Badger A production was the replacement of the 8.750 kg (19.290 lbsd) AM-3 engines with more powerful 9.500 kg (20.948 lbsd) AM-3 engines (these engines were redesigned, RD-37, when Serpey et al. (2004) lbsd) AM-3 engines (these engines were redesigned, RD-37, when Serpey et al. (2004) lbsd) Tandem be OK (Obsak et al. after Alexander Mikulin was dismissed for misconocid. The re-enginted Tu-16 Badger A had a good (10.50 km) (652 mph), ac ceiling of 1500 meters (92.13 lbsd) and a range of 7.200 km (4.474 miles).

Although externally identical to the Tu-16 Badger A, a dedicated atomic bomb carrier, the Tu-16A, was built as a modification of the basic Tu-16 airframe. Another modification was the Tu-16T, a torped bomber with a modified bomb bay, which could allow Rout RM-23:perpey, two WB-27 pointed bombs, twelve AMD-500 mines or four AMD-1000 mines. Again, this aircraft was externally identical to the standard Tu-16 Badger A and no new NATO name was assigned.

There are reports that Soviet Badger As have participated in combat operations during the Afghan war. Tu-16 of the VVS reportedly carried out medium level bombing attacks against targets in Afghanistan from their bases across the border in Uzbekistan, although it is believed that there were only a small number of such operations.

### Tu-16b Tanker

A number of TU-16 Badger A bombers were converted to the aerial tanker role by monitoring a fast tank in the bomb bay and installation a recling house system in the same way with this system is unique and requires the receiver aircraft to engage the trailing house with its port winging. Once engaged, the fuel-host is begun and its estimated that replacing this method requires some ten to fifteen minutes to complete.

Later tanker enhancement of the Tu-16b discarded the winging hose for a house and drogue refending method, similar to that used by the U.S. Navy. The house basket is stowed in the bomb bay of the Badger A tanker and reted out to be engaged by the probe of the receiver aircraft (such as Tu-22 Binder, Tu-95 Bear and Tu-22M Backfire bomers).

## Missile Carriers

To meet the needs of the Soviet Naval Air Arm (AV-MF) for a stand-off anti-ship mis-scl carrier, Toplevo modified the basic Tu-16 aircraft to carry two KS-1 (NATO reporting, name AS-I Kemen) air-to-surface cruise cruise cruise cruise under the designation T-16KS-1. This Badger variant was first revealed to the West during 1961 and received the NATO reporting name Badger.

Internally, there is little difference between the Tu-16KS-1 Badger B and the standard Tu-16 Bader A, with both aircraft being equipped with a bomb by for level bombing. There are some savings and electronics differences, with the Badger B being equipped with the Komet III III band radar in a addition to the standard bomb/nav radar. External, the Badger B different from the Badger A in having a missile pylon under each wing capable of carrying a single KS-1 (AS-1) missile, and in the addition of a small window on the port fuselage side near the engine air intake. The KS-1 _Kylaiyi Snariad_ was designed by the Mikoyan ORB. It was a small pilotless aircraft im appearance to the Mikoyan ORB. It was a small pilotless aircraft im appearance to the Mikoyan ORB. It was powered by a RD-500 turboje engine, had a top speed of 1.200kB (745 mph), a range of 200 km (124 miles) and was armed with a 900 kg (1,984 pound) high explosive warhead.

The missile was guided by data link corrections supplied by the Komet III radar housed in a retrotable raodure under the Badger B's center fuselage. Missile terminal homing was accomplished by a small onboard radar mounted in the missile is nose. Operationally, the Badger B's assigned mission was anti-shipping strike, with its primary target being the aircraft of the US. Navy.

Besides seeing service with the Soviet Naval, atteward Tu-16KS-1 Badger B were supplied to the Indonesian Air Force (TN-IAU) where they equipped two squadators, Nos 41 and 42. These aircraft were active during the Indonesian confrontation with Malaysia flying routes into Malaysian airspace passenger Singapore. The Indonesian Badgers remained active until they were forced out of service by a lack of spare parts.

When the KS-1 became obsolete, many Badger B's had their missile pyloms removed the aircraft reverted to the conventional level bombing role, while others were converted to carry later missiles.

Figure 1: **A**: 16KS-1 Badger B for the Indonesian Air Force (TR-All) marked on a tausway at an indoonestan Air Force Base. After the break in relations between Indonesia and the Soviet Union, support for the Badgers was withdrawn. The aircraft were soon out of service due to a lack of spare parts.

**Tu-16K-10 Badger C**

As the KS-1 missile became outdated and was superseded by larger, heavier, more powerful cruise missiles, the Tu-16 was further modified to serve as the launching platform for the next generation of stand-off weapons.

The next cruise missile to enter twice was the K-10 (NATO reporting name AS-2 Kipper) a supersonic, anti-ship weapon. To be able to carry and provide guidance for the K-10, a number of modifications to the basic Tu-16 airframe were necessary. These resulted in the next variant of the Badger, the Tu-16K-10 known to NATO as the Badger C.

The K-10/AS-2 Kipper was almost ten meters (32 feet) long and weighed 4.500 kg/ 93200 pounds (including a 1000 kg/2400 pound wanted). It was powered by the RD-9 turbogenifying system speed and a range of 250 km (155 miles). The missile was carried under the fuselose of the Tu-16K-10, even-increased in the bomb bay.

To mount a radar powerful enough to guide the K-10 over its entire range, the glass nose of the Tu-16 Badger A was replaced with a large, flat randome. This radome housed the target acquisition guidance radar (NATO reporting name Puff Ball). In an attack, the K-10 is guided to the target by a preprogrammed autopilot with updates from the launching Badger C radar. When it means the target area, the Tu-16K-10 issues command guidance instructions and illuminates the target with the Puff Ball. In the terminal phase of the attack, the missile is guided by its onboard radar.

Other modifications to the Badger C include the addition of two small windows on the fuselage side just behind and below the cockpit and the addition of two small raked back blade antennas to the fuselage underside forward of the bomb bay.

## Badger C Modified

The Tu-16 Badger C Modified differed from the standard Badger C in the addition of wing pylons (identical to those mounted on the Badger B) for carrying two supersonic AS-6 (NATO reporting name Kingfish) anti-ship missiles.

## 11 Mu-16 Badger G

When the AS-5 (NATO reporting name Ketl) was introduced into service during 1968, a decision was made to arm the Badger with these updated and improved missiles. Externally identified to the earlier Badger 8 (and believed to be rebuilt from Badger B airframes) the Ketl missile carrier was first identified by NATO during September of 1968 and given the reporting name Badger G. The Badger G carried two AS-5s while retaining its free fall bombing capability. The main difference between the Badger B and Badger G, besides the missiles, was in the radar carried by the Badger G. The Argon nav/ bombing radar was replaced by a long range target acquisition radar (NATO reporting name Short Horn).

The AS-5 Kelt was powered by a liquid fuel rocket engine and was equipped with an improved guidance system. The AS-5s are turned with a 2,2000 wound and employs a programmed autoduit with command updates and active radar terminal homing. The missile has a speed of Mach. 1.2 and a range of 200 miles. It is estimated that, as of 1976, about 1,000 Ketl misiles have been produced.

Just before the outbreak of the June 1967 Six-Day Arab-Israeli War, the Egyptian Air Force had on strength some twenty 10-16K5-1 Badger Bytes. These Badgers were destroyed during the first few hours of the war and some hook part in the fighting. After the war, the Sowie s quickly replaced the Egyptian losses with another twenty Tus-16s. These aircraft were Badger Gs armed with two AS-5Kelt missiles.

During the course of the October 1973 Yomi Kippur War, Egyptian Tu-16 Badger Gs launched some twenty-five Ketl missiles against Israel targets. Most of these were shot down by Israeli filters and anti-aircraft defenses. Only five hit their targets, destroying two radar stations and a supply dump in the Sinai. One Tu-16 was shot down during the war. At present Egypt possesses some sixteen Tu-16s which are assigned to the bomber brigade based in the southern part of the country.

After the break in relations between Egypt and the Soviet Union on 14 March 1976, the Soviet out of the supply guard parts for Soviet equipment including the Tu-16s. As a result, Egypt turned to China. According to an agreement signed during April 1976, Egypt was applied with spare parts for the Chinese built Tu-16 variant, the H-6 bomber. Reportedly, part of the deal included the exchange of modern Soviet military equipment to China including at least two-238N Teogret Fighter-bomber.

A number of Badger Gs and AS-5Kelt missiles were also supplied to the Iraqi Air Force where they have seen combat. Reportedly, Iraqi Badgers were used to launch AS-5 attacks against Iranian targets during the early phases of the Iran/tra war.

## 12 Badger G Modified

During December of 1977, a Japanese Air Self Defense Force F-86 fighter pilot took a photograph of a Tu-16 Badger G armed with a new missile on its underwing pylon. This missile was later identified as the AS-5 (NATO reporting name Kingfish). With the change in missile armament came a change in the NATO reporting name, with these Badger Gs now being referred to as the Badger G Modified or, more commonly, the Badger G Mod.

Since that time, the AS-6 armed Badger G Mod has gradually replaced the Badger G/AS-5 combination in Soviet Naval service. The AS-6s is powered by a liquid fuel rocket motor giving the weapon a speed of Mach. 3. The missile has a range of 200 km (124 miles) at low level or 500 km (310 miles) at altitude. It is guided by a autopilot with mid-course correction (via data link) and terminal radar homing. The Kingfish can be armed with a conventional 1,000 kg (2,200 pounds) explosive warned or a nuclear weapon.

The Badger G Modified armed with one or two AS-6s-missiles (depending on mission duration) has become the basic strike variant of the Badger in Soviet Naval service. To maintain a constant level flight attitude prior to missile launch, the Badger G Mod has a small inverted T-shape device on the nose just above the bombardier's station. Additionally, a number of Badger G Mods have had the nose mounted Short Horn radar replaced by a larger radome mounted on the fuselage underside just in front of the weapons bay.

**Tu-16 Recon Variants**

**Tu-16 Badger D**

During the early 1960s, the Tu-16 airframe was rejected as the best availa high platform to meet the needs of the Soviet Navy for a dedicated maritime reconnaissance/electronic intelligence (ELINT) aircraft. As a result of this decision, the Tu-16K-10 Badger C was modified for the new mission.

The cruise missile systems were deleted with the missile recess being faired over and three additional blister antennas were added to the fuselage underside. The aircraft was first observed by the West during 1962 and given the NATO reporting name Badger D.

The Badger D differs from the Badger C in having all offensive capability deleted and the addition of three blister fairing for passive accidents antennas installed on the fuselage underside. Additionally, the chin radome under the nose is slightly enlarged. The Badger D serves with the Soviet Navy in the maritime reconnaissance role and also can be used to provide mid-course guidance for missile launched by other Badgers.

The crew of the Badger D has been increased from six to eight/nine men depending on the special equipment/sensors carried by the aircraft. This increase in crew became common with all electronic/ reconnaissance Badgers.

**The Badger D was a conversion of the Badger C missile carrier and shares the same nose randome. The chin radome on the Badger D, however, is slightly larger than the radome used on the earlier Badger C.**

## Tu-16R Badger E

All Tu-16s can be used for strike reconnaissance utilizing the vertical camera that is installed in a small compartment just in front of the bomb bay. This camera was intended to provide updating target photographs and for bomb damage assessment and not as a true reconnaissance tool.

To meet the need of a long range reconnaissance aircraft, especially in the maritime role, the Tu-16 airframe was selected and modified to produce a special reconnaissance variant under the designation Tu-16s.

The Tu-16s was introduced into service during the early 1960s and received the NAT reporting game Badger. E. It differed from the standard Badger A bomber in having cameras installed on a pallet within the bomb bay along with additional bomb bay fast thanks. There are two underlensive blister passive receiver antennas, carried just forward and to the rear of the weapons bay, for electronic reconnaissance duties.

This Badger F has been modified with additional sensor antennas over the cockpit on short pylons on the nose and just behind the cockpit.

There is a new Electronic Counter Measures (ECM) antenna just above the Bee Hind gun laying radar radome on this Badger F. This blister probably houses a radar warning receiver antenna.

Besides the new sensor blisters above the cockpit, this Badger Fhas an electronics blister on a short pylon alongside the nose and a new shaped blade antenna just behind the cockpit.

To provide for electronic jammer escort of strike forces, primarily missile carrying Badergs, an electronic counter measures (ECM) variant was designed under the designation - tu-16PP _Oranstechnik bomek_. The 16-16PP Bader H was a specialized chief air-carl, capable of carrying up to 9,000 kg (19,840 pounds) of aluminum chaff strips in special containers carried in the bomb boxy.

The chaff strips are cut into sections of different lengths just before they are dropped. The strips should have a length of one-half the radar wavelength of the station which is to be jammed. In order to accomplish this, the Tu-16PP has one tear drop shaped passive antenna blister just in front of the bomb bay doors and another tear drop blister on the bomb bay doors are near the portion of the bay. A third smallest blister is carried immediately in front of the bomb bay. These blister antennas house passive receivers that cover the expected radar frequency range to be encountered. They are used to pick up the enemy radar signals, identify them and establish the proper length of the chaff strips. A large disperach hatch is located just behind the bomb bay.

Bader H aircraft would normally be used to accompany a strike force and provide protection from surface-to-air missiles and enemy fighter direction radars.

## Tu-16R Badger K

The most recent variant of electronic reconnaissance Badgers was first identified during 1981 and assigned the NATO reporting name Badger K. Externally similar to the earlier Badger E, it is equipped with no passive electronics blisters just in front of and just behind the bomb bay. The Badger K also has a large window on the port fuselage side just forward of the standard fuselage window. It is believed that this window houses an oblique camera installation.

Most Badger Ks also have a deeper, flatter, chin radome and several new blade antennas on the upper fuselage behind the cockpit.

One of the differences between the Tu-16 Badger K and the earlier Badger E are the additional blade antennas above the cockpit. The three dipole antennas on the nose in front of the cockpit are the antenna array for the Odd Rods IFF system.

## Tu-16 Bader L

Recently, a further modification to the Tu-16-airframe has been identified and given the unofficial designation Bader L. During August of 1986, the Soviet aviation magazine ("Aviation and Communative" published a photograph of a Tu-16 in service with the Naval Air Force (AV-MP). This Bader differed from earlier variants in a number of ways. There was a new intuitive by pde name added to the extreme end of the nose above the bombaker's compartment, the chin radome was larger and flatter, and there was a large blade antenna above the door.

Other modifications included the addition of several small electronics blisters under the nose and on short pylons on the fuselage sides near the air intakes. There are also two undivering pools carried on short pylons. Although not positively identified, it is believed that these pools are all/flare shelf protection jammers. The aircraft also carried an unusual color scheme for a Bader, being Natural Metal over Gloss White.

Besides the thimble random on the nose, the aircraft has a number of other features in common with its model Tu-142 Bear anti-subrahmer/martinez reconnaissance aircraft. The two unidentified spots on the short understepping errors are identical to those seen on Bear. It is believed that these spots are soft protection chief/frae dispenses. Also in common with Bear Gs are the small dictoric blisters near the intakes.

Chinese Badgers

The Soviet Union first supplied China with the Tu-16 during 1958 just before military cooperation and other sites between the two countries was broken out. Part of the disagreement between the two countries centered over the aggressive stand China had taken meaning Taiwan. Under the protection of the Russian atomi umbrella, China had undertaken military efforts against Taiwan that stopped just short of invasion. The Soviet refused to transfer nuclear technology to China helped to harade the rift between the two countries.

The Chinese had planned to undertake license production of the Tu-16, however, and had received several pattern aircraft. Without Soviet technical assistance, they were forced to use the same method the Souges had with with the B-2\(\rightarrow\) copy and reverse engineer the few aircraft that had been delivered.

The Chinese reverse engineered version of the Tu-16 is built at Xian under the designation H-6 (Hongzhaj) bomber 6). This designation is frequently westernized in various publications as the B-6. Chinese variants are also designated by NATO as the Bader, although to a separate letter designor has been applied to them. The copied RD-37 engine received the Chinese designation Wopen-8 (WP-8).

The H-6 has become a powerful element of the Chinese peptides LiLternary Air Force and during May of 1996 an H-6-topured the third Chinese atomic bomb during that series of bomb tests. The first production H-6 was delivered during 1986, some ten years after the first Tu-16 entered Chinese service. Subsequent production has continued a slow pace with an estimated total production of 20 aircraft as of 1987.

The majority of H-6 was ordered are level bombers, although there are unconfirmed reports of mechanisance, electronic warfare and tanker versions. During the May 1995 Paris Sala, the Chinese Foreign Trade Office (CPHTC) defined a new version of the H-6 designated He-1F (B-6). This aircraft is cruise missile carrier armed with two C-601 (BATO reporting name Silworth) anti-ship cruise missics carried on large under this pyloms.

These missics are copies of the Russian R-15 (NATO reporting name SS-N-2 Styya), a surface-to-surface anti-ship missile normally carried on surface ships or launched from prepared coastal defense shore sites. These weapons were supplied to the Chinese during the late 1958 and served as the starting point for development of the C-601 air launched Silworth anti-ship cruise missics on underwing pyloms and a deeper, flat bottomed adenoma in place of the chin radiome of the bomber variant. There are reports that number of H-6's have been sold to Iraq with a quantity of C-601 Silworth missics. China is also the primary supplier of Tu-16/H-6 spare parts for the Egyptian Air Force, enabling the Expytians to maintain their Bader Gs without Soviet assistance.
