## Introduction

During 1955 the Navy's Long Range Objectives Study Group staff recognized that there was a need for a new attack aircraft. This aircraft would supplement the Douglas A-1 Skymaker and Douglas A-4 Skymaker, in service with the light attack squadres and the Douglas A-3 Skymaker and Nonbian A-5 Skymaker in use with the heavy attack squadres. The Navy wanted an attack aircraft that could fly faster, and carry a bigger and more sophisticated variety of weapons over a greater distance than the venerable A-1 Systorade or the lightweight A-4-0. One of the capabilities that the new design was to restore the shawley to fly low-level missions at night under all weather conditions. This requirement was considered to be of paramount importance.

In February of 1957 Gunnium received Type Specification 149 along with Boeing, Douglas, Vought, Martin, Lockheed, Bell and North American Aviation. All of these companies presented their proposed designs and by December of 1957 the competition had been reduced to Douglas, Gunnman and Vongbha, On 30 December 1957 the Navy announced that the Gunnman Aircraft Corporation, led by the design common composed of Lawrence M. Mead, Robert Naffs and Bruce Tuttle, had we then design competition.

In May of 1958 the Continuum Aircraft Corporation formally signed a contract with the Navy to construct a full-scale mock of other winning medium attack aircraft design. In 1959 they received a one hundred million dollar incentive for development and production contract. Of key importance was the fact that this was the first cost plus incentive contract ever awarded for a full weapons system (afterafter, radar, software and Bomb/Invoking/Invoking) computer. Thermann design team had the foresight to press for the responsibility of designing the entire weapons system and this approach led to the development of the first reliable integrated weapons system of any Naval aircraft.

**Ordance personnel load five inch rockets on the port wing pylons of an AD-2 at NAS Patient River during September of 1950. The Introder eventually replaced the venerable Systorade in fleet service, but it was a number of years before the goods were all retired from active duty. (USH)**

Construction of the first YA2F-1 (BuNo147864) began during early 1959. The prototype emerged as a large two seat (side-by-side seating) aircraft dominated by the large nose condensate (which bosed into radar antenna arrays) and check air intakes. It featured swept mid-mounted wings and a long tuering fraelge. Is mailed flight lock place on 16 April 1960 with Grunman rest pilot Bill SNyth at the controls. Four days prior to this flight, the company announced that the name Introder had been selected for the new aircraft. The name was chosen from the four thousand suggested names which were turned in during a company wide context. In October of 1952 the Navy changed to aircraft designation system and the A2F inductor became the A-6A Hurtor.

The A6A approved by two 8,500 last Part & Whitney J-52-P-6 engines gave the Intrader further reliability and performance than a single engine design. Feedback from operational attack across heavily endorsed this feature of the aircraft since it provided them with an added margin of safety. The forward location of the engines enabled the aircraft designers to use short and efficient air intakes. Initially it was intended to incorporate tilting tulippers in the murder to meet the STOI. (Short Taked and Landing requirement of the Marine Corps. This was abandoned when it was constrained the tilting it gives prices only reduced landing speed by some seven miles per hour at normal approach weights. The test be aircraft demonstrated that it could with the tell up this in a shorter distance than they could alkert at heavier weights with the tell up in the down position. Additionally, the Navy considered the 104 mph landing speed to be acceptable; therefore, the vetoed thrust feature of the tiled tail pipes was expelled. This was a cost saving effort by the Navy that initiated some intense discussions with the Marine brass. The tilting pipes were replaced with stationary pipes, beginning with aircraft number eight (BuNo 14863).

Arifframes (2BuNo 147865) and 3 (BuNo 147866) were completed in September of 1960

**The first YA-2F Introderotype (BuNo 147864) had a small rudder and was fitted with a long instrument test probe on the nose. The aircraft featured tilting jet tail pipes that were intended to give the aircraft a STOI, capability. (Grumman)**and all three aircraft were assigned to the structural and aerodynamic flight test program. Although the testing program was very successful, it had some incidents that could have proved disastrous were it not for the skill of the test pilots. On 28 July 1960 test pilot Ernle Vonderfeltrag made a desatkore landing with aircraft #2 at Calverton test field following a flight from Guomman's Betheridge facility, it was determined that at a flat shortly valve had been installed incorrectly.

In the Fall of 1960 another incident involving a test aircraft occurred during a dynamic pressure test flight with power on and the fuselge speed was outc. The test pilot noticed a slowness in the pitch response. A review and follow-up of the report revealed that the aerodynamic flight movements on the tail stabilizes had exceeded the hydraulic actuator quickly which resulted in an actuator stall. With the fuselge strike at brake in the extended position the down wash pattern of the tail was caused the center of pressure to move inward and forward, thus sharply increasing the line movements. To correct this, the horizontal subillies were moved forward on the fuselge by sixteen inches.

Test aircraft numbers 4 through 7 (Shows 147867, 148615-148617) were assigned to the systems development program. Aircraft No. 4 conducted search radio with a 3500 camera assembly attached to the underscript of the fuselge just to the rear of the road. The other three aircraft performed navigation, attacks and tracking radar tests. Four significant pre-production changes were made during 1961 to the A-AA motor. Split up signed breakes beam standard since it was determined that the fuselge speed brakes were inadequate when dive-bombing and during carrier approaches where quick response drag control is critical. The

The fourth A-ZF test aircraft (Bulito 147867) was used in ordinance testing as part of the weapons system development program. The first was named with thirty 83 General purpose low drag bombs, six on each of the five ordinance pylons. (Grumman)

A-6A Intruder

The A-6A Intruder is basically constructed of aluminum. Its fuselage is of semi-monocoque construction, however, the ventral area is composed of a deep structural level beam of steel and titanium, located between the engines and the non-structural doors that enclose the engine compartment. The wings, vertical and horizontal stabilizers are of multibeam construction with machined aluminum skin and honeycomb trailing edges. The center section of the wing is a box beam that passes through the fuselage which is milled from a solid block of aluminum alloy. This gives the Intruder recommends strength and weight lifting capabilities.

The heart of the A-6A Intruder is the Digital Integrated Attack and Navigation Equipment (DANN), without this system the Introre's attack capability would have been severely limit-off. DIANE and its sub-systems enable the crew to attack unexpected targets or targets of opportunity with a variety of ordinance under many different facial and environmental conditions without the crew crew having to look outside the cockpit from launch to recovery. This innovative system was not immune to the various spratins that shavy emerge into new systems and it was Gumman Technical Representatives and their Navy counterparts who worked out of the bugs he hurst the harpar to center fleet service.

V-A2, the Atlantic Replacement Air Group (RAG), received the fleet's first two A-6Ans in February 1963 when they were accepted by five Admiral Frank O'Beine, Commander in Chief Atlantic Refer (ECICANTERT), V-A7-5 Sunday Prunches became the second squadron to receive the murder and they trained with V4-2 at NAS Coens, Virginia. The squadron's complement, for the most part, with scops of one month from squads that had operated A-4 Skyshanks and A-3 Skysurrinos. Following their initial training and a short shakedown **This early production A-6A (Rulto 149485) carried a pilot tube on the port wing. The stylized 6 on the rudder identified the aircraft as being assigned to the service test role at NAS Patancourt River, Maryland during 1963. (USH)**that the average for full systems being up was 26 percent and radar reliability was approximately 40 percent. Even with these problems, maintenance personnel were always able to provide aircraft for night and foil weather series. Even when a high percentage of the various system was not up to put the hardware was still the best attack aircraft on the carrier. The squadron entered combat with the A-6A during July of 1965, attacking bridges at Bac Bang, North Velt Nam.

The A-6A most serious operational problem was related to the separation of the bombs from the bomb tracks and one further was lost due to the early explosion of its own bombs. The problem was solved by replacing the mechanical bomb tracks with the Multiple Ejector Rock (MEB). This Douglas designed bomb track provided an explosive, sequenced release that bomb cathode to clear the wing and kept the bombs from colliding and exploiting near the aircraft.

When the production of the A-6A stopped on 28 December 1970, the Intruder was serving in fourteen Navy and six Marine squadrons and some 488 aircraft had been produced. The Navy and Marine Corps were the only operators of the A-6A and no foreign sales of the A-6A were ever approved.

A-6B

The A-6B was basically an A-6A that was modified to carry the General Dynamics ACM-78Mod 0 Standard ARM (anti-radiation missile). The first A-6B was converted during 1967 under the Iron Hand program. The missile was designed to home an radiation emitted from ground ranks as surface-to-air (SAM) missile guidance tracks, free control tanks for gun sizes and ground-controlled intersection (GCI) tanks that directed defending lighters.

The A-6B differs from the A-6A principally in the equipment installed for navigation and weapons delivery. The first ten A-6B were stripped 4-6As with navigation equipment only and these possessed ground attack capability. The next three A-6Bs were 4-6As and 6-6As from the production line and modified to the Passive-Angle-Tracking/Ant-Radiation Missle (PAT/ARM) configuration. The final A-6Bs were pulled from fleet aircraft during 1970 and modified to the Target Identification Acquisition System (TIAAS) configuration. All three A-6B configurations were capable of operating with the AGM-78 missile, either the Mod 0 or Mod 1.

A-6Bs were distributed to various fleet A-6 squadars, usually two or three to a unit. The A-6B saw combat with a number of squadars, namely, A-52, VA-75, VA-85, VA-145, VA-196 and VM42-24. The PAT/ARM A-6Bs were serviced with VA-165, VA-52, VA-55, VA-95 and VA-15. This variant did not have the nose and neckle blisters used on the first A-6Bs (and 0). The A-6B TIA was similar differed from the earlier A-6Bs in that it carried and both the blisters and "bottle car" button radar receiver antennas.

**This A-6B (Buito 151562) (TIAAS-Mod 1) was stored at NAS Norfolk, Virginia with a protective coating sealing in the aircraft. The location of the radar receiver button antennas on the rradone are clearly visible. There are a total of twelve button antennas, two on each side and eight in the center of the rradone (Author)**

A-6C

A-6Cs were conversions of A-6AAs as a direct result of the Navy's Trails, Roads, Inchertic Multisensor Program. (TRIM). The A-6C differed from the A-6A in that it carried additional sensors in a centerline pod. The aircraft was modified to carry a Doppler frequency (DF) receiver and no ulcer-optical sensors in a large rate drop shaped on the aircraft centerline. This extended the capability of the error to detect, track and attack significant radar into non-radler reflective targets. The theoretical approach consisted of a slow light level system (LLLTV) system and a forward-looking infrared (FLIR) system located in the pod attached to the fuselone centerline weapons station. This reduced the normal A-6A weapons carrying capability somewhat with the loss of the centerline external station and an infrared handuped ghost stations and 2-4 that were also systems the in the cockpit-controls and nd in the computer software to accommodate the TRIM system.

Testing of the TRIM system began in earnest during 1967. An early combat evaluation of TRIM, housed in four modified Ar-2B Neptunes based at Can Ramb Bay, South Vietnam between September 1968 and June 1969, respectively, though feedback to Gaumnon to bring out first Na-6A (BNA 14767) on line as a TRIM system test bed. Initially the TRIM system was placed in using mounted angular block on the onboard flyions. Eventually these were replaced by a fuselone pad that could be detached when not needed. Because of the extra weight of the pad, an E-6A full hook assembly was stratified to the A-6C to accommodate the higher landing weight of the A-6C.

The first A-6C s to be delivered out to VA-165 and, by the end of April 1970, the squadron

**An A-6C (Buto 155800) of VA-165 off USIS ANHERICA (VA-6A) heading towards a target in Vietnam loaded with 500 pound Mix R2 general purpose bombs during 1979. The Trails, Roads, Inchertic Multisensor (TRIM) system was housed in the ventral pod mounted under the fuselone centering. (JSR)**

had at least eight A-6Cs on hand. VA-165 deployed aboard USS ANHERICA during 1970 for its second WestPac cruise. The squadron launched its first A-6C strike mission in May of 1970 and flew approximately 675 A-6C combat sortis between 26 May and 7 November 1970. VA-145 serving about US RANGE (CVA-6A) was given five A-6Cs by VA-165 when US RANGE arrived on station in Southeast Asia during November of 1970. In West during this period that one A-6C was lost. BuNo 155647 planned into the set following a cold extent on 8 January 1971. The BombunderNaNaviagher (BW) was rescued, but the pilot was lost.

The A-6C was also operated by VA-3A board the USSA MERICA (VA-6C) during 1972.

\(\gamma\)-3A-5 Partners employed the technique of using the A-6C as a stabilized laser designator.

The technique involved acquiring a target via radar for Forward Loosline Harted (FLIR). After a target was identified the laser would be used to illuminate the target of opportunity for a BN in an accompanying A-6 (equipped with Texas Instruments M8 2Paveway 1,500 pound LOBs). The second A-6 would release its bombs on the illuminated target.

VA-3A-2B Blue Blueers, VA-75 Sandy Panches and VA-176 Thunderbolts all used the A-6C while they were in the fleet inventory. The A-6C remained in the fleet until late 1975, after which the remaining eleven were brought up to the latest strike configuration, either at a Navy Air Rewault Facility or at the Communa Plant on Long Island, New York.

**The TRIM sensor pod was attached to the fuselone centering station, which did reduce the bomb carrying capability of the A-6C somewhat. This A-6A was used to test the pod before it was fitted to a fully reconfigured A-6C (the aircraft was later converted to the KA-60 tanker configuration). The chevron on the tail was Dark blue outlined in White and the test probe on the none was Red and White striped. (Grumman)**KA-6D

The KA-6D is an air refreshing tanker version of the A-6A. It differs from the A-6A in that the all weather avionics had been removed and replaced with reteluing equipment. The bird-cage equipment by area in the rear fuselage was used to house the refetching house and droge, The KA-6D does retain the capability to be employed as a daylight bother. At one time plans were made to equip the KA-6D with four 200at cameras in the nose, however, this idea was dropped because of a lack of funding.

The first four further markers were converted from high time (A-6A's and on 16 April 1970 Chuck Sewell completed the first flight in a production tanker (Bulco 151582). After the first four KA-6D were completed, the KA-6D conversion program moved to Grumman's facility in Stuart, Florida.

The feasibility of using the A-6 as an air-to-air refueling tanker was demonstrated during April 1966, but it was not until the Summer of 1970 that the Navy began to procure the KA-6D mixer in uniformly, Grumman utilized the Sargent-Fletcher and droge design kit named to the A-6 to convince the Navy that the tanker could fulfill the Navy's requirement for a tanker to replace the KA-3.3. The fuel supply of the KA-6D is contained in tanks located at the wing and fuselage, a approved by the 300 500 gallum external term tanks for a total of 3,844 gallous of fuel, of which approximately 3,000 gallous are transferable. The KA-6D can also carry a McDommell Douglas D-704 "Budky" reflecting stone in place of the centerline 300 gallon tank.

Later, Grumman introduced the KA-6D conversion line at its Saint Augitime plant for Florida for an update program that includes five aircraft receiving arier, replacement of thermal tanks.

The second KA-6D prototype was converted from an A-6A and underwent testing at the Naval Air Test Center, NAS Patrun River, Maryland during March of 1973. The refueling droge and hose reel was housed in the equipment by area of the A-6A with a large fan-ing housing the droge. The aircraft had the experimental designation NA-6A stenciled on the fuselage in yellow. (Uloen Paul)

(Target Recognition Attack Multisensor)

A-6E BaNo 155673 had the distinction of being the first Intruder to fly with the TRAM system on 22 March 1974 at Calverton, Long Island. Fully integrated tests, however, did not commence until October of that same year. With the incorporation of TRAM system, the A-6E became the most advanced, electro-optically equipped attack aircraft in the world. TRAM presents television-type imagery of non-visual and/or non-hard significant targets, permits autonomous laser guided weapon delivery and offers more precise target discrimination during the terminal phase of an attack. By integrating Forward Looking Infrared (PLIR) laser sensors with the multimode search radar for identification, tracking and merging, the A-6E TRAM has the ability to detect, identify and attack may different types of targets under all combinations of daylight or adverse weather conditions with a higher degree of accuracy than ever before.

The incorporating of the Carrier Inertial Navigation System (CAINS),which is also common to Optimum's F-1d, increases the reliability and maintainability of the A-6E. The new systems that have been integrated into the A-6E TRAM made it possible to eliminate the need for uniquely configured traders such as the A-6B and A-6C.

The first fleet aircraft to have the full TRAM capability was an A-6E CLIFO (BuNo

**Grummer's A-6E TRAM prototype (Iphoto 155672) carried a special color scheme of overall Gloss White with Red and Blue stripes on the fuselage and Red and Blue bands around the wing and stability pres. The TRAM turet was installed under the radome and the TRAM logo on the fus was held.(Portmann)**

15571010 was delivered to VA-42 at NAS Oocana on 1 December 1978 and the first new built A-6E TRAM (BuNo 160995) was also delivered to VA-42 at 01 December 1978. The A-6E TRAM currently serves with all Navy Medium Attack Solutions. The five Marine All-Weather Attack Solutions operated the A-6E TRAM until the Spring of 1993.

The A-6E TRAM differs externally from the standard A-6E by the addition of a Detection and Ranging Set (DRS) pure installed under the radome forward of the nose landing gear well. Another external change is the addition of a large ram air intake on top of the fuselage offset to port near the leading edge of the vertical stabilizer.

A-6e TRAM Composite Wing

The A-6 Replacement Wing program was established by the Navy to correct a wing fatigue problem which was limiting the service life of the A-6 fleet and to increase its strength capability for an anticipated follow-on model, the A-6F. The existing A-6E wing was rebuilt using high technology composite materials as a method of maintaining the wing's existing weight while gaining additional load carrying capability and service life for the current A-6 fleet. The A-6 Replacement Wing program is intended to extend the life of the current A-6 fleet until an appropriate replacement is introduced into service.

During the early 1970s it was recognized that the Navy fleet of approximately 339 A-6Es needed a wing rebuild program to maintain this important component of the Navy's Air Arm. The Navy, however, had experienced some fly percent less fatigue life with the next wing than they expected and the program was delayed. During 1985 N, vary, an invitation for Bild (IFR) awarded Boe Millary Airplanes (BMA) a contract to provide new wings for the Bidding A-6E fleet.

Being proposed a wing constructed primarily of graph/epoxy composite materials, which would be both lighter and stronger than the current all metal wing. This was accepted and the first production composite wing was delivered during May of 1988. The first A-6E fleet air is central modified with the new wing was BaNo 155682, which made its first flight on 3 April 1989.

The wing fold mechanism and the number 5 pylon of an A-6E TRAM Composite Wing. The new wing permits the flags and sets to be operated with the wings are in the folded position, permitting below deck maintenance of these systems. Earlier A-6E had to have the wings spread in order to perform maintenance on the stats and flags. (Author)

The new composite wing significantly improves the performance, survivability and service life of the A-6. The wing provides for an eighteen percent increase in gross weight capability, is equipped with a new outboard self-defense weapon (air-to-air inside) station, ALR-67 wingior provisions, split center-wing fuel cell (which will enhance survivability), more accurate fuel-gaiping components, corrosion-resistant wing materials, flaps and stats that operate with the wing folded for below deck maintenance and an 80000 service life.

On 27 September 1993, the Navy announced that it was canceling the contracts with Boeing and Gruman for the composite wing program

## Appendix A-6e Swipt

The A-6E SWIP is the designation applied to A-6Es with standoff weapons capability. These aircraft are wired to carry and fire the AGM-65E/F Mawerick, AGM-84 Hapron, AGM-88 HARM and AGM-84E SLAT. These A-6Es have a fully digital missile free control system and other internal improvements. It was intended that A-6E SWIP aircraft would have the new composite wing; however, delays in the new program have led to three sib positions within the program: 4-6E SWIP (with metal wing), A-6E SWIP Block 1 (with composite wing) and A-6E SWIP Block 1 (with multi-power being). A-6E SWIP Block 1 (with multi-power being) and A-6E SWIP Block 1 (as aircraft with which will also have the composite wing. The first A-6E SWIP Block 1A aircraft is expected to fly during early 1994 and will incorporate the ASN-139 INS, ARN-118 TACAN, GPS system and a new headup display (HUD).

The piston on the number one stores station is quite different from those used on standard A-6Es and has a bulge on the outboard side. (Boeing)**The A-GF Intruder prototype (BuNo 162183) made its maiden flight on 26 August 1987 at the Naval Air Facility, Calverton, Long Island. The A-GF was to be the most advanced all-weather attack aircraft the Navy and the Marines had ever flown. It was to be powered by two 10,080 but F-404-GF-404 engines that provided a fifteen percent increase in power over the current Part and Winney engines (more than enough thrust to compensate for the extra weight of the A-GF-s improvements).

The A-GF was to incorporate an improved dark wind shinyer resolution, longer range and additional modes of operation (including an air-to-air mode for self defenses). The new air-to-air radar capability would have enabled the crew to track airborne targets and launch missiles such as the A-M-9 Sidewaller and the A-M-120 Advanced Medium-Range Air-to-Air Missile (AMRA). These missiles were to be carried on two new wing stations, one on each wing.

Although the A-GF locked similar to the A-GE RTA it differed from the earlier aircraft in a number of ways. The Central Electric F-404 engines necessitated deeper engine necelices, a reduction in size of the radar antennas made it possible to use a smaller radome and there were a number of new events and air scopes, including two large ram air intake ducts for the electronics compartment just forward of the vertical stabilizer. There are ECM receivers mounted above the wing fuel tank overboard vents (which was incorporated into the A-6E SWIP). Unfortunately with various defense cutbacks, the A-6F program was cancelled during 1988.

The number 2 A-GF prototype (BuNo 162184) was suspended in the Grumman Cavetron anechic chamber for electronic systems testing during 1987. The enlarged engine bays housed 10,700 host smokesan General Electric F-404-GE-404 turban engines, giving the A-AF a considerable increase in available power. The aircraft carries a HRAM missile on the inboard python and a dummy All-9 Sidewaller on the new outboard self-detense pylon. (Grumman)Electronic Intruders

### EA-6A INTRDER

The EA-6A was the first electronic warfant of the A-6A and was originally identified as the 2A-H.I.I. New Scherer was the Project Engineer that breached the concept of an Intruder controller with a integrated set of electronic systems capable of jamming energy radars. Active work on this project began in August of 1961 and the prototype (June 1968) has made its first night on 26 April 1963. The second AP-18 test aircraft (BwnN 147686) had a number of aerodynamic changes, the most prominent being the filter electronics failing on the until. This was necessary to accommodate some of the thirty antennas used in the ANA/Q-86 receiver/surveillance system, the ANA/Q-41 I and 2-band track breaker and the ANA/Q-86 receiver. A third, which is the ring up speed brakes were also omitted and an eight inch plus was added behind the randome to accommodate the new ECM installation. A considerable amount of the circuit countermeasures (ECM) equipment was pond mounted on the underlying vibrates. The wing mounted ANA/Q-76 spots, which are the primary jammers, are supplemented by an ANA/Q-45 communications jammer. This system radiates through a large blade antenna mounted on the two gear door.

The EA-6A also employs a shelf digged structure at the jets countermeasures shaft to discern energy molars. The shelf is dropped from two chutest leaders side by side in the bottom of the "bridge" at equipment rack. Additional chart designers are pod mounted on the outer wing plokes. The chuff diggers incur located in the at equipment rack was also capable of

**This on-China Lake EA-6A test aircraft was at NAS Labehurst, New Jersey during March of 1973 to be in equatorial tests at the Labehurst and based catight facility. The aircraft was designed to make EA-6A. The hight might then the aircraft cannot be modified, the Bureau Number is suspect since Human's Aircraft Location Report of 1984 listed this aircraft as an administrative strike (write off) and identified it as a standard A-6A (Roger Beeceece)**The EA-6A proved its effectiveness during the Viet Nam War and played a vital role in the history of aerial electronic warfare. It became readily apparent; however, that to keep pace with the increasing electronic warfare countermeasures built; more equipment, space and systems operators, would require a totally new aircraft.

EA-6B Proxler Standard

The first EA-6B was built from the fifteenth A-6A (BuNo 149481) produced by Grumman. This flying demonstrator took to be at an \(25\) May 1968 plahed by Grumman test pilot Don King, and served us an aerodynamic test bed. The second prototype designed an NEA-6B (BuNo 149479) was converted from the thineeth A-6A produced by Grumman and was used mainly in systems flight trials. The third NE-6A-6B (BuNo 148615) was another rebuilt A-6A and was used as the static electronic test aircraft. It spent a considerable amount of time in the uncubic chamber chamber at Grumman's Calvetron facility as a test bed for the tactical jamming system.

Grumman then produced five pre-production aircraft (BuNo 156478-156482) between April 1998 and March of 1970. On these, 156478 (BuNo 156478-156482) have been stitched from the inventory, and BuNo 156482 had the distinction of being designated as the Advanced Quality (ADVACY) development aircraft. Grumman produced twenty-three EA-6A Standard models between January 1971 and November of 1972 -- Bureau Numbers 18509-18500, 18540-18547 and 18560-18561.

The fourth pre-production (EA-6B Proxler (BuNo 156489)) on the ramp at the Naval Air Test Center. NAS Pattenar River, Maryland during entry 1971. The aircraft carried the designation of an the top of the order. The pilot access step was in the down position as was the port boarding ladder. (USR)

The EA-6B Standard differed from the earlier EA-6A in a number of ways. It had a longer fuseluge with a fully-for-inch fuseluge extension added to accommodate an enlarged cockpit for its four member crew. In addition, the nose gear and the main gear was strengthened, as was the ill wood rotus. A new injured slot and a modified wing to fuseluge filter was also added to the wing and the aircraft had a slightly smaller random.

The first flort standard EA-6Bs, named the Proxler by Grumman, went to VAQ-132 during 1971 while VAQ-136 received the last standard EA-6Bs during March of 1977. All EA-6B Standards, exclusive of the eight that were sixteen from the inventory were later rebuilt to ICAP configuration. The long range plan was to upgrade all EA-6Bs to the current model; however, budget constraints have made its slow process.

EA-6B Proxler EXCAP

(Expanded Capability)

Even though the EA-6B EXCAP doubles the frequency capability of the EA-6B Standard, it is externally identical to the earlier variant. Twenty-five EXCAPs were built -- Busnos 155rapy - 158817 and 159582-159587. The EXCAP was re-engled with more detail benefit, 11,200 lost 1352-408 engines in place of the earlier 39.50 1852-28. An engines.

VQA-133 Winarcal was the first solution to receive EA-6B EXCAP variant of the Proxler, making their finalen cruise about US AMERIC (CV-66) beginning in January of 1974. Other EXCAP versions of the EA-6B served with VQA-129, 131, 132, 134, 137 and 138. VQA-133 was the last Proxler squadron to employ the EXCAP model.

## EA-6B Prowler ICAP I (Improved Capability)

The major internal difference between the ICAP and ECACAP variants of the EA-6B Prowler involved moving the ALQ-99 system to the back seat and changing the duties of the electronic countermeasure officer from ECM to navigator-co-pilot. Another very important change was a more logical arrangement of crew member responsibilities among the four men's. The pilot's cockpit displays were also modified. Forty-five Prowlers -- BusNo 159907-159912, 16033-160437, 160409, 160704-160709, 160786-160791, 161115-161120, 161242-161247, 161347-161327 and 16174-161775 were built to the IACP configuration. The ICAP I joined the fleet in March of 1976.

Externally there were two main differences between the EA-6B ICAP and the EA-6B EXCAP, namely the location of the AN/ALQ-126 receiver antennas. One is located in the "survot" protrusion at the base of the prefining probe and the other is located in a small ("bever" can" shaped extension or rear of the flip ICAP command). The ER-6B ICAP (BuNo 159907) made its first flight in July of 1975. VAQ-135 was the first squadron to take the ICAP to sea, judging with CNP's during 1977 aboard the USS NMTIZ (CVN-6S). Ten squadron received ICAP-aircraft, VAQ-129, 130, 131, 132, 134, 135, 136, 138, 139 and one Marine Corps squadron, VMA-2.

## EA-6B ICAP II

(Improved Capability II)

The first production sample of the ICAP II variant was BWs 161776, which was delivered to the Naval Air Test Center (NATC) at NAS Pattenar River, Maryland during late 1983. The ALQ-99 beds were crowded to incorporate new screens which enabled each of the ponds to jam no different bands. Forty-one of the ICAP IIs were built, Bows 16176-161885, 162230, 16234-16239, 163030-163035, 163044-16309 and 163357-16339. In addition fifteen EXCAP variants were updated to ICAP II standards.

Two very significant add-ons to the Pro Fowler came one line with the introduction of the ICAP II. Starting with the thirteen ICAP II production model (BWs 162225) the Pro Fowler was given the capability to act in concert with other Provers to provide a joint jamming capability using the technical air navigation system (TACAN) antenna for coordinated jamming. ICAP II Provers can also carry the Texas Instruments ACM-88A High Speed Anti-Radiation missile (IARM). This was the first Pro Fowler variant to be amred.

Starting with BWs 162609 there are swept-back antennas were added, two are located on top of the fuselage and the third is positioned under the nose. The ventral Doppler radar antennas located on the underscale of the rear fuselage was also eliminated.
