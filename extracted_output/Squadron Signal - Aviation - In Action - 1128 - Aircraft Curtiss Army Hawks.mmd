## Introduction

With aviation enthusiasts, some things never change. Mention jet fighters and (depending on the time period) enthusiasts will automatically think of \(\sim\) Legs, Phantons or Sabres. Talk about propeller driven fighters and you'll hear about Mustangs, Spitters, and Messersenths. But bring up the subject of U.S. Army Air Corps bijanget "Powits" and the conversation will usually turn to Curtis Hawks. For it was the Curtis Hawks, more than any other Army aircraft, that captured the imagination of the public during the 1920s and 1930s.

The Hawks wasn't the fastest or most maneuverable fighter of the period, but it did have something no other pursuit of the time had \(\sim\) pensaility Plain and simple, it "looked" right. It had the steel, aggressive look that the public of it paruit Justin she should have. The Hawks, and their Falcon derivatives, kept the Curtis Aerophea and Motor Company absent through the Depression and lamb budgets of the 1930s. This, turn, enabled Curtis to build the more potent Hawks that fought on all fronts in the Second World War.

Few people realize the impact that Glenn Hammond Curtis had on aviation history. Although the Wright Brothers are credited with the invention of the airplane, Glenn Curtis is credited with several of the significant developments that led to the modern military aircraft. As a member of Alexander Graham Bell's Aerial Experiment Association, Curtis developed engines to be used for various fing machines. His own aircraft, named _Law Big_, first one from 2 Jan 1908. Later that same year controls modified the aircraft with a set of options, making it the first attempts at seaplane. In August 1990 the Curtis _Golden Flow_ beat the Wright Brothers entry in the Bordeau Bennett tropy race. In June of 1910 Curtis conducted the first successful aerial attack against a military warship; although, the significance of this event (and Billy Mitchell's later demonstrations) would be ignored until 7 December 1941.

On 14 November 1910, Glenn Curtis makes an even more significant demonstration when the _Golden Fly_ made the first successful launch from a U.S. warship. The first
**Ski-equipped PW-s**s**s **of the 1st Purvati Group prepare for a fight from Settings Field, Michigan, to 10000s, Michigan tertiary 192s. The steps in the up-step range were tested for the main-rounded readers. The new radios were a constant source of trouble. (APN) Adding insult to injury, Army LT Russell Maughan set at a new Absolute World Speed Record in an R-6 at 248.5 mph. Curtiss races dominated the air racing scene and it was small until 150xhata across children(fowler(fowler)) emerged. That race was the last to see a pure racing design entered more the Curtis name. During 1923, Curtis began work on the aircraft that led to the Curtis Hask family. The new pursuit ship was a direct development of the Curtis R2C/R3C racing aircraft program. Powered by a 440 h Curtis D1-2 engine, the XPW3. (Experimental Purvati Water-cooled design from 87 h8 fire flung damage of 1923. Its true state similar in appearance to the rare, but the XPW3-was much larger and the wings was in a standard position above the upper fuselage. The radiators we were faced in detail in detail in that they were flush-mounted on the upper wing surface directly in front of the pilot to reduce the Radiator and welding technology being what it was in the early 1920s, those flush-mounted radiators were a constant source of problems. They leaked often, obscuring the pilot with boiling water.

Being impressed with the performance of the Curtiss races, and recognizing the close to between the new pursuit ship and the race,the Army ordered twenty-five air start under the designant PW-s in September 1923. LT Russell Maughan used one of the first production PW-s to set a new trans-continental speed record during June of 1924. A new company was fast emerging in the military aircraft field - Boeing In April of 1923 being unveiled with ZWP-s. Powered by the same Curtiss D1-2 engine as the PW-s, the Boeing pursuits ANN might luther, that the single leading and trailingless tapered and had the radiator mounted vertically under the nose in a tunnel. A flyer between the XPW-9 and a production PW-s during 1924 resulted in a clear win for the Boeing aircraft. It was more maneuverable and had a greater rate of climb, mostly due to its lighter weight. As a result, Boeing was given a contract to build thirty PW-s. Curtiss immediately adopted the turn indicator in its followon aircraft, the XPW-8A The production PW-sA was powered by the same Curtiss D1-22 rated at 440 bp. The top speed speed was 178 mph at least, with a rate of climb of 183.01 from 14.502 to 17.200 feet. Armanment was the same as the PW-s, a pair of 30.0 caliber machine guns mounted above the engine in the coiling. The weight of the PW-sA was 2830 pounds, some 900 pounds lighter than the PW-s with its flush-mounted radiators. To improve the aircraft's maneuverability, Curtiss located that the answer was to the Boeing-developed tapered, this photography of the Boeing was a model. Curtiss engineers came up with a stepped wing of their own. By December of 1924, Curtis had another XPW-8A with a short-span, tapered wing. The results of flightlets with the XPW-8B were very positive and the Army ordered the next tapered-wing design into production. One other change would take place prior to production. During 1926, the USA. Armar Service then, the USA. Armar Service then, the USA. Armar Services and aircraft designations were changed. The first aircraft ordered into production for the new Army Air Corps was the production variant of the XPW-8B, now designated the Curtis P-1, nicknamed the Hask.

**I Physical Haughan set a new transform-continental speed record of 21 hours 58 minutes on 23 June 1924 in this PW-8. It marked the first time that the continental United States had been crossed in less than a day. (APN)**P-1 Hawk

The Army issued Curtis a contract in 1926 to build fifteen production variants of the SW-88 under the designation P-1. the first was given the trade name "Hawk" by Curtis and this son son again on, becoming the popular name for the aircraft as well. When the Army Air Service became the Army Air Corps in 1926, the PW designation was dropped with all fighter-type aircraft becoming simply P (for Pavani). The only difference between the prototype XPW-8B and the P-1 was in the under balance area. The P-1 was proven by an 1.1500 whole inch, a 4.5 h/s, Curtis D-12 time, liquid cooled using (Armey designation V-150-150); giving the aircraft at a top speed of 160 mph at sea level, a rate of climb of 1800 to/min and a service ceiling of 220,000 feet. The maximum consisted of eight apart 3.0 d/s called machine gas mounted in the upper and fine through the propeller arc. The aircraft could also be configured with either affy fashioned transducer fuse fuel tank or 200 pound bound load. With a full load of fuel and ammunition, the aircraft had a gross weight of 2.846 pounds. Although the Army ordered fifteen P-1 Hawks, only ten were delivered as P-1s (serials 2-510 through 24-519), the hirst stream to the contract being completed as P-1 Hawks. Navy interest in the Army Hawk resulted in a contract for nine aircraft under the designation P-1. When we literally copies of the Army P-1 Hawk. The first production P-1 Hawk was delivered to the Air Service test center at McCok Field in July of 1925 and the first operational aircraft went to the 1st Pursuit Group at Selfridge Field (near Detroit), Michigan in October of 1925.

### P-1a

The P-1A differed from the P-1 in having the internal fuselage structure lengthened three inches, resulting in an overall increase in the aircraft's length of one inch. Additionally, the fuel system was improved, as was the bomb release mechanism. The Army ordered twenty-five of these improved Hawks on 9 September 1925. Curtis delivered the first production P-1A to the 1st Pursuit Group at Selfridge in April of 1926. Only twenty-three P-1A were delivered from the original contract, since two aircraft were pulled of the Curtis assembly line and finished as the AT-4 Advanced Trainer prototype and P-3 prototype.

### P-1b

The P-1B incorporated a new engine, the improved Curtis V-150-3 in-line engine, which was a more reliable power plant but offered no increase in available horsepower. The P-1B also had the radiator and radiator housing redesigned, larger wheels and improved engine/flight control systems. These changes increased the empty weight by almost 100 pounds. With nois noiseness in available engine power, the top speed of the P-1B fell 150 mph at sea level. More importantly, the rate of climb dropped from 1.810/min to 1.540/min. The Army ordered twenty-five P-1B in August of 1926 with the first production aircraft being delivered in November of 1926 to the Air Corps Detachment at Bolling Field, Washington, D.C.

P-1C

The P-1C used the V-1150-5 engine, which made improvements in engine reliability, with no increase in horse power. The P-1C had a narrower nose section, tapered traidator, larger and heavier wheels and tries and mechanical brakes. Empty weight increased another 50 pounds and with this increase the P-1C's top speed decreased to 154 mph, while the rate of climb fell to 1.460 R/min. The Army ordered thirty-three P-1C's in October of 1928 with the first aircraft being delivered to the 1st Pursuit Group at Selfridge in January of 1929.

**AT-4/P-1D**

The Army decided that a first fine pursuit aircraft fitted with a lower horsepower engine would be ideal to fill the advanced trainer role. As result of this decision, P-1A's air air was pulled off the Curtis assembly line and re-engued in a 1800 Brison \(\frac{1}{2}\) engine, license-busibility with prioritized the designation V-2M. The aircraft was standard P-1A's airframe, without weapons, and the reduced power resulted in a top speed of 132 mph.

Even with this poor performance, the Army ordered forty of these advanced trainer aircraft, under the designation AT-4. With the exception of the engine and the lack of armament, the AT-4 was identified in the P-1A.

The Army soon realized that the AT-4 was totally unsuitable for the trainer role, protection aircraft began to reach the chosen initial s Kelly Field in May of 1927 and was quickly obvious that the performance of the AT-4 was misersersersly lacking in all areas. In fact, the aircraft was quite dangerous in the hands of a student laptop. In 1928, Army ordered thirty-five out of the forty AT-4s reigned with the 350 Curtis V-1150-5 engine the same engine used in the P-1B. This problem performance up to a level of 10 that of the other harb pursuits from the service. The reengued AT-4s armed with a single 30 caliber machine gun, were re-designated as P-IDs.

**AT-5/P-1E**

The last five aircraft were refitted with 2020 Brison \(\frac{1}{2}\)-700-1 radial engines and re-designated as AT-5s. Although the available power was increased by forty horse power over the Wright's engine, the performance of the AT-5 actually fell off even more,

**An overall One One P-1A Raw of the 71D Pursuit Squadron based at Selfridge Field, Michigan during 1924. The P-1 Raw, featured a tapered wing and tumbler.** It was the first Curtis Buffer to carry the trade name fault, which later became accepted as the popular name for the aircraft as well. (APM) with the top speed falling to 125 mph. The Army had Curtis re-engine four of the AT-5s with 435 by V-1150-5 engines, re-designating the aircraft as P-1E.

**AT-5/P-1F**

The P-1F was a similar conversion of some thirty-five production AT-5A advanced trainers. The AT-5A was powered by 220 hB-700-1 radial engines and is a tailframe had been brought up-P-1B installers with larger busers, busers and improved engine controls. With this added weight, the performance of the AT-5A sadd, with the top speed dropping to 122 mph. Deliveries of the AT-5A to Reifield school weapons began in June of 1928. During 1926, however, the Army ordered the thirty-five at AT-5s that had been delivered re-engued with the 435 by V-1150-5 engine and armed with one 30 cal gun. Once the conversion was complete, the aircraft were re-designated as P-1F.

**P-2**

The last five aircraft on the original Army-1 contract were built with highly modified engines under the designation P-2 Brave. The V-1150-1 engines were bowed out to a displacement of 1400 cubic inches and fitted with supercharges giving the engine a rating of 505 b. With this increase in power, the P-2 had to stop speed of 172 mph and a rate of climb of 2170 R/min. The supercharge range the P-2 a service ceiling of 2400 feet, however, problems with the new superdiameter cancelled the advantages of the increase in performance. A result, the Army had three of the P-1A-spending with standard V-1150-1 engines and redesignated them as P-1A. One of the remaining P-2s later became the prototype for the P-6 series.

**P-3**

The last P-1A from the initial production run was modified to accept a new 410 hp The Curtiss 435 bD-12 (P-1150-1) water cooled, inline engine, powered both the P-1 Hawk series and the factor 4 P-1 Falcone of aircraft. The multipole in the front of the engine was the same flag for the rotator and the oval intake in the middle was the contributor at intake. (APM)Pratt & Whitney R-1340 'Wasp' air-cooled radial engine. Designated the XP-3A, the radial-engine Hawk was used as an engine test bed throughout its service life. The combination of the high air-cooled radial engine and Hawk airframe would later prove to be a very good one -- for the Navy? The Alma was committed to the use of the liquid-cooled, heavier V-12 engine in its Hawks. The simpler and easier to maintain Pratt & Whitney Wasp radial was perfector the Navy and three procured a large number of radial engined Curtis Hawks for the fleet.

Powered by the 410B Pratt & Whitney R-1340-339. The W-3A Hawk had a 90 speed of 154 mph and a rate of climb of 1,742 U/min, neither of which was better than the D-12 powered Hawk in ten service. The service ceiling did improve by almost 2,000 feet to 2000 feet. But further degraded against use of the radial engine for Hawks. The 29-A/s did see operational service with all five being delivered to the 1st Pursuit Group at Selfridge Field in October of 1928.

### P-5

There were five P-5 Hawks built by Curtis during 1928. These aircraft were basically P-18s powered by a 435 hp turbos-supercharged Curtis D-12F engine (V-1150-3). The addition of the turbo-supercharged brush the gross weight of the P-5 up to 3,499 pounds, some 500 pounds more than a P-1 Hawk. Additionally, the turbo-supercharged added nothing but during at least five minutes. The scale level for the P-5 was 42 mph, but the speed at a distance significantly to a rather phenomenized 173 mph at 425,000 feet. The rate of climb was poor, being only 1,1500 mph, although the service ceiling greatly improved. The P-5 had ceiling of 31,000 feet, hence that 1000 feet above the P-1A. Clearly the turbo-supercharged offer significant improvements in performance at altitude, although its numerous technical problems killed the 5- and the program was halted after the delivery of the five production aircraft in 1928.

## Xp-6

The prototype XP-6 Haw started life as the fourth production P-2 airframe. The aircraft was returned to the Curtis Garden City, New Jersey plant and re-engined with the new 600 h Digital good (or line-time Curtiss V-1570) "Conquerquer" engine to allow the aircraft to compete in the 1972 National Air Races. The contract for the XP-6 prototype was left in April of 1972, although work actually started some weeks earlier.

When the aircraft emerged, it was similar in appearance to all the previous Hawk variants; in fact, very little had been changed to the rear of the fuseling engine firewall. The changes were all performed around the engine and radiator installation. The XP-6 was in the target in the 1972 National Air Race, placing second to what amounted to a purpose with racing aircraft. The XP-6, shown by TA JX Lyon, averaged 18 mph while the purpose built racing aircraft that beat the XP-6 averaged 201 mph. That aircraft was the Curtis XP-6.

After the race, the XP-6 was returned to Wright Field and assigned the test number XP-49. Reached with a 252 W- US7150-engine and fitted with military equipment, the aircraft was calculated as a new pursuit aircraft. The XP-6 had a top speed of 176 mph, a rate of climb of 2.277 mph and a service ceiling of 23.10 feet.

The winner of race, the XP-6, was built using several different Curtiss aircraft as a basis. The wishes was that of a P-1A flask which was re-engined with one of the new 600 h Engineering engines, boosted to some 370 h for racing. The engine was cooled in the 4P-S engine cooling and the tunnel radiator at hot housing was discarded in favor of the untapered wings and flush-mounted radiators of the XPW-8A. The result was an aircraft that was aerodynamically smoother than the other Hawks. Powered by the higher horsepower Computer engine, the XP-6A, down by LT Earl G. Batten early can away from its 1972 competition becoming the first U.S. Army Air Corps aircraft to break the 200 mph barrier (average speed 201 mph).

## P-6

Satisfied with the results of the 1972 National Air Race and the showing made by a virtually bound ready aircraft, the XP-6, the Zmmry ordered the P-6 into production on 3 October 1928. Powered by the 600 h 1570-17 engine, the P-6 looked like a P-1A with a deeper, more rounded nose. This change in profile was because the Conquer was a larger engine and required a larger rotator for engine cooling. The Army left future development of the P-6 with the development of a new cooling liquid called Prescino coolant. Prescino (ethylene glycol) was better cooling agent than water because it had both a lower freezing and higher boiling point than water. Prescino development, however, was lagging and the Army decided to order the P-6 into production using a standard water radiator, which resulted in the color rounded forward fuselage contours.

The P-6 also differed from the earlier P-1 series in the landing gear. The P-6 used a strengthened fan faning gear that also pre-burned the forward landing gear start. This landing gear had been tested on the last two production P-ICs and was selected as standard equipment for the P-6 series.

Performance of the P-6 closely matched that of the XP-6 and the Army ordered a total of eighteen aircraft. The first production variant were delivered to the Wright Field Test Center at Dayton, Ohio. in October of 1929. Operations with the 1st Pursuit Group at Selfridge Field began a month later, in November of 1929.

The Army halted P-6 production after ten aircraft, ordering that the remaining eightan external on the production order becompleted with Prestone coolantradiators in placed the standard water radiator. Being a better coolant than water, less Prestone was required for engine cooling and as a result, a smaller radiator was needed on a Prestone-equipped aircraft. The Prestone-cooled aircraft retained the deep radiator housing of the P-e, even though the were equipped with a much smaller radiator. The last eight production aircraft with the Prestone radiators were designated as P-6s and delivered to the 1st Pursuit Group.

The XP-6s was a one-of-if-air straight spotlight specifically for long range record flights. The XP-6s was a P-iCifar (29-529) re-engined with a V-150-1 engine. The radiator housing resembled the housing on the P-6 but was much rounder in appearance. The biggest change was in the internal capacity which was increased from 59 gallons to Selfridge 25 gallons. CAPT hosts Royf the XP-6s named _Inf_ Softer System for Mitchell Field near New York City to Nomora, Alaska in thirty-four hours and twenty minutes (at time) on 18/19 July 1929. The XP-6s enabled during the current flight and was tracked back to Wright Field. After being repaired, the aircraft was retained at Wright Field for test work, being retired in August of 1931. No production aircraft carried the designations P-6B or P-6C.

## Appendix P-6D

Army interest in the turbo-supercharger once again surfaced with the P-6D Hawk. The first P-6A (29-260) was re-engined at Wright Field with a Curtis V-1570-23 engine fitted with a General Electric F-2P turbo-supercharger under the dissipation XP-6D. The turbo-supercharger was mounted on the starboard side of the nose with large oil cooler air intake/cahast ports on the port side. The exhaust system used a wrap-around exhaust manifold that channeled exhaust passes from the port side of the engine to the supercharger on the starboard side. After a series of successful tests, the Army ordered nine P-6 aircraft and three P-6A aircraft converted to P-6D standards, with the actual conversion work being undertaken by US. Army Air Corps depots.

As with the earlier P-5, sea level performance fell of. The aircraft had a top speed of 172 mph and rate of climb of 1,720 ft/min. Once again the service ceiling was dramatically improved, topping out at 32,000 feet and the speed at 13,000 feet rose to 197 mph. With a maximum weight of some 4,380 pounds, the P-6D was the heaviest P-6 variant. The P-6D Hawk was the third P-6D with a Hamilton Standard Tube blade wide wide pitch propeller in place of the Curtis two blade unit.

After service testing with the 37th Pursuit Squadron, 8th Pursuit Group at Langley Field, Virginia, a number of P-6s were used operationally with the 1st Pursuit Group at Solffing Field is high altitude filters. In any event, the turbo-supercharger proved to be unreliable and no further conversions or new production P-6Ds were produced. A number of P-6s remained in service until 1937, with the last aircraft being retired in April of 1938.
P-6E

The P-6E Hawk resulted from the mating of several features from different Curtis experimental programs. It began in October of 1930 when one of the bulbous P-6 air-frames was fitted with a 650 W Wright R-18790 Cyclone clinical engine in place of the standard Curtis Congour under the designation VP-20. The aircraft featured standard P-6e-loop-equivalent landing gear but the wheels were covered by aerodynamic wheel failures known as "spots". The VP-20 also had an enlarged rotator, as part-overoverable aerial wheel, improved cockpit layout and a linped rearstage controller to allow axes to the hugage compartment and rearstage for maintenance. Spectral performance with the Cyclone rail was slightly improved over the standard P-6e but not enough for the Army to justify putting the aircraft to production.

The second aircraft involved in development of the P-6E was the XP-22. The XP-22 used a P-6A airframe made at 600 W. P-1570-20. Converting one housed in an entirely reshaped engine working. The launch smaller P-6A radiator was moved to the rear and mounted it is on bus housing between a new style single-leg main landing gear. After a successful series of tests, the XP-22 was soon stripped of all its new features and put back into service as a production of 200 W.

Taking the best features of the two experimental aircraft, Curtis developed a new prototype under the designation XP-6E. The VP-20 wastage was extensively modified with a 600 W-1570-23. Connector engine replacing the Wright Cyclone rail. The engine cowings was patterned after the one used with the XP-22, including the smaller P-6A radiator mounted between the single-leg landing gear with full wheel pads.

The aircraft carried the standard Arm Corps fighter arrangement two 30-coliller machine guns, but the guns were now mounted under the engine cylinder heads, firing through troughs in the engine cowings. Additionally, the XP-6E featured an unsmoothed steerable tail wheel, revised horizontal tail surfaces and three blade Hamilton Standard variable pitch propeller. Along with all these changes, the XP-6E also underwent major switch reduction program and emerged some 412 pounds lighter than a standard P-6A (2,760 pounds).

The Army was very enthusicate about the XP-6E and ordered forty-six production P-6Es in July of 1931. Performance tests with the P-6E revealed that the aircraft was superior at all ways to either the P-6A or the supercharged P-6D. The two speed ways 198 mph at sea level, the rate of climb was 2,400 f/min and the service ceiling was 24,700 feet. Incompared favorably with signsy comparison, the floating P-12. The P-6E was faster at all altitudes but slower in rate of climb and less maneuverable. The reason for this difference was taken open here. The Boeing P-12 was powered by an air-cooled P-6A Whitney radial that was some 100 W lighter than the liquid cooled engine in the P-6E.

The first production P-6E was delivered to Wright Field out refusing with the remainder of the production run being delivered to the quadsuit of the 17th, 3rd and 95thuraiurai Sundararajan. Of these only the 17th was solely equipped with P-6Es. These aircraft remained on active service from the mid-1930s, although accidents destroyed at least twenty-seven of the forty-six aircraft built. Most service aircraft had modified landing gear sparts. The closed gusts cause problems when operating off time and grass fields in water weather of during the water. Mud and of our service would build up inside the system interfering with the wheels. A result, the outboard portion of the gust was removed, leaving the shot uncovered. Finally, the last eighteen octap-wise were inserted from service between June and September of 1930. Most were donated to civil schools as non-flying trailing aids.

Three other P-6A variants were produced using P-6E after cutting the XP-6F was an XP-6E Hawk with a turbo-supercharged P-6E engine and a sliding cockpit colony. Adams, in supercharger technology allowed the XP-6F to attain a top speed of 225 mph at 1500,000 feet. The internal remained active at Wright Field until October of 1937 when it was retired and donated to a aeronautical school.

The XP-6G was built from the 22nd production P-6E and saved an engine tested for development over no. PW-1570-2000. The P-6E with the first one of the 6th position of the 9th position the upper and lower was modified to allow for the installation of a pair of 30 other guns in each using, bringing the total moment to six 30.30 caliber guns. The aircraft was used by the NH Pursuit Group, but first Version and 17th Pursuit Group. With its increased armament, the XP-6H was the heaviest P-6H with a gross weight of 3,358 pounds. Its top speed was 190 mph and rate of climb was 2,000 f/min. The air-speed-22 was rebuilt from the third production P-6A. The modifications included single leg along, a close-coupled engine and small Presence indicator just in front of the main landing gear. (UM)craft was finally retired in July of 1939.

The final P-6E on the production contract became the XP-23 prototype and it bore little resemblance to any previous Hawk. The XP-23 had a completely new all-metal monocoque fuselage, which was very slender through the nose area, and taller all-metal fan and underdeter. The aircraft was powered by a 600-700 b turbo-superpedared and opened GI1-Y150-C, engine. The wings and landing gear were all that remained from its P-6E heritage. Once again performance a' attitude was outstanding, with a speed of 225 mph at 15,000 feet and a service ceiling of 33,000 feet. But rate of climb and sea level performance suffered. With the arrival of the monogenic fighter in the Boeing P-2, the Army Air Corps abandoned the XP-23 program. The XP-23 was finally disseminated and the wings and landing gear were used as the basis for the XF11C prototype for the Navy.

### Fuselage Development

The first production P-6E Hawk (32-232) sits on the ramp at Wright Field during late 1931. Although resembling the XP-23, the P-6E had a much thinner nose section and had the guns, relocated to the side of the nose. (Don Garrett, d.).

The two seat Falcon series was a parallel development of the Hawk fighter series. Basically all larger Hawk, the Falcon shared the same blood fatigue framework technology that was used with the Hawk. The Falcon and a PW-8/P-10 designer that was extended 5.5 feet to accommodate a second cockoff for a rear gunter observer. The wing platform differed from the Hawk in that the power wing was not tapered and had a greater span than the lower wing on the P-1 Hawk. The upper wing was moved forward and had a straight center section with the outer wing panels such box time degrees. The landing gear was the typical Curtis Hawk style in multi-futrin lamina lamp sera with a slid. Falcone were built as both observation and attack aircraft for the U.S. Army Air Corps.

### O-1

The O-1 Falcon evolved from a 1924 Army competition for a new observation aircraft. Originally powered by the First World War Libers engine, the XO-11ost out badly to the Douglas XO-2. The Army, however, really did not want a Liberty engaged aircraft, so another competition was set for 1925 esp requesting those of the new Packard L1.50W-12 liquid cooled engine as the power plant. The curtision was only and Curtis was awarded a production contract for ten O-1 aircraft. Additionally, the specified power plant was changed from the Packard engine to the 45LB Curtis V-1150 (12). Production Q-13 differed from the XO-11 having an enlarged vertical and no trade-check, the ramament consisted of a major flightelle. 30cular engine on a scarring in the observer's cocktail.

Two K-O-1 Falcon observation aircraft rolled out in 1924 compared by 8510 to produce 14-1500 liquid cooled engine. The O-1 Falcon was basically a larger Hawk, sharing the same hustage design, landing gear and engine as the P-1 Hawk series. (APR)

The O-1 known as the Falcon, had a gross weight of 4,400 pounds, almost 1,200 pounds more than a P-1 Hawk, although both used the same power plant. Performance tests showed that no speed of 136 mph, a rate of climb of 975 in (min) and a service ceiling of almost 16,000 feet. Deliveries of the ten production aircraft took place during 1925.

The O-13 Warsaw O-1 platform within the same improvements are P-1C Hawk; larger shelves, mechanical brakks, at fellestation device for the main fuel tank and the ability to carry a fifty-six pilot under fissions drop rate. The Army ordered forty-five D-18, with deliveries starting in 1927. Four minutes O-10-C8 were built for specific use as VIP transport aircraft and we assigned to very high ranking officers in the Army, including the Secretary of the Army.

The O-16 different from O-16 EK in having the V-1150-5 engine, Frese altera, elevator balance forms, shock absorbers on the main landing gear and a refined cowl engine. One O-15 experimentally fitted with a cockoff canopy were formed into other propoinsall 420 hp Liberty engines in O-1 airframes and issue these aircraft to National Guard units. The Liberty-engined O-1 prototype was designated the NO-11 and was followed by sixty-six production O-1s which used O-1B airframes powered by 435 hp Liberty 12A engines.

### A-3 Attack Falcon

A natural development of the Falcon series was its modification for use as an attack aircraft. The first attack Falcon was on U-18 airframe modified with a pair of 30 caliber machine passing installed in the lower wings and underwine bomb racks. The aircraft was powered by the Curtis V-1150-3 engine, giving the A-3 in top speed of 141 mph, a rate of climb of 1406 f/min and a service ceiling of almost 1600 ftC. Sixty-six A-3 Attack Falcon was operated by the Army during 127. Additionally, another AS-3 were built to fill the training mode. The aircraft and the maximum defender and had had fulfill controls. The Army ordered seven-eight A-3 Hack Falcon during 129. These aircraft had all the improvements found on the O-1E.

A least twenty Falcon stations were built by Curtis for civilian use as mailplanes and passenger aircraft. Most of these were powered by the 435 hp Liberty engine. National Air Transport bought between single-set railplanes while Pan American Grace Airways had a single Falcon powered by a Wright Cyclone radial engine.

Export military also caused a total of 135 aircraft. The O-18 aircraft served solo Columbia and then Puerto 1928. These research was done in the twelve between the two countries that took place between 1922 and 1944. Ten O-1Es were built in Chile and some of these were transferred to Brazil where they saw combat during 1932 against rebel forces. At least 100 O-1G airframes powered by 712 hp Wright Cyclone engines were purchased by Columbia. These aircraft were used on both wheeled landing gear and floats.

The O-1 differed from the P-1 series in that the wing platform was changed with the upper wing, outer wing panels swept back from a straight center section. [PM].

This Falcon was used by the Wright Aeronautical Corporation as a test bed for geared and turtle-supercharged Computer engine experimental work. The aircraft was originally built as a Liberty powered aircraft. (Unocent Bertrait)

Most export versions of the Falcon were powered by Wright Cyclone radial engines, including those sold to Columbia in 1932. The aircraft were equipped with floats and save combat during the 1932-34 war between Peru and Columbia.
