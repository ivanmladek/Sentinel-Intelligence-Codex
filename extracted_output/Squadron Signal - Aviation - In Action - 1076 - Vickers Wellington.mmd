By the time construction had begun the Air Mobility realized that the steam coded Geshawal, iemige was not fulfilling today serving promise and the specifications were again called, this time to induce an alternative powerset. The more powerful, but heavier 650 to Brussels retains time cylinder at once ended until some was installed.

JMI Summers fle the prototype (84048) for the first time the two (Videos main production plant, located in the corner of the famous Brookhastic racing track) submitted, London (Wiprocing). The further power was capable of fitting a bomboid to 4,500 pounds and had a range of 2,800 miles - quaduphing both of these performance approaches such as patient and the original specifications.

However, with the months a change was made to the much more fitting many of the world, and about the same time for all places in their full. In addition, the Atff Activity again created the basic specifications of the terms of 62936n February 1937. The actual was expected to perform the requirements for accomplishment - under the new thought. The Flat Anwamy currently describes those and was in order World Warf this policy still firmly worked in the context of digital control.

## WELLINGTON MK 1A

The Max 1A was on a direct line successor to the M.I., but was aware a design planned in accordance with ongoing the future M.I. These new marginal increases in the M.I.'s dimensions, the feature was marginally resolved by shocks and thus owing again increased by shocks. In order to improve the Center of Gravity on a fixed chain was moved toward these shocks.

During this work, it was difficult to develop beyond these general directions of the Volkes bursts came under critical scrutiny as a possible reason is to further use the units would be sufficiently efficient against the M.I. But in contrast to the current undertake survey. There was an initially a high degree of position for this process and a proper study of the required required motion calculator and resultant direct evidence of its failure in combat to the contrary ultimately posed by the wishes of RM's authorities and Fraser Nath Fish bursts were introduced. In contrast to the VIRES where most of which were obtained during apertures limited the pure resolution, the PRS rose and F1N that was purely completely mobile hydraulic. In contrast to this work, the VIRES data were completely split through the M.I.'s first version of this work, and then the fourth day an F1N that was inserted in a systematic mount.

The standard open on the standard design, which partly extended beyond the rear of the engine could, caused problems with lunar-etching or angular state-driven satellites (see the review of the VIRES data). The work done under the wings of the runs at various for moderate \(b\) to hold a board over the entire stick with white start-up fork. To create the system, the work done in the M.I.'s third version of this work, the second author was fitted. By contrast the open engine could be flow from the M.I.'s second second author the wing leading edge. The outer section of the front engine exhausted pulse was enclosed in a circular "null" with white past of the aircraft having system. The first three M.I.'s (R2866, 10286 and 102867) were delivered with hours before war was declared.

### Daylight Offensive

The first time the results of the work in Europe on the Western Front, because acting on the ground was almost one-times, because known as the Proxy Air, However, there was no strong _Proxy_ about the near half. We have observed two stars and the British Quadrics of Shrienships with \(-\) the filter shown from the results of 19 and 20 Sudarons - carried at a bright end in the German Waveport site with \(-\) the filter shown in Figure 1.

**Algorithm 1**: The _Navigation_ in these early days was by deduced or "dead recknowing" with the navigator using ground references and or, as a smart with which to navigate by the stars. These navigation methods were adequate so so long as the weather was clear, which was not certain. With all other undesirable anxiety, at least on the part of the politicians and the Air Ministry, Honor Command aircraft were obstructed individually to targets and drivers were still located specifically to be bound within a German city, and define penalties were treated on any terrain which attacked anything but clearly defined military objective - at least this case due to the time when the United debate began the campaign of both-privacy heart in cities incident.

Because of these flight together water the Worldtown Australia, I was fitted with fourteen nightside looking again within the bottom-day orbit which were to be inflated prior to difficating, allowing the Wellington to better withstand the shock of hitting the water and remain dated, the bottom door were retained in the closed location.

## Wellington Mk IC

Differing Illie from the Mk IA, the knowledge of the Wellington Mk IC was slightly cut down behind the noise turned unchanged for total three three tenetural greater traverse. By contrast the same area on the Mk IA fit with the turn frame. While this modification had the advantage of greater travel, mobility \(\leq\) created turbulence when the travel was fully traversed and produced into the dispersion. The third velocity K's come were introduced into beam conditions at the multipath band and the wing during edge, however, after this was carried out with the Mk IA PA21, the vibrates guns were replaced by best-fed/forming.303 moung guns, with neither being located further at it. In the event both can convince we see to see on both Mk IA and ICA.

Although available records are somewhat vague it appears that the Wellington Mk IC was the first Wimpf fitted with the Lorenz third landing beam that featured a horizontal receiving serial mounted under under heading slightly the height of the other. While Mk IC was even equipped with the Lorenz third landing equipment, it is that we have at least to keep between retro-fitted with the receivers. It is a tensioned hydraulic system using VGS pumps was installed along with a twenty-four volt electrical system needed to operate the Directional Radio Compass.

Pegasas XVII engines were proving to be a generally reliable powerprint, at least when both engines have recording: however, loss of power can engine, when combined with a surprising ability to handle the Del Protoplasts, created an air at too often inevitable loss of height.

The Wellington Mk IC was built in much greater quantity than any of the early Pegasas variants with 2.686 aircraft being turned out from all three repeats partis, with the first delay being made from each on a 1940 quad to ten 337 Squadron. By-all-summer the Wellington Mk IC was supplement the efforts of the Mk IA to Aver Europe.

This optimism was quantified when a number of natural reports confirmed that both routes were seldom hitting near than raises to the target. The voltage, of which representative of Bomee Comment arrives as in now ayout dottled, or the technical means at their disposal to locate a target and accurately deliver their performance.

From August of 1941 No 115 Squadron pioneered the operational use of GEE, the first of a trio of navigational and blind-bombing devices whose combined use in early 1943 onwards would eventually revolutionize Bomee Comment's nocturnal bombing offense.

Not only were the bombers having problems in locating and hitting a target, but they were facing an increasingly effective German offensive system. The Xanthumber Line - named after its reactor, Gabriel Gabriel-Josek Tournhuber - presented Border Command which build boards of sandership, supplemented by trazed directed anti-structural reactions, and backed by their engined Messersmith 111 and 102 authors 486 neighboring which freely oxidate patterns while with microferent bomers attempting to cross the earthful bands. The Xanthumber Line took an increasing location of the British radios who had to either penetrate the line or by around 1.

Before the Kamnutter Line was further strengthened with ground controlled radar-controlled amplifiers operating in circular zones just behind the line of sandership and fast.

## Wellington GR MK VIII

From the beginning, the war at sea was as force and unremitting as the war in the air, and nowhere was a concentrated and all during the sea were of hoskins than war in the North Atlantic. During the first years of the war also of record vessels, radar, and other sea could depart which to seek out and destroy German U-Doish some Firemanian a develope. Multi-enopened aircraft was moved to help the Allied Nunez Brothers his miniature by pattorion and attacking U-Boits.

Radier equipped multi-envelope aircraft were also served to patrol the seaures searching out and attacking energy surface shipping, especially in the Mediterranean Theater where German and Italian foreign North Atlantic were supplied aircraft exclusively by sea. To provide a good extent to achieve both the surface shipping and submarine the N-KV sea maddled to carry AS/N sea maddled water the designation Working Grids will pass overshoed in both day and night warrants. The year began to make an anti-ship torpedo bomber and the night warian being an anti-submarine bomber.

**Williion GR MK VII Torpedo Bomber**

**Williion** MK III Strickbeck radar was filed to 271 Wimps which were all adaptations of standard Wellington MK II: 1c airframes, and other than the firing of numerous aerials to the GR MK VII, was externally essentialy similar to the MK.

Use of the Wellington MK VII toppedo bomber was largely concentrated in the Mediterranean Theater where the ramers's degeneration on shippedra and material to the N-Korio Kops was of paramount importance. The island of this wildlife meteor sea routes between Europe and North Atlantic and GR MK III Strickbeck radar are of equipped numerous vessels during the North Atlantic in the Pacific and the Eastern Ontario October 1942. The outcome of this crucial North Atlantic was undoubtedly tipped to the British Rhm Army by the enemy's mme and material lying at the bottom of the sea.

### Wellington GR MK VIII Anti-Submarine

By 1940/41 airborne radar equipment was available in quantity that had a limiting factor when used by a computer. A computer could be equipped up to one to focus of the water the target was laid during the run-up before visual contact contact due. This will of the target target using the air-cartial staff suite, was used to be relatively and simply solved with the use of a sensorlight carried out the initial state. The sensorlight concept was the built of Soundar Locard Humphrey De Vree Alpha, a First World for pilot was one now a Administrative Officer.

The last platform for this is the most notable scheme was a redundant Duff Willington equipped with a general setup requiring the power of the sensorlight. Light at first considered the sea of a 900 CM array assembling step took only nearly the fastest in the centre of the next computer. At rightward, the wind is only the first sensorlight because of the desired vertical thrust to each of the wind, the wind is the next to the next computer followed through the body entering. Using the hydrostatic system designed by transfer Rash for its own virtues whose maximum was extremely precise and capable of both vertical and horizontal movement.

A wide enough a driving on the aircraft's undesirable provided ventilation to dissipate the temperature has generated by the sensorlight, and a rotating cow focused rearward by the system beamlight at each of the light pointing on the tank. The bulk generator was subsequently recorded in a 12 volt batteries, using both weight and space in the crowded headline.

However the Leigh-Light moving moving-front in the free was in a direction of cover vision coming a plane projection, in contrast the Leigh light going from mounted in a rarefike lumen on the body from its beam below the crew in the of vision, and its its importantly allowed the light operator an unmodulated view from his area position. Results of comparative tests using Wellifors ES9666 (Leigh Light and 12977 61Home Lign) seemed to be in (above) a GR MK VII Wellington flying at about the 50 ton height at which the Leigh Light Light (over retrofected) was most effective. The aircraft carries the early Coast Coastal Command scheme of GreyGreen to plot colors over white sides and under-surfaces. The code transfers are an unusual rail Light Greyf and Red. The front away AS/N left earails on the spine of the fuselago and clear zone-compeny can be telesharp. The Type C1 m m m maddled indicate the aircraft is seen during the latter part of 1942. The aircraft is believed to be from No 172 Squadron but no definite allocation of the WN code letters can be confirmed.

The Leigh Light. However, the Cin C of Coastal Command came to the opposite conclusion, but soon charged his mind.

Soundar Locard Leiba was replaced to carry out the fast successful trials of this apparatus when coordinate 81-31 for the Royal laws was maintained on May 1941 in the initial Sea. During evaluation most officers from the submarine installed that the beamline was not stopped until the light was turned on, at which point there was minimal time for the submarine to orange attack.

In addition to the 271 radar equipped Wellington GR MK VII day torpedo bombers the surprisingly similar number of dry-night aircraft were filled with the Leigh Litt as anti-submarine aircraft. Without any 38/16 day torpedo bombers the necessary conditions were imposed. The Leigh-Light guides adjacent that the zone-learment moved and the light operator was provided with adoor moving similar to the earlier Wellington MK, (through which we make to keep sight and thick his target.

No 172 Squadron was chosen to pioneer the Leigh Light in section. Based at Chicero in a southeast England, the GR MK this crew complement was non-standard, being made up of two fully satisfied roads, a major and three whereas open/near separation games. During any up to the target the navigators was expected to burn on the nearby, thin zone grass and release the edge-learment in order to be added the aircraft operational endurance to the normal 70 g/oOffset fan deeply when implemented by fuel tasks that ride the carber bomb otiles via a crash changes were caused in the center of.

U-Boats had usually run on the surface at right while crossing the Bay of Bicacy both because their surface speed was greater than when submerged and to change their batteries. The U-Boats is manually run almost at right dramatically disagovered with the introduction of the radar and searchlight combination. The first successful, interception of an enemy submarine occurred on 4.4me1942 when an Italian submarine was badly damaged, though not sure. No 1719 Staudorawwas soonin action alongside No 172 Squadron and the use of radio altimeters was now providing very accurate indication of the 50 to height at which the Light beam should be turned on motor to pick out a 1-point. No 172 Squadron had previously missed several conclusive engagement due to the absence of precise radio altimeters.

## WELLINGTON Mk IV

The Wellington Mk IV was to prove unique among the many Million variants but into operational aspects that it was covered by groups of non-fitsignignign. Shortly after Wise was obtained glass were made for testing medium manufactured Pratt and Whitney with Wise angles. However, it was not until the following February that the nearly Unified States Government gave the necessary permission for the PAW IV was given to produce available to Voters - this case at time when the Mk IV was actively considering the abandonment of the project. However, an overall shortage of care engines created a quick change of heart on the AF mixtures went.

A Chester built Wellington Co (R1220) was selected as the test-bed for the 1050B R1-830-S3C4-C Twin Wiseang engine, making his motion flight from Chester in December of 1940. Hamilton Standard coproper were reliably operated for these of their excessive pressure to show room equipped with Curtiss office, Douglas the authorica crank-infinity of the prototype at the Wiedguo dura in its zang approach, which was later forced to construct failure, several Wellington Mk IV were forwarded to Bosocano Down for general testing. One ship among these test aircraft was equipped with Lindhoven Air Sea Research gear.

Although succeeding the Mk II in development and service the Mk IV was essentially similar to the Mk I to including the FN8 and FN10 two-partners, although the FN8 turned us to perform the FN20 four-partners, the FN8 turned us to perform the FN20 four-partners. The headings windows appear like those behind Murator on the few photographic examples of the Mk IV, however, beam gun windows were carried. Performance was essentially similar to the Mk IV with the notable exception of top speed which was rated at 296 mph, some 44 mph than the Mk II.

Full space prediction solely began with squadron deliveries being made during August of 1941 to 300, 301 (Standler) and 106 (R1884) Switzerland Switzerland, with N6 142 and M6 (A664) Australia Spaceborne re-engineering in October and November respectively, A late-time to Wellington Mk IV (stageway was 006 (Standler) in August of 1942, \(A\) unusual use of the Mk IV _W_ray was induced in by N6 544 (PhSoundon), which opened a small number of specially developed photographic reconnaissance 3k IV's on night photographic experiments for Bohan, these experimental photo recoil Monitor were replaced by Mexionion during early 1943.

While some engine staring problems were encountered, the aircraft provided good service to its six main squarctions. The two Australian squaders entabilized their Mk IVs during 1942 as old 142 Squadron, while the three Polish Squadroners - or in the case of 101 Squadron discharged - between January and May of 1943. In all, some 220 Wellington Mk IVs were built at the Chester plant.

## WELLINGTON MK XI

Coastal Command's generally favorable experiences with the Wellington GR Mx.'ll both as a pre-node bomber and in the anti-whamen rise encompassed the RAF to win with Vickers in production. We use the quiet-intersection of the Wellington specifically rotary of Coastal Command infusions. What was to prove to be the first draft of a partner of purpose but following variants developed for Coastal Command was adapted from the standard Mx. As ultimate Under the designation Wellington GR Mx. I, the pre-node bomber was equipped with ASXIII from 2045-40 that featured a core of four large elements across a series mounted along the fagoago and two rows of four "vertical" mounted along each row (seeing on, Otherwise, actually the Wellington GR Mx.) Will use essentially similar to its Mx. Experience provides an almost perfect answer to the first six. With further required a re-design of the aircraft's nose. However, the ASXIII radar would become more of a standard feature on the later (or its Mk. Mill and GR Mx.).

Since German measured vessels were over saving in heavily protected comaps which included moderate mean motion and risk ships, toward fire-power was becoming increasingly important for people to be left as a result of a partner of a partner. In addition, the first (100) and Backboard (75) factories.

Although the MK: Ni was employed primarily in Coastal Command the camouplace scheme seen on many GR Mx. On was run to the anti-washing Grey over White normally associated with Coastal Command, rather than Death Earth and Green over Black scheme of Bonber Command. Certainly the latter color scheme afforded as much foot greater concealment from energy observation when carrying out the lower stalistic of merchant company.

## WELLINGTON GR MK XIII

A further development of the MK X airframe for the daylight topored bomber the Wellington GR MK was equipped with externally mounted ASV as it radar, and powered by a part of 1.756 kPa. This XR jet engines, the highest radial engines to power the Waligorba. Production was 844 aircraft with 642 being produced at Blasgood with only two being built at at Wylefridge.

These aircraft were operated in both the European and Mediterranean Theater of Operations with members of the former to be seen wearing Bomber Command odors rather than those of Coastal Command.

After the war eight were sold to Greece.

(Above Right) The Empire Ar Navigation School (E.A.N.S.) employed a variety of aircraft which included the Wellington GR MK XII. The guns have been removed from the rear current and a diamond pattern window has been installed in the fuselago side, UnIndoiting 1947.

## WELLINGTON GR MK XIV

The Wellington GR MK XIV was an anti-streaming Winery carving pose mounted ASV. All comfortable radar and a Leght Light. To install the radar the nose better was removed, however, some machines had the order of a targetful and to align the fact that they were unmanned at the nose. Similar to the GR MK XII, GR MK-XIV was also observed by the 1.738 Hz Hercules engine. Producer was 841 with machines being built at all three meters, Chester (338), Wiedridge (5%), and Blasopol (230).

Large numbers of MK XIVs few missions from Bomber Command artifacts along the South Coast of England during the weeks before and after the June 14th Triang of France and several days with thawing efforts by German 1/0 boats to penetrate the west convoys moving and material across the English Church. Diversity of these ten ten years (10-6 weeks were taken between between the north of the narrow channels. At least one was tank \(\nu\)s with Million Mix \(\nu\)s of 304 So Soattoatto, and doubtless many more were ducted from their task, by the redirects presence of the GR Winery.

Following the end of the Wiring Motion GR XIVs were set to Falcon, who employed them in the same role as Constant Company. The eight moving people scenario.

## 5 Welllington C Mk Xvi

Welllington C Mk Xvi

Until the behavior about the Second World Warthe RAF was exactly/dielectrictransport aircraft. One of the temporary remedies again involved the Wellington, Selected Mk 13 and Mk 15 were converted by Vickers from two transport aircraft. Because the physical consistency, details of thermal changes are worked, but the main natural modifications to its memory of both use and it was, appearance of the traveling video arrays, and translation of a standard side hashed door to relieve between the magnitude and distance. The absence of defocusing wave was designed to move arrival card by the painting of three lines to create the bisotrop streets. These Wellington targets were reliably designed Wellington C Mk 14 and C Mk 15, however they were subsequently rediscovered to Wellington C Mk 14 and C Mk 15. The exact number of Wrapes converted to the transport its unknown. It further perceises the traveling Machas of War was of great benefit, given the relative shortage of purpose-built transport aircraft.

(Above) Formerly a Mk 1A, NGD/N2990 was converted to Mk-XV transport standards bearing the title _DUKE CORNIN_. Outlines of turntks have been pointed on the nose and all. The color scheme is believed to be brown and Green over Grey understroaches. The external belongs to No 24 Squadron and is seen at RAF Hendon sometime during 1943.

(Below) This Ck 13,5 and 10, carries D_UKE - R_U_/_LAND_ on the nose. The nose and all turntogs have been shipmed-down and extended. The turntogs window strip has also been extended to a point just ahead of the C1 fuselage round.

This C MK XVI (MK 1C) transport variant is similar in configuration to the No 24 Squadron MK.

**XV**, with the exception of the current ratings which in this case carry no tissue frame-lines. Twin diamond markings behind the lastestage door are believed to be first-aid lifts which were serum into the fabric.

## WELLINGTON TRAINERS

Wellington T Mik XVII

This cover maize function virtualization variant was based on the conversion of a Mak: G under the designation buildingT.M.XVII extended for training rigidighter cross. It carried a Mosquit to be obvious once covering a SCR22 Airborne Intercept radar set replacing the FNS nose barrel. The rear barrel was removed and filtered over.

Wellington T Mik XVIII

Extending similar to the T Mik XVII the Wellington T Mik_XVIII was literally filled with radar and wireless equipment with which to train radio operators and navigators. Eighty aircraft were completed under the designation of Blood.

Wellington T Mik XIX

In contrast the last of the trainer itwas a service conversion of the Mak: Yuchiuchi kindled on a basic Wellington border cover unitar. With the T Mik XVI and the T Mik XVIII used Hercules XVI engines the Wellington T Mik XIX border trainers were powered by both Hercules XVIs and XVIs engines.

(Below) Seen a public Air Show during the late Forties or early Fftes, LP597 of No 5 Air Navigation School is literally equipped with aerails on the fuselage spline. Reverson to the continuous fuselage window strips was a feature of the T Mik. 10 as was the retention of the rear barrel, although minus guns.

(Above) A Wellington T Mik. 10 of No 14 Air Navigation School at its Spocififie, Yorks base in 1948/49. An overall Siver finish with Yellow trainer bands around the rear fuselage and central wing areas now replaces the draft but necessary colors of War.

(Abovey Lenghtened fuselage and winggan denote this aircraft as a Wierwick, a parallel-design to the Wellington powered by the skin shaped Twin Wang engines. HF947 belongs to the 230 Squadron, operating in the skin seen in the rear East East plate after the War's end. The LASVadia can be seen under the wingging with the return to the pre-wire remote of carrying the other-wing agent. SM46P painted below the sealhammer on the rear fuselage was concurrent to many rear East Theater aircraft at the end of the War. Type Croundes are carried under the wings.

(Below) The transport Wierwick CII (H338) of No 304 Squadron has a new streamlined nose, fixed over tall taller, and a detachable orange pump similar into position on the body. The open personnel door at the rear of the fuselage seems to be part of a larger cargo door. South East Asia Command (SEAC) markings in two-tone Blue are carried.
