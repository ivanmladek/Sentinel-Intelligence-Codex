When war broke out, the USAF had already started to dispose of F-51Ds in large numbers. Some went to the Air National Guard (there were 98 ANG Mustang squadrons by 1952), some were sold on the civilian market, air racing enthusiasis paying only $3500 for an unarmed but otherwise complete aircraft, while others went to many foreign air forces. _(Tom Strans)_.

## Introduction

Many veterans of the Korean War may sometimes wonder why so much sympathy and attention is lavished on those who lost in Vietnam, when so little is given to those who successfully preserved the integrity of South Korea, enhancing the reputation of the USA and its allies by winning a Western victory in the Cold War. The UN Forces lost 142,000 casualties in Korea, described by one prominent historian as the 'Century's nastiest little war'.

Perhaps it was the closeness of defeat, on more than one occasion, that led people to want to forget it. In the first stage of the war, the UN Forces were driven back into a tiny pocket around Pusan, from which evacuation seemed the only option. After the second stage, in which MacArthur landed at Inchon and pushed North almost to the Yalu river itself, the UN were pushed back hundreds of miles again, by a rag-bag army of Chinese guerrillas, operating virtually without air or artillery support. Later a succession of UN offensives pushed the front line back to the 38th Parallel, where the war stagnated into a frustrating and unsatisfying campaign of attrition in the bleak and rugged mountains.

Perhaps people would rather forget a war in which the Commander-in-Chief desperately wanted to use nuclear weapons, or one where the Western Democacies quite properly fought shoulder to shoulder with South Africa, although this created a debt which no liberal would want to acknowledge today.

Perhaps the war has been ignored by history because nothing seemed to have been achieved, at least in territorial terms, since the 1953 Amistice Line is virtually identical to the original 1945 Partition and pre-war border. Perhaps it was that Kim II Sung remained in power in the North while the West's equally undemocratic and distasteful puppet regime under President Syngham Rhee was not swept away either.

And yet it was a victory. The Communist North Korean invasion was repulsed, and in the air at least, the West won a decisive and undisputed victory.

This book is not intended to be a definitive history of the air war in Korea, nor is it a complete survey of the aircraft or units which participated. It is merely a photographic salute, dedicated, with respect, admiration and gratitude, to all of those who fought for the United Nations in Korea, but especially to the men of the air forces, whose contribution probably tipped the balance.

It was a difficult task selecting the photos which appear here. None are from official sources, and they represent only the tip of a huge iceberg of material.

We could have filled a book of this size with Sabres alone, and another with Mustangs, another with F-80s and yet another with F-84s. But we are not complaining. We are most grateful to all of those expliots and navigators, groundcrew and soldiers who have loaned us material, and if any reader has any pictures from the Korean War which might be useful for a follow-up to this book, or for the definitive history of the air war in Korea, perhaps they could get in touch with Mr Warren Thompson at 7201 Stamford Grove, Germantown, Tennessee, 38138, USA.

**Right** The Korean weather was harsh and unpleasant, and frequently made air operations difficult and hazardous, and sometimes impossible.

## The Mighty Mustang

How many Mustangs can you fit onto the deck of an aircraft carrier? This view of some of the 145 cocooned F-5IDs sent to Korea on board the USS _Bover_ in July 1950 gives a small idea of the scale of the US effort to reinforce Korea. These aircraft were withdrawn from ANG units and sent, with 70 pilots, to bolster the USAF in Korea, arriving in Tokyo on 23 July. Some were sent directly to Pohang to reinforce the units there, while others were used to equip the 67th Fighter Squadron of the 18th Fighter Bomber Group which had arrived from Clark AFB in the Philippines. _(Fogg)_BelowWhen the war broke out, there were some 30 Mustangs sitting forlorl only at Tachikawa, Japan, awaiting scrapping, which had been delayed because an officer there had had had a 'gut feeling' that to do so might not be prudent. These aircraft had been retired when the 35th Fisher Group had converted to the F-80, and were hurriterly pulled out of mothballs to re-equip the original owners, seen here, the 40th Fisher Squadron of the 35th Fisher Group, and the 51st Provisional Fisher Squadron (formed from a USAF unit responsible for training Korean pilots, and from pilots from the 12th FBS/18th FBG). _(Marvin Wallace)_

RightWhen the Korean War broke out, the Mustang had all but been retired from front-line service in the Far Eastern Air Force, but pilots were still not really proficient in their F-80Cs, which was proving short on endurance and which was incapable of using some of the forward airfields. Accordingly the Mustang was hurriterly pressed back into service. By the time the war had ended 194 had been lost, ten to enemy fighters, and all but twelve of the rest to ground fire. Mustangs accounted for 13 enemy aircraft. These naplam-laden Mustangs are from the 35th Fisher Squadron. _(Roy Bell)_

Mustangs from the 18th FBW during a fire-power demonstration at K-10. The nap Palm dropped by the lead aircraft has already started to go out in the first picture, while his wingman flies in, adding to the conflagration in the second picture. Napalm was a common and popular Mustang weapon, and was carried in special cylinders or in standard external fuel tanks. The 18th was the first unit to encounter the MiG-15, the first to fly from airstrips north of the 38th Parallel, and the last to discard the F-5. In its first two years it claimed 4780 enemy vehicles, more than 600 locomotives, and over 24,000 enemy troops, and eight of its pilots scored air-to-air victories in Korea

**Above** Red tail trim identifies this F-51D as an aircraft from the 67th Fighter Bomber Squadron at K-10 (Chinhae). HVARs were used in close support and ResCAP missions, often in conjunction with nap Palm and cannon. The first Commanding Officer of the 67th was one of only four winners of the Congressional Medal of Honor in Korea; Maj Louis J Sebille was hit in the engine and had a bomb hang up, but instead of limping home chose to make a further attack diving into an enemy vehicle after being fatally wounded. (Tom Shockley)

**Right** This nap Palm and rocket armed F-51D wears the markings of the 36th FBS, 8th Fighter Bomber Group. Two of the Group's units converted back to the F-51 from the F-80 in August 1950, moving from Itzauke to Tsuik before crossing over to Korean bases (Suwon and Kimpo) in October. The 8th pulled back to Japan for conversion to the F-80 in December 1950, after five months of war. During this period the Group lost more than 30 pilots, including all three of the original squadron commanders. Most of its Mustangs were passed on to the 18th. (El Mason)

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:16]

**Above** A line-up of Mustangs from the USAF's 18th FBG during June 1952. By this time, the 18th was the only Mustang-equipped non-ROK Fighter Bomber unit in Korea, and had absorbed one squadron from the 35th FIG, giving it four operational units. Morale remained high, and most aircraft carried nose art or names. One unusual member of the wing, who made at least 10 operational flights on the laps of the unit's pilots was a mongrel named 'Admiration Dawg'. _(Dislonghi)_

**Right** F-51D Mustangs returning home after a long mission over hostile territory. The F-51D was a useful fighter-bomber in Korea, although its liquid cooled Packard Merlin engine made it rather susceptible to damage from ground fire. These aircraft, though, belong to the 45th Tactical Reconnaissance Squadron, which was activated on 3 September 1950 at Itazuke in Japan before moving to Taegu (K-2). Initially, the unit had more 'plain' F-51s than RF-51s. It began to transition to RF-80s in the autumn of 1952, flying its last RF-51 mission in February 1953. _(Fortier)_.

## Shooting Stars

**Left** When the Korean war began, the Lockheed F-80 Shooting Star was the most important aircraft in the USAFs Far Eastern Air Force, with 360 aircraft equipping five Wings. F-80s operating from Japan were the first single-seat fighters in action in Korea and were initially the most important aircraft committed. Unfortunately, the aircraft was ill-suited to the Korean conditions, and two Wings quickly converted back to piston-engined Mustangs. Pilots loved the robust, reliable F-80 however, and Harvey Weaver even transferred from the 51st FIW to the 8th FIW to continue flying 'Stars when his old unit converted to the Sabre. _(Wawer)_

**Below** _The Bear City Special-Miss BB II and Evil Eye Flagle_ wear the sunburst fin marking of the 8th FIW in red, indicating their assignment to the 36th Fighter Bomber Wiring during late 1952. The guards sharkmouts were a short-lived decoration. The 8th FIW was the first F-80 unit in action, covering the initial evacuation of US civilians from Korea and mounting the first fighter bomber sweeps. The ability of the F-51D to operate from in-country airfields, together with its better payload/range, led to the re-equipment of the 8th FIW with Mustangs until December 1950. (Tom Queen)_

**Above**: When the 35th and 36th Fighter Bomber Squadrons transitioned back to the F-51D, the 80th remained an F-80 unit, providing F-80 continuation training for the pilots of the Wing and being attached to the 49th and 51st Wings before the 8th FBW finally converted back to the Shooting Star. Here a young pilot checks out the paperwork with his crewchief, while armourers wait to re-arm the airplane for another sortie. _(Don Broven)_

**Right**: On 28 June 1952 2nd Lt Warren Guibor flew this aircraft of the 80th FBS (Headunters') on the 50,000th combat sortie of the Korean war. He was one of 36 F-80 pilots who attacked enemy troop concentrations in the Wonsan area. On the same day, the USAF revealed some facts and figures about the 8th Fighter Bomber Wing's part of the war. Some 45 enemy aircraft had been destroyed by the unit, along with 256 tanks, 1916 artillery positions, 4026 vehicles, 48 locomotives, 6026 buildings and 14,684 enemy troops had been killed. _(Warren Guibor)_

We don't know why Charles Rowan was smoking a cigar in the cockpit of his 80th FBSF-80C. Maybe all that snow on the ground fooled him into thinking it might be Christmas at K-13. His lightning-flashed flying helmet is in the squadron colour, and bears the unit crest. _(Roxan)_Col Stanton T Smith, Commander of the 49th Figure B Above left: _The Magic Wan/Miss Ann_, pictured at Misawa in 1950, wears the blue nose and tip tank markings of the 7th FBS. The Sereaming Demons'. The aircraft also carries the original small capacity wingtip fuel tanks which so greatly limited the usefulness of the aircraft in the early days of the Korean war, before Lt Robert Eckman invented the 265 gallon Misawa tank, which conferred a radius of 350 miles. Before they moved to Korean bases, F-80 missions were dubbed the 'Bankers War' since their pilots went to war in the morning after a hearty breakfast, and were able to go home for dinner! _(Titchell)_

Below left: Lt Gerald Major stands proudly in front of his 8th fighter Bomber Squadron F-80C at Taegu. The aircraft in the background is a C-46 Command, already something of a rarity by 1951. The F-80 attrition rate had reached more than 18 aircraft per month by mid-1951, and one result of this was that the 49th FBW began conversion to the F-84 Thunderjet in June 1951, withdrawing to Japan to do so. While still an F-80 unit, in November 1950, the Wing had received a Distinguished Unit Citation for its pioneering work. _(Major)_

By November 1950, when it was

operating from Taegu, and when it

received a Distinguished Unit

Citation, the parent 49th FBW had

flown over 964 combat sorties,

destroying 27 enemy aircraft, 239

tanks, 105 vehicles, and 94

locomotives. _(Stearns)_

**Left**: Look closely! _IVe Two_ isn't a Shooting Star at all. Pictures of the Lockheed T-33 (the trainer derivative of the F-80) in Korea are very rare, so we make no excuse for including this study of a trainer/hack serving with the F-80 equipped 25th Fighter Intercept Squadron, 51st Fighter Wing at Naha, Okinawa. _(Hank Pfeiffer)_

**Above**: F-80 maintenance at Kimpo, home of the 51st Fighter Wing. Red trim was applied to aircraft from the 25th FIS, while the 16th FIS airplanes had dark blue trim. Kimpo had to be abandoned with little advance notice when the Chinese pushed south in the Christmas of 1950. Reconnaissance pilots reported Chinese soldiers going through the clothing and equipment left behind, so the 51st launched a mass namplm strike against its old 'tent city' home from its new base at Itazuke. _(H P Saubye)_

The 51st FIV was charged with gaining and maintaining air superiority over the Korean Peninsula during the summer of 1950, which was easy until November, when the vastly superior MiG-15 made its debut. Even so, four of the F-80s 41 air-to-air kills in Korea were MiG-15s. (_HP Saabye_)_Big Apple_ was the aircraft of Maj Charles A Appel, the CO of the 25th FIS. When not flown by him it was flown by other 25th FIS pilots, including Lt Shuman Black, seen here, who was killed in action during his 99th combat mission in Korea. _(John Dausen)_

**Above**: Lt Fredkin and his 15th Tactical Reconnaissance Squadron RF-80. The 15th Tac Recon Squadron (Motto: 'Every Man a Tiger') operated RF-80s as part of the 67th TRW, alongside the RF-5IDs of the 45th TRS, which eventually re-equipped with RF-80s. The initial Shooting Star recon version was the RF-80A, but this was soon replaced by RF-80Cs, the first of which were produced in the field by grafting an RF-80A nose onto a standard F-80C. This gave improved range and speed, but 'MiG Alley' remained out of bounds without Sabre top-cover. (_Jim Hanson_)

**Right**: The RF-80 marked a major improvement over the Mustang and was the fastest and most survivable reconnaissance aircraft in Korea. (_Gene Nenenam_)

## 11 Silver

Sabres

The 45th Fighter Interceptor Wing, based at New Castle County Airport, Delaware, was the USAF's most experienced jet fighter unit, and the obvious choice when it wanted to send an F-86 Wing to Korea. After trading some of its older aircraft with other F-86A units, the Wing was ready to go. The aircraft of 334th and 335th Fighter Interceptor Squadrons were sent to Korea on board the USS _Cape Expearance_, while the 336th FIS aircraft went by tanker. The 336th flew their first sweep on 17th December 1950, in aircraft marked with prominent black and white stripes on the fuselage and wings.

**Left** A North American F-86A Sabre of the 4th Fighter Interceptor Wing. The Sabre was the only UN fighter capable of meeting the MiG-15 on even terms, although in some respects its performance and armament were inferior. When using tactics which took advantage of the MiG's superior rate of climb, it was a difficult target, but time and again the USAF pilot's superior training and tactics gave them the edge. By the time it was all over, 792 MiGs had fallen to the F-86, for only 58 losses in air combat. _(Harrington)_

**Right** Capt Manuel 'Pete' Fernandez, a pilot with the 334th FIS, was one of the leading aces of the Korean war, with 14 MiG-15 victories scored between October 1952 and May 1953. The 334th was a nest of aces, since Fernandez' squadron mates included Jabara with 15 kills, Davis with 14, and with 10, Frederick 'Boots' Blesse, author of 'No Guts, No Glory' (for many years the USAF's main treatise on tactics). _(Bruno Giordano)_

**Above**: James Jabara was the first jet ace in Korea, and went on to become the second highest scoring ace of the war with 15 kills, all of them MIG-15s. Here he is seen being interviewed after his fifth and sixth victories, scored on 20 May 1951. A Captain during his first tour, during which he scored six kills, he returned to Korea and the 334th FIS as a Major to down a further nine enemy aircraft. _(El Fletcher)_

**Right**: The 4th FIV's black and white bands were replaced by black-edged yellow recognition bands in late 1951, when F-86Es replaced the A-model Sabres, and when the 51st FIV also re-equipped with F-86E Sabre from the F-80 Shooting Star. An extra black-edged yellow band across the fin served as a wing marking, while the individual squadrons applied their badges to the forward fuselage. _(Ernie Atkinson)_

**Left**: The Indian's head insignia identifies this F1IV F86E as belonging to the 335th FIS. The 335th was the top-scoring unit of the war, with no less than fourteen of the USAF's 39 Sabre Aces, four with ten kills each. The Squadron's pilots claimed a total of 218\(\frac{1}{2}\) air-to-air kills. _(Harry Jones)_

**Above**: Richard Keener, an F-86 pilot with the 335th, poses in front of the sign in front of the 4th FIG's Operations area. The monthly total of MiGs destroyed had not been put up, but would have been impressive. During the war the Group destroyed 4772 air combat victories, and destroyed four further enemy aircraft on the ground

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:43]

**Left** F-86Es of the 335th ready to go, sitting on the alert pad at Kimpo (K-14). Most MiG kills were achieved during routine escort missions, or on patrols over the Yalu. When MiGs were encountered, their appearance often differed greatly. Some were camouflaged, some were silver, and some carried huge areas of colour (often red). The quality of the enemy pilots varied as much as the colour schemes worn by their aircraft. Some used their aircraft to devastating effect, employing hit and run surprise attacks which the Sabres could not counter, while others seemed unable even to take simple evasive action without colliding or spinning out of control. Some enemy pilots simply ejected when threatened!

**Above right** Jeff Dibrell, a pilot with the 336th FIS, flew this F-86E, _Peg 'O' My Heart' Tiger Shack_, which was relatively unusual in carrying a gaudy looking sharkmouth. Personal markings on the 4th's Sabres became progressively larger and more gaudy as the war progressed. _(Dibrell)_

**Below right** Sabre scoreboard! Captain Chuck Owens of the 336th FIS had an impressive tally of kills, including trucks and tanks, on his aircraft, _El Diablo_. Some of the nine air-to-air kills were not scored by Owens who did not gain the coveted five-kill 'Ace' status. _(Hintermier)_

**Above**: Pictured in a revetment at K-14 is _Honest John/Stud_, mount of the 4th FIG's CO, Col Walker Mahurin: This aircraft later carried five and half kill markings, and the silhouette of a railway locomotive.

**Right**: Twenty-five F-86Es are visible in this view of a portion of the flight deck of the USS _Cape Espareance_, Delivery of these aircraft in July 1951 allowed the re-equipment of the F-80C-equipped 51st FIV, giving the USAF two F-86 Wings (with about 130 aircraft) in Korea to meet the estimated total of 445 Red Chinese MiG-15s. By July 1951 the 4th FIW had also re-equipped with the F-86E, whose hydraulic controls and all flying tail gave much improved handling, especially at high speed. _(Harry Dawson)_

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:46]

Perhaps the most aptly named Sabre of the war was this F-86E, flown by Capt Corbell of the 39th FIS, 51st FIW. The activation of a second Sabre Wing initially caused some problems. The maintenance and supply organization had been finding it hard supporting one Wing, and when the second formed, the situation quickly reached crisis point, with shortages of spares and even fuel tanks. In February 1952, for example, 45 per cent of the Sabres were grounded. _(Shutt)__My Best Best_ was the personal aircraft of 2nd Lt Bernard Vise, a pilot of the 16th FIS. The black chequers on the tail were the Wing marking of the 51st FIW, while the squadrons added a narrow coloured band above the chequers: blue for the 16th FIS, red for the 25th, and yellow for the 39th. Japanese-made fuel tanks had very different separation characteristics when jettisoned, and were painted olive drab so that pilots would know immediately which type they were carrying. (_Vise_)

**Above**: Third Sabre Wing to form was the 18th FBW, a long-time Mustang operator, which converted from its ageing prop-driven fighters to F-86Fs in January 1953, after moving from K-46 (Hoengsong) to K-55 (Osan), a brand new airfield. Originally the aircraft carried a dark blue fin band with white stars superimposed. The 12th FBS trimmed this with yellow, while the 67th used red. _(F G Smart)_

**Right**: When the 18th FBW's last unit, the South African Air Force No 2 Eqn re-equipped with Sabres, their orange, white and blue colours were adopted as the Wing marking. Each squadron used a unit badge on the forward fuselage, and the 67th painted the noses of its Sabres with a red and yellow band, while the 12th chose a black-edged yellow band. _Sandra_ of the 12th FBS was flown by Capt John Jamieson. _(Ken Smith)_

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:50]

Above leftThis aircraft, named _Hard's Hornet_ was flown by Lt Robert Hard of the 67th FBS from Osan and carried nose at and its name on the port side. The squadron's Fighting Cock' badge, complete with boxing gloves, was carried on both sides under the cockpit. The F-86F was an excellent fighter bomber, since although it carried a smaller load than the F-84, over a shorter distance, it could deal with the MiG-15 without needing an escort. The only major problem was that it was a poor vehicle for the delivery of napalm, since its attack speed was rather high. _(Carroll Blum)_

RightThe last USAF unit in Korea to receive the Sabre was the 8th Fighter Bomber Wing, which traded in its F-80Cs to receive brand new F-86Fs. Col W B Wilmet, the Wing CO, flew this aircraft. _Miss Teen_, whose fin sunburst bore the colours of the three assigned squadators: blue for the 35th, red for the 36th and yellow for the 80th Fighter Bomber Squadrons. These up-engined Sabres were actually capable of climbing as high as the MiG-15, and nearly as quickly, but their primary role was close air support. _(James Carter)_

## The Sound

of Thunder

The shuffling of F-84s between units, which frequently changed

designation, resulted in a confusing

plethora of unit markings. These two

aircraft, taking off from Itazuke with

the aid of RATOG, belonged to the

524th Fisher Escort Squadron, 27th

Fighter Escort Wing. This SAC

sector Wing. led by Lt Col Don

Blakeslee, was the first F-84 unit in

Korea, and performed remarkably,

despite having had no close support

training. Its aircraft arrived in Japan

on 30 November 1950 on board the

USS _Batan,_ but were damaged by

salt spray and were not ready for

operations, initially from Taegu, until

7 December 1950. _(Dick Hellwege)_A Republic F-84E Thunderjet of the 522nd FES takes off, laden with 500 lb bombs. The F-84 Thunderjet was some 40 mph faster than the F-80, and packed a much heavier punch. On a typical long range sortie, the F-84 could carry eight rockets and 1300 rounds of ammunition for its 0.5 inch machine guns, or 1800 rounds with no rockets. Moreover, especially at low altitude, the Thunderjet was much less of a'sitting duck' for enemy MiGs. (_Dick Helluseg_)In May 1951 the 27th FEW went home, leaving their aircraft behind to equip the 136th Fighter Bomber Group, a newly activated Air National Guard unit comprised of two squadrons from Texas (the 11th and 182nd Fighter Bomber Squadrons) and one (the 154th FBS) from Arkansas. Blue trim identifies these F-84Es as belonging to the 111th. (_Cale Herry_)

**Left** The 49th FBW was the second Thunderiet Wing in Korea, re-equipping from the F-80C. Most of the pilots already had at least 50 combat missions, so conversion was swift. The Wing re-commenced operations in mid-August 1951.

**Right** The Thunderiet could take it! Battle damage to the intake of an 8th FBS F-84G. The ability to withstand battle damage, combined with great agility and acceleration at low altitude made the F-84 a difficult target to knock down when it was on the deck, in its element. _(Charles Scofield)_

**Right**: The third Thunderjet Wing in Korea was the 116th FBW, an ANG unit consisting of the 158th FBS from Georgia, the 159th from Florida, and the 196th from California. The primary role of the new Wing was the air defence of Japan, although it undertook brief deployments to Korean bases for operational fighter bomber missions, known as 'Skat' sorties. Here three F-84s from the 159th FBS are seen on a 'Skat' mission from K-2. _(Martin Bambrick)_

In July 1952 the 116th at Kunsan had been relieved by the 474th Figure-Bomber Wing, at the same time as the 58th relieved the 136th at Taegu. To confuse matters, in April the 49th and 474th changed names, personnel and equipment, with the latter unit then becoming the 58th FBW (reinforced). These changes were purely cosmetic, but meant that the chevrons traditionally associated with the 49th were worn by a unit successively known as the 474th and then as the 58th FBW (Reinforced). _(Bob Lines)_Cel Joe Davis straps in in the cockpit of his aircraft, _Four Queens_ at Taegu.

_Siamese Lady_ and _Dovdle Bug_ were two F-82G Twin Mustangs of the 68th F(AWS)S, based at Itzauke, Japan, during 1950. After flying daylight missions covering the evacuation of civilians from Korea, the 68th's Twin Mustangs were used briefly as fighter-borners, but a detachment was left behind for night fighter duties when the unit returned to Japan in the summer of 1951. (_Hubbard_)A scantily-clad reclining lady decorates this freshly-painted F-82G. The glossy black paint was intended to hinder enemy searchlights but very soon became worn, stained and semi-matt. Interestingly, this aircraft was used for a series of well-known, obviously-posed publicity photographs, with a 'wife' and young children waving goodbye as the aircraft taxied out. _(Mel Carlson)_

**Above**: VMF(N)513's Corsairs adopted the flat black paint scheme, with code letters and serials in red, to cut down reflections when working in conjunction with flare-dropping aircraft. Ground fire during such missions was very heavy, and the new scheme made a worthwhile difference. _(Ray Stewart)_
**Right**: When VMF(N)513 was fully up to strength with 24 aircraft, it would send four F3D Skynights out with each package of 18 bombers. Bomber losses fell dramatically, and when the MiGs dared to show up, they were flamed! The Skynight was operational in Korea four years after the first flight of the prototype. _(Wall Repetski)_

**Above** Routine maintenance on the radar of a VMF(N)513 Skynight. Though primitive by later standards, in 1952 the Douglas F3D Skynight was a state-of-the-art machine, and its radar equipment was more effective than that carried by the Air Force F-94s. In fact the Skynight carried three radar sets, an AN/APG-20 that locked on the 20 mmannon and which was effective out to 4000 yards; the AN/APS-21 search radar which scanned the forward quadrant out to 90 degrees on each side of the nose, and to 60 degrees above and 30 degrees below, with a range of 15 miles; and the AN/APS-28 tail warning radar, which scanned a 144-degree cone from 150 yards out to about four miles.

During its service with the F-51D the squadron lost 74 out of the 95 Mustangs it received, and 12 pilots killed, with 30 more missing. _(Charles Trunho)_No 77 Sap, RAAF, entered the fray equipped with Mustangs, converting to the Meteor F Mk & B in 1951 after flying 3800 sorties and losing 18 aircraft and ten pilots. The Meteor was the most modern fighter available to the Australians, who wanted the much-delayed Hawker Hunter, and it was cheap! Initially the Australians had an unhappy time with the Meteor, using tactics which were too defensive and failing to make use of its excellent manoeuvrability at low altitude. After a number of dogfights in which the Meteor came off second best against MiG-15s, the unit was withdrawn from the air-to-air role. _(Charles Pavey)_

The Fireflies were augmented by unreliable Supermarine Sefire FR MK 47s, although all future RN carriers in Korea had Sea Furies. Radar-equipped Fireflies were among the aircraft types used to try to stop the 'Bedcheck Charlie' Polikarpovs, unfortunately without success. _(Fletcher Macadeus)_

It was one of the ex-_Glory_ aircraft taken over by No 802 Sqn when _Ocean_ relieved _Glory_ on station in Korea. The Sea Furies performed island defence, CAP, anti-submarine patrol, and interdiction duties, flying up to 70 sorties per day. Rockets and 500 lb bombs were the favourite weapons. _(Vashburn)_

**Above**: A Sea Fury of No 802 Sqn was used by Lt Peter Carmichael to down a MiG-15 (the first to fall to a piston-engined fighter) on 3 April 1952. The Sea Fury's powerful Bristol Centaurus engine and excellent lines combined to make it one of the fastest piston-engined fighters ever built, with a top speed of some 460 mph in level flight, at operational weights. _(Billy AHo)_

**Abstract**

The British Royal Air Force played a largely unsung role in Korea, but did send a number of aircraft. This Auster AOP aircraft was one of them. (The Army Air Corps did not come into existence until 1957.) The RAF also sent Sunderland flying boats for long range anti-shipping patrols and for search and rescue, while the Spiffire Mk 24s of No 80 Sqn, and the FR Mk 18s of No 28 Sqn, both normally based at Hong Kong, also played their part. Perhaps most importantly, RAF pilots served as exchange officers with frontline USAF units

**Right**: Most Royal Navy and RAF aircraft in Korea carried black and white identification stripes, to prevent them being confused with enemy Lavochkins or Yaks. These didn't always work, and more than one Sea Fury pilot was shot up by US fighters. Fortunately, none was injured. _(Callahan)_

## 10 Theory Also Served

**Right**: MASH revisited as medics unload a casualty from a VMO-6 helicopter! VMO-6 fulfilled a wide range of tasks, from rescue and medevac to artillery spotting, resupply and troop transport. The squadron pioneered the use of helicopters at night with a variety of aircraft types, including the Bell 47 (known as the HTL-4 to the Marines) and, seen here, the rather less familiar Sikorsky HO5S-I. Marine pilots were less than impressed by the 'Tinker Toy' undercarriage of the latter type. _(Lymn Mikkiff)_

**Below**: Combat Cargo Command played a major role in Korea, initially with the C-54s of the 374th Troop Carrier Wing and the C-47s of the 21st Troop Carrier Squadron (the 'Kyushu Cypysies'). These were soon joined by the C-119s of the 314th Troop Carrier Group, and these aircraft played a major part in supporting the landings at Inchon, the paratroop drop at Sunchon and the retreat from Chosin. This 314th TCG aircraft was assigned to the 'Green Homets' of the 61st TCS. _(Dale Backman)_

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:122]

The C-47 was not used for transport missions. The Kyushu Gypsies included a Special Air Missions unit which dropped propaganda leaflets and made loudspeaker broadcasts urging enemy troops to'surrender or die', and telling them 'life or death, it's your choice', often after heavy artillery barages. On one occasion 1800 troops surrendered from an enemy unit only 200 strong, while the rest field! This aircraft however, was used for flare-dropping in support of B-26 night intruder missions under the code-name 'Firefly', _(Nordlund)_The T-6 family saw extensive service in Korea. Some were used for spraying mosquitos, while others, like this AT-6G Texan of the 6147th Tactical Control Group, were actually known as Mosquitos themselves, operating in the vital FAC (Forward Air Control) role. _(Herb Pederson)_

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:125]

**Left** Combat Cargo received a huge boost in September 1951, when a Douglas C-124 Globemaster visited the Far East for the first time. Capable of off-loading five times more cargo than any other aircraft in the theatre, the CV-124 quickly proved itself capable of operating from even the most primitive strips. This anonymous looking 'Globie' was pictured at Seoul.in 1953. _(Kener)_

The Enemy

**Left** The Ilyushin II-10 _Stromovik_ was an excellent ground attack aircraft.

Rugged, tough, and reliable, it was however, a sitting duck for UN fighters, and large numbers were downed. This one was captured intact at Kimpo. _(Ray Stewart)_

**Below** This Yak, rock-marked by bullets, was abandoned at Kimpo after it was shot up by F-51Ds. Yak 3s and Yak 7s together with ageing P-39s, P-63s and II-10s formed the backbone of Communist air power before November 1950.

The Yak 7 would probably have been a match for the F-51D in the hands of a skilled pilot, but the North Koreans lacked experience and training. _(Ernest Fahlberg)_Lts Beebe, Auten, and Cheatum examine a North Korean T-34 tank, which shows little signs of damage despite having been knocked out by UN aircraft a few miles short of Taegu (K-2). _(Allen Nelson)_
