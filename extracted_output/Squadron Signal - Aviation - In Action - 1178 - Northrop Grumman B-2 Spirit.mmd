reduces the range at which ground-based and air-based radars can detect the aircraft. The RAM absorbs most of the radar's signal, and the aircraft's wing-shaped and rounded design redirects much of the remaining power away from the radar source. Special low-noise General Electric F118 turbine engines are buried deep inside the B-2-3's fading, prohibiting any direct view of the engine faces from the tablets. The inlet air intakes and exhaust ejectors are placed on the top of the aircraft, hiding the jet engine's compressor blades from radar detection. Additionally, hot gases are mostly with cool air before leaving the exhaust thereby reducing the B-2's Infrared (IR) signature and keeping heat-seagling missies or detection systems from locking onto the aircraft. ECM is a last-resort attempt to confuse the radar operator through jamming and ghost imaging.

The most impressive characteristic of stealth is, of course, its low observability on radar. Stealth works by incorporating some other regular secular technologies that reduce or eliminate itral radar return signals. Stealth aircraft such as the B-2, the Lockheed **F117 Nighthaw**, the Lockheed **Mir** **F3-50 Joint Streicher (F3SF)**, and the soon-to-be-operated Lockheed **Mir** (Pointing-2.2.2 Radar) are covered with layer of RAM. It reduces to a minimum any signal that might be inadvertently reflected back to its source. The paint and composite structures making up the airframe above or absorb similar energy.

The B-2's shape is vastly different from that of any other aircraft in today's military. Some common next features that were found to be incompatible with stealth are engines in external pads, vertical sublaimbers, tail assemblies, and external stores. The successful stealth design had to meet a number of potentially conflicting requirements. The aerodynamic and structural challenges of the long-range, large-payload bombardment had to be overcome, while at the same time maximizing the low-observable characteristics of the aircraft.

The stealth bomb here has a bit-surge shape designed to reduce its radar cross-section, as well as visual recognition - especially on the horizon. The smooth blending of the main fuseghe into the wing area produces a ring wing shape when viewed from above or below. The straight shape presented by the aircraft from these perspectives is offset by the wing class plus radar-dose opposing reflections, along in the cancellation of any reflected radar energy. The B-2 engine imclits, when viewed from above, have a dramatic 'W-shaped design that looks rather lie jagged teeth.

The aircraft's shape consists of all curves, yet they are not consistent identical curves; the curves continually change in radius. There is no abrupt distinction between body and wing. The dorsal lamp rises smoothly from the top surface, but the undershoe swells gradually from the outermost trailing edge to the centerline. It looks something like an ovoid from the rear or front, with minimal overall cross section. Lockheed's earlier F-117 utilizes a faceted surface design (each panel is always at an odd angle to the next one), while the Northrope-designed 2-dashes to a smooth-bending concept.

Ease of maintenance and deployability over also important considerations. Additionally, the aircraft had to be able to communicate, detect targets, navigate and perform other functions - all without revealing its location.

The B-2, as built is naturally unstable due to the fact that most of its mass is at of the center of this mass the Digital Flight Control System (DPCS) the most critical subsystem to the aircraft. In a straightforwardly-by-wire or possibly a fly-by-tip system, the DPCS controls the tight layer flags that comprise most of the B-2's leading edge. These flags can be used to increase or decrease left on take-off of landing. The DPCS also controls two smaller flags located directly behind the over-wing exhausts. These can turn the emissions directly upward or downward via the Conda effect, in which airheres to the aircraft's surface even while causing away from the engines' axis. The B-2 is the first aircraft to use thrust vectoring for flight control.

The stealth technology benefits are obvious, especially knowing that 70 percent of all Soviet air defense systems we make detection and tracking. The primary threat to aircraft is radar, and what makes stealth possible in the achievement of a major reduction in the inacircrafts.

Recons: Fermar at Force Chief of Staff Larry Welch was quoted as saying. _"The B-2's RCS is in the laser category."_

In addition to the above, however, the other elements of air defense detection and tracking (IR, Electron-Optical [EO], and visual contrivals) must also be circumvented if an aircraft is to be considered truly'stealth'.

The Northrope TACT RULE stealth reconnaissance testbed was declassified in 1998. The sole example built was retired to the US Air Force Museum at Wright- Patterson AFB in Dayton, Ohio. Information gained from the TACT RULE was used to refine the use of Radar Absorbent Materials (RAMS) for the B-2 Spirit. (Northrope Grumman)

The first B-2A (B-1066) is parked in front of its hangar at Air Force Plant 42 in Palmidale, California after the Spirtik rollot on 22 November 1988. Quests attending the rollout were kept 200 feet (81 ft) from the aircraft to prevent close inspection of the B-2's secret details. (USAF via G. Phillips)The B-2 Combined Test Force at Edwards was responsible for flight testing Engineering, Manufacturing and Development (EMD) aircraft. The B-2 was initially assigned to the 6520th Test Squadron/6510th Test Wing. Aerodynamic performance and airworthness formed Block of the test program, which was completed in 13 flights totaling 67 hours (up to 30 June 1990). Block also included the first airborne ring on November 8, 1989, and the first flight with an all-USAT over on 3 May 1990.

The second prototype, "A-V2 (8-1067), drew from Palmale to Edwards in 19 October 1990, and "A-V3 (8-1068) did likewise in 8 June 1991. AV-2 took over flight envelope expansion tests on AV-V3 and also carried out flutter, load, landing gear and weapons by door tests. A-V3 was the first aircraft method with the Hughes ANNALQ-181 radar and it performed much of the activities testing.

Block of the critical LO testing, began on 23 October 1990. During the 11th test flight (on 26 July 1991), AV-I3 had a larger reference than had been expected from one particular aspect on one radar frequency. It was later determined this bad been caused by incorrectly applied RAM on the wings' leading blades. It was clear from the tests, the B-2 was even stealth-ier than the F-117, and by the then the latter had been proven in convoluted for large injuries that brand generated the air defenses around Baghd without detection.

By the time the first aircraft was delivered to the USAR on 17 December 1993, the B-2 had achieved several important milestones. It completed fatigue to 20,000 hours; understall an all supervision and taxipatoli trials; passed static load tests; and completed flutter clearance. It was performed a simulated 9,2-hour homing mission, cleared the flight-refine envelope with both RC-10 and AC-155 meters, and free at 80% of the maximum the cost-off weight.

## Production

The prime contractor (responsible for overall system design and integration) is Nortrop Gamma's 8-2 Division. Boeing Military Aircraft Company, Vought Aircraft Company, Hughes Radar Systems Group, and General Electric Aircraft Engine Group are also key members of the aircraft contractor's team. Another major contractor is Hughes Training Inc. (HTU) - Link Division (formerly known as CAE) - Link Flight Simulation Corporation. This organization is responsible for interviewating devices such as the weapon systems trainer and the mission trainer. Nortrop Gamma and is major subcontractment, HTI (excluding Link Division), responsible for developing and integrating all aircraft and maintenance programs.

Total B-2 production ended at 21 aircraft in 1997. All six development aircraft were updated to block-30 production standards and delivered to the US Air Force's 509th Bonn Wing (BW) at Whiteming AFB, Missouri. The Air Force accepted delivery of production B-2s in three configuration blocks designated as Block 10, Block 20, and Block 30. Delivery was completed of six test aircraft, ten Block 10, three Block 20, and two Block 30 aircraft.

Block 10-com/offered aircraft provided limited combat capability with no capability to launch guided weapons ("sumt bonus"). The Block 10 model was able to carry 2000 pound (007.2 to 30) MR 45 commercial bonus or gravity nuclear weapons.

Block 20-com/offered aircraft had an interim capability to launch nuclear and conventional munitions, including the Ground Positioning System (GPS)-Albed Minitions (GAMs). The Block 20 model has been tested with the CBU-87/B Combined Effects Monitor (CEM) test bench.

Block 30-com/offered aircraft are fully capable and meet the essential employment equipment.

tiles defined by the Air Force. The first fully coupled Block 30 aircraft (503-1087, the SPIR-ITO PFNSNYLVANIA) was delivered to the Air Force on 7 August 1997. Compared to the Block 20x, the Block 30x have approximately twice as many radar modes together with enhanced ram-following capability and the ability to deliver additional weapons; including the Joint Direct Attack Monitor (DQAM) and the Joint Joint-Output VSOAP (NOSW), Other features include incorporation of configuration changes needed to have 28-2s in the condition of approved radar signature; replacement of the alt codes; installation of remaining defensive avicories functions; and installation of a nominal management system. All B-2s are up to the Block 30 configuration standard. This process began in July of 1995 and was completed in early 2000.

Air Vehicle Seven (AV-7) to AV-16 were built to Block 10 standards (B-2A-10-NO). This limited the B-2 to carrying 16 B35 free-fall nuclear weapons or 16 2000 pound MR 84 "iron" bombs and restricted is employment to missions of two over the aircraft from Robinson Whiteming, but with the option of recovering to a friendly house. AV-12 through AV-16 were upgraded to Block 20 standard in 1996over.

AV-17 AO-17 AO-19 were built to Block 20 standards. This type the aircraft the ability to carry up to 35C Member Bonb Units (CBUs) or 16 2000 pound JDAM inertial-guided bombs. A GPS-Aided Targeting System (GATS) was installed in conjunction with JDAM. Block 20 allowed partial low-level terrain following and a deployable mission-planning system to permit multi-airairair deployments to forward bases.

AV-20 and AV-21 were built to the definitive Block 30 standards. This allowed the aircraft to carry 80 500 pound (226.8 x0) MR 82 bombs, 80 580 pound (263.1 x0) MR 62 mines, or 36 750 pound (340.2 x0) MR 117 fireboms. A Miltar satellite communication system was added and the mission planning system became fully functional. Primary maintenance responsibilities for the B-2 are divided between three facilities throughout the United States. The Oklahoma City Air Logistics Center (ALC) at Tinker AFB, Oklahoma is contacted to perform various software maintenance. The Opden ALC at Hill AFB, Utah maintains landing gear and trainers under Air Force contract. Periodic depot maintenance is performed at the Northrop Gamma facility at Air Force Plant 42 in Palmdale, California.

In May of 1996, the Air Force decided to upgrade AV-1 (82-1066) to operational Block 30 status. This B-2A - named the SPIRIT OF AMERICA - brought the operational fleet up to 21 aircraft.

The basis for the useful life of the B-2 includes data from initial Development Test and Evaluation analysis. Data indicates that the aircraft should be structurally sound to approximately 40,000 flight hours using current mission profiles. Analysis further suggests that the order attachment points are the first structural failure item. The B-2 has not implemented an Aircraft Structural Improvement Program (ASP) similar to the other design, and this makes it difficult to predict the economic service life and attrition rate. A national projection based on the B-25 predicts that one aircraft will be lost every years. This attrition rate, plus attrition due to service life, will reduce the B-2 force below its requirement of 19 aircraft by the year 2007.

**Block 30 B-2As, including the SPHT OF WASHERTON (8-0322), are fitted with one piece wing leading edges. These eliminated the need for multi-piece leading edges, connected with hairpins. The leading edges are in the same Gunning Gray (F830801) final as the rest of the airframe, upgraded Spirits (including earlier Block 20 aircraft) also have sets of four static ports in front of the windshield. These ports measure airspeed, angle of attack, sideslip, and pitch and yaw for the flight instruments. (Jim Goodall)**

The B-2's laminated acrylic windshield is approximately three to four inches (7.6 to 10.2) thick. A fine gold-colored wire mesh is placed between the inner and outer clear panels. This mesh keeps hostile radar waves out of the cockpit and retains cooler reflections inside the aircraft. Light gray dashes mark the emergency egress panel immediately above the ejection seats. (Jim Goodall)The B-2-r's engine inlet drops down from the aircraft upper surface to the engines buried inside. A special boundary layer inlet just below each intake smooths airflow to the main conduit. This air is then divided to the exhaust system for cooling, thus reducing the B-2s further stagnate. Specific images of the Spirit's engine inlets were off-limits to the general public until mid-2001. (Jim Goodall)

(Lim Goodall)The Spirit's wing leading edge varies in camber (curvature) and design from the nose to the wingtip. This results in an apparent droop on the nose leading edge, which becomes rounded along the remaining leading edge. This B-2A is the SPHPT OF Pennsylvania/NANAIA (93-107K), the first two 300 Spirit.

The upgrade also included improved avionics and the ability to carry an precision weapons. (Lim Goods)

## Air Refueling

Interview with Major Scott Vander Hamm, B-2 Pilot, 509th Bomb Wing (BW), March of 1998

(Vander Hamm flask; author idented).

In the B-2 an easy aircraft to refuel in flight?

It is very easy, and this is not to sham some of the gaps who don't refuel, but it's very easy for the BUFF [Big UJF] Far Fellowship years. The BUFF (that's the B-2) is a very difficult plane to refuel and so when they come in here, it's a similar picture. All they have to get used to is the thothetic response and how it causes a slight pitch and down. One type yet used to that, they are very solid, and by near the gaps why can come from single-search aircraft that line up the center, it takes them away a couple series to get comfortable. The only thing about the B-2 - you cannot get comparable with refreshing. You're in such close proximity. The refueling is made by the closure and we need to say to close an to greater than a for second. That Technical Order has just been changed to say, Close as slow a rare as possible. We interact with the K-C-135. If we come in too quickly, we will push their autocified and cause them to get into a PIO [Pio-Induced Oscillation, a pitch movement; this is also called "porposing"]. And we've actually kicked off their autopilot before. So we have a bow wave similar to that of the C-S.

Is far refueling with the K-C-10 easier?

Very much. His envelope is larger. As you come up there, you don't push him around rearly as much because he's so much bigger, and once you get into position (because his envelope is low) you cannot get out...

He soft of sucks you in from the...

He doesn't really say you in home...

He doesn't really say you in, but if you try to to right or left, his engines (those two engines) are creating reshoked to the center. I guess you could have a limited choscuter with him. I never have - not an inadvertent disconnect - so yes, the KC-10 is much easier to refuel against.

When you're air refreshing, as you bring on fuel, does your angle of attack change dramatically or does your CG [Center of Gravity] change?

Not dramatically. On one of the missions that I did to Hawaii, we took on quite a big on-load - approximately 1000,000 pounds (45,360 x) of gas - and what you do notice is that your throttes... in light weight, live if kind of back, and so you retain the throttes are up a little higher. But the OdA (Angle of attack), it changes by degree but nothing noticeable, so what happens when taken it is heavyweight is that it gets a little more sluggish. You put a throttle response in and it takes a little while for it to move, so you have to be very patient when you're heavyweight.

What is the maximum gross weight of the B-2?

We can take-off at 311,500 pounds (1412964 x60) and during in-flight refueling go up to 336,500 pounds (1526364 x60). With the B-52, you could refuel that aircraft up to..., 525,000 pounds (238,140 x60), but the max[imm] on the ground was 488,000 pounds (2213568 x60) for take-off.

The trailing edge control surfaces are dropped while the B-2A SPRIT OF WASHINGTON (B-0323) is in its hangar. This is due to the lack of hydraulic power to these surfaces when the engines are shut off. The lower half of the split rudder is dropped, while the upper half rests parallel to the wing upper surface. (Jim Goodall)

The B-2A SPRIT OF MISSOUR (AV-4, 88-0329) is parked in its servicing hangar at WTHENTA PHR, Missouri. A series of round metal circles on the hangar floor are part of the fire suppression system. If the various sensors in the hangar detect fire or flash, the entire hangar will fill up with the suppression foam in a matter of seconds. This applies to camera flashes as well as actual fires; this system was turned off prior to the author taking flash photographs for this book. (Jim Goodall)

A B-2 is prepared for pre-flight inspection inside its dedicated servicing hangar at WTHENTA PHR. The hangar is open at both the front and rear, with the rear opening allowing jet exhausts to be vented outdoors. The US Air Force restricts any viewing of the B-2 from the rear at air shows, due to the classified nature of the low-observable engine exhaust system. (Jim Goodall)

## Weapons

The B-2 has two weapons hys located in the lower centerbody. Each bay contains a set of bomb rates or a Boeing Advanced Applications Rotry Launcher (AARL). A launcher can accommodate only one type of weapon at a time, so each bay may contain only one weapon type; however, the two boys may hold different types of weapons.

In the nuclear role, the B-2 can city up to 16 of the following weapons:

### ARAI-129 Advanced Cruise Missile (ACAI)

The Rayton (formerly Gerard Dynamics) ACM was built as a stealthy replacement for the Boeing AGM-86, but production was curtailed at the end of the Cold War in 1991 and only 241 AGM-1298 were built. The MCM carries a 808-1 nuclear warnball with a yield ranging from five Kilos (Kli) to 200 K. The ACM-1298 is 22.5 for (8.3) long within a 10.75% foot (3.3) to wingen, weighs 3700 pounds (1678.8 xci), and has a range of 4800 nmc (7724.6 xci). It has a number of design features that reduce radar cross-section including a minimal number of multiplier edges, low-power sensors, forward-swept wings, freugsel RAM, a flash inlet, and shielded exhaust.

### B61

The B-2 carries the Mod 11 version of the B61 free-fall nuclear weapon. This has a variable yield of between ten and 340 Kli. The weapon's casing is specially strengthened, making it suitable for employment against hard-buried targets.

### B63

The B83 is the USA's second-most powerful nuclear weapon, with a variable yield of up to 1.2 Megators (MF). (The nine M83 bomb carried by B-52s is the most powerful US nuclear warnlo). It is optimized for accurate, low-level supersonic delivery against hard targets, but can also be used as an arbitrat weapon (with or without parachute retardation).

The B-2 is more likely to be employed to drop conventional weapons. Although it only has two weapons hys, it can carry approximately the same amount as the B-1B (which has three weapons hys) or the "Big-Bell" modified B-2Ds used during the air campaign over Vietnam.

### Mk 82 (60)

The 500 bound (226.8 xci) Mk 82 is a gravity bomb and was the first weapon cleared for use by the B-2. In 2003, the B-2 will have a DAM version of this weapon called the GBU-30.

### GPS-Aided Muntions (GAMs) (16)

The USA/ Northrop Gummus developed the Global Positioning System (GPS)-Aided Muntion (GAM) system as an interim precision monitor for the B-2. GAM is a tail kit that fits into the 200 bound (907.2 xci) Mk 82 general-purpose bomb (GRU-36/B) or the 4700 bound (231.93 to B-11/2) generator (GRU-37/B). GAMs use GPS guidance to more accoun- and 1.2 dex into open the explosive fence of 1000 ms (907.2 xci) of min/subsoftware (TNT)
traley guide weapons to target locations. The GRU-37 was added to the B-2 arsenal in late 1997. All of the approximately 100 GAMs built were delivered to the 500h BW. It may be assumed that most, if not all, were expended during Operation ALLIED FORCE against Yagoolxia in 1999.

### Joint Direct Attack Muntions (JDAMs) (16)

The B-2s primary conventional weapon is the precision-guided 2000 ground GRU-32 joint Direct-attack Muntion (DAM). The Boeing ADAM is basically a tail kit that runs 2000 ground MR 84 general-purpose bomb (or a BLU-109 generator bomb) into a GPS-aided inertial Navigation System (MSS)-guided precision weapon. It is estimated that 700 GRU-32s were dropped by B-2s during Operation ALLIED FORCE in 1999, with an estimated 87 percent target destruction rate.

### Cbi-87 (36)

The Cbi-87 Combined-Effects Muntions (CEM) contain 202 BLU-978 combined-effects bombs, which then released have a footprint of approximately 600 feet (182.9 30) wide by 1000 feet (304.8 30) long. The bomblets are effective against light armor, personnel and muerieri. Each Bomblet is approximately 7.8 inches (19.8 50) long and 24.4 inches (6.1 50) in diameter. The Cbi-87 is 7.5 feet (23.3 30) long and 13.3 feet (0.4 0) in diameter and weighs 948 pounds (430. 60).

### Cbi-89 (36)

The Cbi-89 (36) guard is an area-detail cluster weapon containing 72 BLU-91/B anti-ank and 22 BLU-92/B anti-envolumes. In this configuration it weighs just under 1000 pounds (453.6 30). It is 7.5 feet (2.3 30) long and 15 inches (38.1 40) in diameter. The size of the mini-field depends on the height from which the weapon is released, but it is typically 500 feet (152.4 30) wide by 1300 feet (396.2 30) long.
CBU-97 (36)

The CBU-97 Sensor-Fixed Weapon contains ten BLU-108/B subnominations, each containing four armor-penetrating projectiles with sensors to detect infrared targets. At a pre-set altitude, the rocket motor fires to spin the subnominations and initiate an ascent. Each subnomination then releases its four projectiles at the redloff over the target area. The projectile's sensor detects a vehicles' infrared signature and its explosively-formed penetrative fires at the heat source. The CBU-97 is 7.5 feet (23 s) long and 15 inches (38.1 cm) in diameter and weighs 925 pounds (419.6 s). It can cover an area of approximately 500 feet by 1300 feet.

### AGM-54 Joint Stanford Weapon (3500) (16)

The Rayborne Isow is a low-cost wide polygon with a standoff capability from 20 miles (2.2 kcu to 50 miles (80.5 kv), depending on the launch altitude. It is a launch-and-leave weapon that employs a tightly coupled GPSINS navigation system for midcourse navigation, and imaging infrared and radial systems for terminal homing.

The ISOW is just for 12.8 feet (3.9 m) long and weighs between 1000 and 1300 pounds (453.6 s to 600 kv). Extra flexibility has been built into the missile by its modular design that allows several different subnominations, unitary warheads, or non-lethal payloads to be carried.

ISOW: A (AGM-154A) disperses (148.107 g) embedded-testophiles which are used to attack out targets as Surface-Ad-Air missile (SAM) sites or airfields. The ISOW-B (AGM-154B) disperses six BLU-108 anti-armobinations. The B-2 became operational with ISOW in mid-2000.

### AGM-158 Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile (JASSM) (16)

The Lockheed Martin LASSM is a precision cruise missile designed for launch from outside area defines in order to hit a variety of fixed and relevable targets. After launch, it will be able to fly autonomously over a low-level, indirect route to the target area where an independent terminal guidance system will guide the missile in for a target hit.

LASSM's microwave guidance is provided by a GPS-aided Inertial Navigation System (INS) protected by a new anti-jam GPS null-setting antenna system. An Imaging Infrared (IR) socket and a target reception system guide the missile in the terminal phase. These provide an-joint detection, tracking and strike capabilities. The AGM-158 is 14 feet (4.3 s) long, weighs 2250 pounds (1020.6 kv), and has a range exceeding 200 nautical miles (230.3 statute miles/370.6 sx).

JASSM is scheduled to be available to the B-2 semetine in 2002/2003.

A Joint Direct Attack Multition (JQAM) configured 2000 ground BU-100 bomb is placed on a taller near a B-2. A GPS receiver in the tail until precisely guides the weapon. Stracse fitted to the controlled side the JQAM in accurately flying to its target. The Split can carry 16 2000 ground JMAA - eight per weapons bay (in (Goodest)

The most powerful JQAM weapon available to B-2 crews is the 4700 bound (2131.8 x)

603-03-07 (formerly QAM-13) array-based "Runf Burst". When dropped from an anti-tab to 45.000 best (13.7%) with the weapon can penetrate those to four layers of 12 foot (3.7 u)-bits reinforced concrete. A sensor in the tail assembly detects how many floors the "Runf Burst" has penetrated. The Mission Commander can select the required detontion level. (aim Goodall)

Fifty thousand feet [15,230 st] is what we have in our Tech(inal) Order [TO] and that's real-by the limit that I can tell you out of our earliest's capability. Anytime you go above 50,000 feet (you can look in any undestified AI Force regulation). you need a full pressure suit. We do not try with those. The TO limit that is undesatisfied - that we share even when we go on air shows - is 50,000 feet. You talked about the wing loading - that's an interesting thing. It has the lowest wing load of any aircraft and what that means...if you are in turbulence, it'll be very bumpy down-saturs and so it's very important to have been in the air recently. Then you're not as asserpicable to stuff like being isolated around so much. I've had it so bump that as I went to touch the MDP [Multiple Display Unit], I couldn't even touch the buttons. We have four of them in front of each pilot. I had to reach my hand up there, stabilize my hand, and then crawl my fingers over to the button I wanted to push.

Now, unlike the B-1 that has the cranads that will smooth out the aircraft, is there...?

That's called SMCS - the Structural Mode Control System - and basically it was designed to increase airfire life by using some of that loading off. It doesn't know it out. What smokes it out is when the wings come back. The wing loading (like B-1 and I-11)? very high, so we could fly and even in what would be severe turbulence to another aircraft, it would be light turbulence to a B-1. The SMCS (small carouts mounted on the B-1's nose - c1,) move at 200 per second and they've constantly adjusting. They give a better bonding platform and they also increase the structural life of the aircraft.

The strongest computing power available to the F-17's designers was the equivalent of a simple four-bit bolus processor. The B-2's options look advantage of the massive computing power available from super-fast mainframe computers. The earlier Nightghaw uses a faceted surface design, while the Spirit employs smooth blending of the airframe surface. (US Air Force) There's a device called the Gust Load Alteration System and that's what looks like the water trail. It moves to take away some of that rolling impact and increase the structural life of the aircraft. It's just another good design and it's there to help the ride for the pilots, the bombing platform, and the same reasons they have the SMCS on the B-1.

The heavier tail is what damages some of the loads on the airframe in a high-turbulence, low-altitude environment.

### Interview with Brigadier General Tom Goslin, 509th Bomb Wing Commander, March of 1998

Note: Following this interview, Brigadier General Gostin was promoted to Major General. As of this writing, he is assigned to the Pentagon.

(Gostin fluid; author indented.)

When did you become involved in the B-2 program?

Originally I was briefed in late 1981, again before I moved up to the black roll office (before it was brought into existence - the XO-SP [Vice Commander Support Squadron office]). I was a number action officer and XO-XFS [Vice Commander Preliminary Mission Planning] (or the Air Force plans for bodies and IEMs) and I was briefed into the B-2 program and the (XAI-2-H) Advanced Chinese Missile) ACM program late in 1981. Then my involvement there is carried over and I was selected to be the first bomber way in the XO-SP office when

**Brigadier General Tom Goslin, Commander of the 509th Bomb Wing, stands in front of a B-2A while speaking to the air show crowd gathered at IREL AFB, Nevada. This was during the US Air Force's 50th Anniversary celebration in April of 1997. Goslin was later promoted to Major General, (Jim Goodall)**it was created about six months later.

From the initial conception of the B-2 in drawings to what we have today (the Block 30), did the design change dramatically?1 know some of the mission profiles changed, but...

It changed a little bit but I wouldn't say dramatically. The plan for the aircraft looked a little bit different, but you would have recognized it instantaneously as the B-2 that we have today.

When did you become involved in the 500th?

I became involved in the 500th when General Joe Ralston (who in 1995 was the commander of Air Conult Command) fortunately selected me to become the Wing Commander and that was the first time that started to have any direct involvement in the 500th. Now he also had hired me as his ADD (Assistant Director of Operation) 4 Air Conult Command in the summer of '95. So obviously I worked with the 500th like I started with all the wing of Air Conult Command in taking care of different running and operationalises. When I found out that I was going to become the Wing Commander - that would have been in late '95.' is also came out on the Brighter General's list and that year the list was released just before Christmas, so I knew from five.

The B-2 is a very complicated system. All stealth systems are very complicated in that most

**The B-2-A SPINT OF PRESNIVANIA (93-1087) task to the end of a runway at Whiteman AFB. This number the auxiliary tables doors and split flags are open and the boxer limit is lowered. Despite the open and open sources, the B-2 has a low radar Cross-Section (RGS). Gen Larry Welch - Air Force Chief of Staff when the Spirit first new in 1989 - said: "The B-2-RGS is in the Insect category."(lim Goodall)**

of it is in the design, not necessarily in the coatings. The coatings are important, but most of it is in the design of the airframe. The coatings are the final products that really hone the overall L0 Low Observable1 signature. The B-2 has many more coatings that are used on at different material used on it than other health aircraft. It was a very high-technology thing, very complicated thing, and until we started to use the aircraft in a lot of different types of environments and operationally, that was when we first really started to understand the coatings and really started to press the coatings. At that time...the Block I showed a tendency for some of the strips of tup one the edges to start to come up in the rain.

What is involved from the 500th to deploy a number of B-2s to foreign soil?

The B-2 is such a special aircraft, a costly aircraft, that there are precautions from a security standpoint. When you deploy overages, you do a lot of planning prior to that to ensure that you're going to a safe location. This is in order to prevent most of the actual protest.

Are there contingencies in place...what if you had a B-2 where you had a mid-air collision with another aircraft - where you had to land it immediately, didn't lose the aircraft, and there was no loss of life but it's not necessarily in a secured location?

Again, there are plans that are put into place every time we move any type of military aircraft an approach in the world so that if something occurs that is not in the primary plan - a driver for whatever reason - we have got plans to take care of that. The B-2 is no different. Some parts of the B-2 need to be protected from a technological standpoint, so that just means that we have a little more security than we normally would at other places.

Is it comparable with the F-117/A or the B-18?

Yes. When I was in the F-117/A program, we had pictures of ourselves sitting in the cockpit with our names on our jets, but this was all up to protect - they were kept in a vault. We were talking about maintenance... this aircraft has much later technology than the B-1 and it was built to be very maintaining, or much easier to maintain. For instance, with the exception of working on certain areas underneath the aircraft to guard the leading edges of the surfaces, all the stuff underneath the engines, busy, activities busy and stuff like that) was all built to be accessible while you're standing on the ground. Big improvements. So in the traditional sense (engings, hydralies, electronics, air, that type of things, the aircraft is very reliable aircraft.) You're familiar with how we do phase in aircraft. Right now we have the longest time between phases of any cowatch aircraft in Air Conult Command. We are at 600 hours. That's longer than anybody else - fibers, bombers, whatever. The reason it's like that is because in terms of his basic flying abilities and its basic fighting abilities, the aircraft is a very, very good aircraft. We are more intensive in terms of the covering because unlike all the other jets except the F-117/s, our covering is a part of the reason that the jet works - versus an aluminum aircraft, which has either a nice covering or a camouflage covering.

What is the life expectancy of the B-2?I don't know. Right now we make statements like it'll be here through 2030. The folds that work it - from the NCOs to the senior NCOs that have worked on a number of different aircraft, both bombers and figisters - they say this aircraft is probably the most solid-built aircraft they've were worked on. In terms of its structure, this aircraft has much more in common with a fighter than it does with a bomber. It is a very strong, very rigid aircraft, It has a powerful airframe. Since it's mainly non-metal, we do conversion control on the aircraft but the corrosion is not nearly the problem on composite aircraft as it is so aluminum aircraft.

Compared with the F-117, without giving the specifics, is the B-2 scheduler, the same...?

It's comparable. Both aircraft are the most survivable aircraft the United States has. Obviously, IGDMs [Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles] are probably the most survivable right now, but both aircraft have comparable survivability. Both aircraft are designed essentially to do the same thing, i.e., go into the most heavily defended areas and deliver precious weapons. Both aircraft can accomplish that. Where we offer most obviously is that the B-2 can do its mission from the heartland of America and come back to the heartland of America. That's our huge advantage nowadays, I'll go down? It was to deploy those sands of tens of equipment forward and hundreds of people forward, number one. You don't have to have a place to get them. Burnnet two:

That many money people are not always ready. Any number there: it is strictly a national thing. Whatever the national community antibary, but in the United States. We are using an carry it out from right here in the United States. We are using the only aircraft in the US inventory and probably the only system in the US inventory that offers precision conventional attack through any type of weather, which is a big [plus]. Another thing is that like all bombers, we carry as many. We realize about human in terms of precision weapons with a single aircraft, putting only too people at risk. I can't get into it, but I can tell you from a weaponing standpoint about the B-2's ability to independently target 16 weapons on a single site of need, or cross many sites - up to 16 sites. That's a huge advantage over the delivery systems we have right now.

I think what's important for your readers to know is that as American taxpy, they made a huge investment in this aircraft and a huge investment in this system. This system is considerably right now. This system can do its mission in a conventional or in a nuclear way, and we are asked to do that. We have commitments throughout the spectrum of conflict that we can meet. We are able to meet our commitments while continuing to grow and train additional costs we are with we will have all full force force and a full maintenance and support force in place when we get all of our aircraft on board. I think that is really important to the American pole.

## Operation ALLIED FORCE

On 24 March 1999, following the initial cruise missile strikes, the B-2 became the first manned aircraft to engage in hostillities during Operation ALLIED FORCE, but they accounted for 11 percent. Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) air campaign against Yugoslavia. The operation was in reply to the Serbst "ball conflict with ethnic Albmanians in the Setb province of Kosow. Two Spirts attacked targets in Serbia, with each aircraft dropping 16.2000 found (907.2 so) GBU-23 DAMS at the 16-hour flight from Whieman AFB, Missouri.

In its first of combat, the B-2 beamber defeated not only the Serbian air defense system, but also the nagyers who for years had insisted it would not work as advertised or would never be finished in a real start where.

The B-2s of the 500th Bomb Wing at Whiteman AFB flee less than one percent of the total sorting hours by NATO aircraft in Operation ALLIED FORCE, but they accounted for 11 percent of the bomb had stopped in that conflict.

Plying 30-hour-long, nonstop missions from Whiteman to Yugoslavia and back, USAF B-2s attacked heavily defended targets in all weather conditions. All returned without a scratch. The aircraft next aircraft maintained a high readiness rate, given the small number of aircraft available.

B-2s participated in 34 of the B-3 total rise Chicago ders in the conflict. Only one mission was combined because of mechanical problems and that B-2s was fiscal ready to go in less than 30 minutes.

The B-2s of ALLIED FORCE put 90 percent of their bomb s well within the prescribed 30 feet (90.1 day range turner, Most of the B-2's bombus hit the bull's-eye, and the rest fell only) a short distance boost. Spirts dropped over 500 MB/s (Plants) (2000 month bombs) and four 4700 equal (2313.90) GBU-1708 banker buster weapons during the conflict.

The B-2s operated exclusively at night, sometimes in a two-ship mission but usually as a lone Split. While they did not fly in-min's orbit the NATO users as part of a strike package, the B-2s is taxted to carefully signed timing for their arrival and in order to meet area.

 Spirts sometimes served as the opening round of a multi-pendorpassit.

For example, B-2s were sometimes used to precisely carier intersections of unways and taxiways on airfields. Thus based in on those airfields and prevented from escaping, the Serb aircraft were later destroyed by one-instability B-2s of 8-B bombus that dropped large numbers of unguided 'tourb. In one instance, a single B-2 destroyed two airfields on the same mission. The operation demonstrated that the B-2 can be folded in (a seamless fashion) with other assets in-theuter.

The B-2s took advantage of 'jammers' (Electronic Countermeasures aircraft) that were operating in the area. This tactic was driven more by a desire to provide extra protection for the events by a critical operational need.

During a post-ALLLIED FORCE interview, then Bragidier General LEROBrange (500th Bomb Wing (Chemmark) said that he frequently receives obvious about whether such airfields need electron circumstances support. _The answer is no._," he asserted. It was _"before-edial and sought to have EA-6s **Profiles** and other names in the area, but we operated in an autonomous fashion. As the Operation ALLIED FORCE campaign won on, mission parameters become increasingly confident about sending B-2s against targets without any EW Electronic Warf award._

\({}^{\dagger}\)_Key Data Order, a private scheduling at all strikes of tighter, attack, banke, tugler, electronics warf, and search and rescue aircraft for a given mission._

_"Operation ALLIED FORCE proved that the B-2 is a really asset that could easily become the first weapon called on a crisis. In a future conflict, it is possible that the United States might have to prepare for battle in a foreign area without the benefit of forward-based forces. This situation could result from a number of factors such as strategic surprise, space constraints, and political constraints (to name that a few). In such a situation, the United States would still have a powerful millone aircraft had to abort its mission for an in-flight mechanical problem. Once that aircraft, landed, a repair was made and it was ready to go again in just 15 minutes. Two other missions were canceled after take-off because NATO partners withdrew permission to attack the intended targets.

During ALLID FORCE, the 500th W.W. had nine operational B2 bombers on the ramp at W. Whistemann. The USAF assigned eight B-2s to combat missions; six were available at any given time. The bombers not in action were used to continue training of new B-2 pilots, conduct aircraft tests, or carry out mandatory inspection.

On Day One of the operation, the 500th carried out the perflight inspection and final mission planning for the B-2 going into action. These tasks were conducted by other team member on behalf of the pilots who were in crew rest and to be disturbed until just before the flight. When it was time to go, the assigned crew goes to their aircraft, taxel, and took off.

Even if they were headed for targets in entirely different parts of Yugoslavia, the B-2s taking off the same night usually few together from Whistemann across the Atlantic, their path being to provide mutual support on the long runs-Atlantic trip. They related twice on route - once over the Atlantic and again just before entering Yugoslavia.

During the flight, crew members received their thresholds, studied imagery of the target, got weather updates, and monitored the health of the aircraft, endeavoring to make sure everything was perfect on the first runs. They kept in shifts.

These 'power naps' were actually factored into the mission planning. A crewmember took his since on a beach long purchased at the local WaI-Mart store. This particular kounge model just happened to fit perfectly in the space behind the aircraft Commander's station.

Other techniques for fresching up included wet-toweling, changing clothes, and eating warm meals.

Upon entering the war zone, crewmembers went through a ritual of getting ready for combat by putting to 'long-bins' (thermal underwater), winter-weight flight jackets, survival tests, and and other gear not necessary during other portions of the mission. The final element in preparation was the powering of up of the weapons and ensuring that the computer was commissioned correctly with the bombs.

On approach to the designated target area, the B-2 generated a synthetic aperture radar picture almost photographie in detail and quality. This was then checked against intelligence photosors and the target was identified. Next, the GPS coordinates were verified via the B-2's unique GPS-Aided Targeting System (GATS) equipment that permitted the B-2's Mission Commander to choose aim-points on the target - even if clouds, darkness or weather observed it.

The coordinates were then updated, if necessary, and for into the IQAM weapon via an ice-driven umbilical cord. At the appropriate moment (once for each bomb), the bomb was doors would open, a JAM would drop clear of the aircraft, and the weapon would then steer itself to the target.

Each B-2 could (and in some cases did) attack 16 different target locations per mission. Pilots reported that apparently they were never detected. One said that moments after touching down at Whistemann, be was intrigued to see a best leader on television, standing in a carter, combining about NATO's use of cruise missiles. _"h wasn's a cruise missile,"_ the pilot said, _"In was at 'I'm shadow they knew have were there."_.

_"The JDMAs proved unattendingly reliable and accurate,"_ remarked one lead pilot. Barnidge said that the reliability of the IQAM was well above 95 percent, adding that, _"There were no snipid transitions dropped by the B-2."_Interview with Major Tony Monetti and Major Harry Foster, 4 August 2000

Note: Major Monetti and Major Foster each flew two B-2A combat missions during Operation ALLID FORCE.

(Monetti standard type flash: Foster italics type flash: author standard type isolated.)

Did both of you gentleness fly during ALLID FORCE?

_Yes. I'd 'Might Two'_ [25 March 1999] _and Tours. I don't know when...._

I don't remember what night I flew either, but I did fly.

When things were starting to heat up in the Balkans, did you think they were going to use the B-2?

_Prior to that we were in for two years here. We had been on everyone's drawing board to use. There was a coarse of spots who were always in what we call constant spin-up, working up chimneysglass... they were brought in and told. This is a year eyes only-type operation. That had gone on for approximately two years here, so when this began - don't want to say we live any of these flagistically - we were turning cluting what driving would become of this. The negotiations were ongoing in France, we were watching the news, and Congress seemed not really interested in our getting involved in this. So we were first brought together and told that we have being considered in a plan - "To say say or going to be the first eight years" - we all said, days, here we go again. As it grew closer, about two weeks from the constant year, the following were then diffuses we met things where he updating and getting more serious. When we actually got to a point where we had never been before and when we got the new turning (a piece of paper on the base), then we were all pretty sure that hay, this might happen._

That's when it started getting exciting?

_That's right. From the beginning we were thinking that maybe this was just a two-day type of sulfur and so it was kept to a very small group of people initially. Then as we got very short, we realized that this might in fact be an anti couping, and to what get off another level of spin and get overlook the base scale about it._

_We got everyone in the B-2 program cosmic experience and that run a massive brute from the leadership here. They recognized that they had hired a code of very experienced fighter and bomber plates. Instead of trying to finish his to a few people or a few IPs_ [Instover Plots], they spread the wealth amongst everybody - and I think that's going to pay the B-2 dividends in the long run._

From 24 hours before the mission, what was your schedule like? Or 48 hours, what ever the proper...?

_I was pure or "Night One"_ [24 March 1999]. _That night we had two prime aircraft and two spare aircraft. Forty-eight hours out, we came in, sat around the table, and sort of walked through the mission with the OG_ [Operational Group] _and the Wing Commander. We were trying to walk through what could go wrong and if it did go wrong, what were we going to do. We walked through those contingencies and were briefed for the mission and that we went home. Because of the length of the B-2 missions that we fly, we fly heavily on the mission-planning cell to the mission plan. When you walk in a creenumber, essentially you are honted to package and you so execute. In We did have the "Night One" targets well at advance, so 48 hours out we were looking at those. And the new went home. At about the 36-hour point before take-off we stayed in crew. We can mount the four hours before take-off and essentially hard fortid and stored into the aircraft. We had pretty much dame all we could add. It was time to go and the mission and that she start by add._

What thought was unique was how here an Whitemson, we train the way we fight and fight the way we train - so this was not something completely foreign to us. We'd come in and get as idea of where we might be going, what the threat picture looked like, then we'd go home. Some of us had from combined mission prior where you reporporly somewhere, you go into this little room by yourself and then you go launch. Well, in this case, you go home. And that was unique about it. You went home and you had dame. And my kids started picking up that something was different because I always war that this might help. The My son and ia ia that something was up. I told that, even Well, if I'll see you in a couple days.

Then you don't come in and you do go down down. You don't say that you don't get spin-up on where you're going, what the threat picture looked like, you'd launch, and then you'd come back after strike. So you would have been put for, I don't know, two days, flying 30 hours, and then you'd come home. And you don't want your BAB [Bonn Damber Assessment on CNN [Cable News Network]]. It was a completely unique situation. "Surreal" is the term that was used in the post will still look twice.

**The SPORT OF MISSOURI (AV-8, 88-0329) runs its engines while waiting on the ramp between hangs at Whitemson AFB. The B-2A awarded the go-ahead to begin its 30-hour mission to attack key yugoslav targets in support of Operation ALLID FORCE in March of 1999. This was the NATO air campaign against Yugoslavia, whose Sers were fighting ethnic Abhangs in Kosovo. (Northrop Grumman)**_The CNN effort is something to comment about. We watched this thing sign up and we were very concerned here about [being] _vspect and providing operational cover for what we were doing at the base. We went to get lengths to do at all 1 will tell you that right before I can in to be sure that right, one of my neighbors should not visit codes at the door and said good luck. What has chance or what? But it had been reported on CNN and it was widely suspect the B-2 would be hard. The American people are 't know and it opened nor eyes to how difficult it is to cover something like this, what with CNN and everything being life._

What was your feeling when you rolled out of the hangar and started your take-off?

_First of all. There is to tell you the feeling on 'Night One' - the feeling as a space on 'Night One' - was that I was fired up and ready to go. I just knew I was going to go but the aircraft book worked. We saw incredible maintenance reliability during the war. I was just phenomenon. There was a big feature after Night One's, being and part of getting so._

_Night Two.'ve went home to create rest and through this whole thing again - go right to sleep, come back in, and then get for the next night's social. So pulling out there or Night One's was different, feeling because they you were playing that our aircraft wouldn's breath. Again, our maintenance reliability throughout the war was phenomened. It was nearly 100 percent in terms of reliability and pulling out of the hangar. To get your question, it was just great feeling. You wanted there. You turned out there. The Creus Childs had done their job, everything was coming together, you'd take-off and it was great. Right after we get airborne there was a lot of life-down... okay, a lot of attention. I don't figens before you and you get very intense for about to be in._

_A shift is one operation which I've took an action._

_A shift supervisor and bomb loading team go over their checklist prior to loading JDAMs into the B-2A SPHTHT for misssessment (AV-B-1071). Each B-2 stationed at Withernan AP, Missouri is assigned to own individual hangar, where all maintenance, searching, and weapons loading takes place. (Northrop Grumm)_

_a two or three-hour sortic. Well, this was a 30-hour sortic so now you had to calm yourself down and think okay, it's still 15 hours to the target. As soon as we got airborne, I went back and went to sleep or about how how large we hit the first star. We were sleeping on the floor in the early sortic. Later somebody had the idea to go but Not-Mart and how I have chairs, but we were sleeping on an air anterers on the floor, which I didn't mind. That was the thing that I learned from was difficult about a long-duration flight. you're going to combat that it's to lose you away and you can't't yourself enough on it's the moment. So that was different from when _A_-11. If you face an eight-boxer in DESST Oxford [1991 Pegian Staff War]. He was a visiting of the horn and airborne for what we started to do. For so, we've had you can't get too high because this is a manathon, not a priori._

_I can honestly say that I felt completely comfortable in the B-2. For one thing, I knew the people that we breath this operation. You could forget the Northrop Company and all the little malnatteratters that are out there but this plane together and look at to ride off the next life piece._

_bose the animal piece that we are talking once the maninenet stuff, at the far title confines and the medics. I mean, it's all this whole team effort. And then us, of course - trained in and then there were were, about to go to 4. There is one other aircraft in the world of I have to be in when I was going to combat - one that gives us this method more to get there, the payload (sixteen 2000 bound [907.2 2 00] seri-precision weapons), the sheath to penetrate the enemy at defines - you can tell it? You combine all these strengths together, and you get yourself on check of a fighting machine. And then there were, employing this weapons system for the first time - not a training mission but a combat mission - and I felt completely comfortable. I mean, all of us did. There's no other weapons system \(\Gamma\)d want to be in._

_Generally we were dropping eight a pass. And what went through my mind was 1 guess the only 5'power. I've felt we were 'double-checking switches. Oday, we've done everything we can, It was really... 1'd have to say it was 4' heaving a transition. It really was more like fringe versus. I requested to see triple I ami-Atiti-Atitiver called _we (here, a lot of things that I had seen going 50UTHEW WATCH)_

_I remember that things of what combat would be like, from my experiences in Baghol. I went to Baghol a couple times and remember step right \(\Lambda\) and the missile knolues and hearing the radio chance. There were we, over this country._

_We had just two external-favor._

_We had just two external-favor._

_I think we have to get more than one another, but they still sent two B-2s and there were. You didn't heard anybody on the radio. They so that it was a thing. There was bad weather beneath but we were just lifting and we released our weapons and came home. And we hit every target. It was a completely unique situation that we were in - and the weapons system works._

_Part of it was just listening. They were jamming the guard radio or it was interference or something - Id'on's. We were listening to some bad Italian opera singer as we were dropping the things. But that's what was coming to _over the guard_ [reserved emergency radio] _frequency - some opera. It was sort of surred, all of that._

_I think he hit the nail on the head alone when he said it was like a training mission. I mean,

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:44]

crift...no one else in the world has anything like it and the B-2 program paid for that. To have an aircraft you can launch from the Continental United States, fly is Indway around the world to Europe, drop precision bounds within literally get of their targets, and return that bother home - after going into the middle of a very advanced integrated at defense system.... I'm sorry for the American taxporer, for anyone who blinks they didn't get their money's worth. I would have a serious debate with them about that fact._

I'm just glad that we're the ones that got the B-2 and not someone else.

_That's correct because the technology, while expensive, works as advertised. And that's not just a propaganda statement. I believe that from my heart and from you would. We are using lives and we do have a capability that no other country in the world possesses. I's unique and the United States has it.'s the B-2 bomber and I's are Whiteman Air Force Base._

An incredible piece of equipment... What was the ride back like after your first mission?

I mentioned to a friend of mine this story: I was coming back and remember weing the East Coast of America. I was trying to get a clearance to go on the United States and the radios are kind of garbled. I remember hearing a good old-dished New Yorker over the radio and be said, "They say, you just got back, didn't your't said, "Yeah" and he said, "What do you want?" I said, "I want to climb to this attitude and I want off to Whitemen and he said, "You've got if You can have whatever you want." And it was just a nice feeling, hearing a New York voice and a welcome home. It was a great feeling, knowing that we had accomplished our mission and accomplished it safely at you now were returning home to get the jet back to our guys so we could turn it and fly it again the next day.

Once you were back on the ground and you went to your post-flight, did you feel drained?

No. I was still pretty fired up. I mean, we both took a catmap or two. Iglert maybe two hours in my mission. I didn't sleep much.

I _stop nine_.

So it depends. The fighter guys are a little weaker on their sleep needs... no, I'm just kid-ding.

_My Night Twe' was it like different. It's not every combat sortie where the Chief of Staff in my work of the bottom of the ladder before you are done. The question was, "Would you go? like to go he can (CNN) host Larry King". "No hand you." Firepower was very pleated in the early nights that the aircraft was performing so well. When the RDA began coming in, the B-2 was totally neutralized weapons system. When we took off "Simple Two: the gears for "Night One" were just on their targets as we were launching, so we had no idea of fly they were going to get that. We had no idea. We have to passed in the north-Atlantic and to find them a little bit on the radio, that is not so set of new she has had for an. So coming back at Night Twe." we had four data points now that the aircraft was working very, very well. We had four data points that the Joint Direct Attraction (which had had undergone some verification from the small aircraft community) was giving as a better CEP [Cocratic Error of Probability] _I'm_ they had seen in tests. That happened with Shuffle."_ One of Night Twe, we began getting on a _roll_, We were three when other aircraft's there, to the _only nights_ it was was set of._

_everyone was just very happy that the aircraft was doing so well. After approximately the first two weeks, [L1] General [Michel C.]. Short [NATO's air component] said, the B-2 carried the next half. We used... they were then the "bow were happening" after night at night 41 us weather, never making that the weather in Italy was bad. We were made and we were making the real for that particular solar conflict._

_As I said, it's like the aircraft have that they were needed. We were operating with only six aircraft. I wish we were doing it today with 16 B-2s, Again, I come from a small aircraft world so I have to hear it from fighter pilots of this time: "Yeah", _I've got like that part part of our car-only and the B-2 will replace the United States Air Force." We were not saying that, but I will say that with we already were we were delivering the equivalent of an entire **F-16** squadron's production. We were doing it much more accurately than they could out we were doing it compressed and raising forever there was there. Today, with our five B-2s as the target. I could match an aircraft carrier's production for one cycle of the deck. And the aircraft is very reliable. We began this with a question about maintenance, but the aircraft works. Holes, I's highly reliable and when we show up in numbers - four or five of us - we can really bring a lot of punch. It takes a whole lot of aircraft in other contexts..._

During ALLIED FORCE, what was the most unusual type of target?

[Coc] Centre for Institute of Physics, The first edition of the doctoral report of the doctoral report of impost, which contains 50 percent of the republic heospedily involved in this paper.

**Ready for "the big one," the SPBMT OF MSSISSPPI is loaded with sixteen 2000 pounds (907.2 x) GNU-2s. In preparation for loading a B-2, the weapons team assembles each weapons by both load on the respective side of the SPBMT. Each weapons may holds up to eight GNU-2s, which are mounted on Advanced Applications Rotay Launches (ARARs).** (Northrop Grumman)

best option to press for, "Why are you fighting from here?" His words were, "For this particular contingency, this is the best way to do it." Something that simple.

There has been some speculation that the Air Force is looking at forward deploying two or there B-2s.

_That wouldn't surprise me. We are working on a contingency. I's in the open press that we are developing dispoulsed he's to maintain our actual settings. You can't sit outside in driving this, apply this night, and expect to create purely. You're got to get it out of the environment. That doesn't mean that we can't fly in rain - that's not what I said to maintain it. You were to be in a day environment. The sign of \(g\)'s per hour when his, don't know -'s I's I knew's I knew's I have's I have's I have to be in a day environment. Now imagine trying to do that in standing wave._

_That would be difficult to do. So we are developing these dispoulsed shelters. Once they are developed and paid for - when they're can they they have._

_It is more formal. And when we do get the ability to move forward, you will see our ability to produce active go_, what such going closer to the fight. One disadvantage of sitting in the Continental United States and during battle in Europe is that it is a long transit time. But that also gives you unique capability. If the demand never says you can't care was, well, we have a base to fight here in Missouri but can use an eye and the President trusts to run. But the closer we can get to the fight, the better - because that would allow us to produce more stories and that's water are in business to do._

What Harry said is exactly right. Certainly, the deployable shelters will give us the capability to forward go through to many, many locations.

_It is more formal._

_This is a real-world example of a B-2A style against the Kragiewac armament and monitor vehicle plant in Crewa Zastastre, Serbia. A Spirit dropped at least three bombs which hit the plant. During Operation ALILED FORCE, the B-2s dropped 90 percent of their bounds within a 30-det (6.1 u) range from the intended target. (Jim Goodain)_

That's incredible

_It will be a remarkable capability and we haven't figured out the crew side because they would have to be the one to find 800 targets. I can't even farkhor... I's a concept the Intelligence community has fought about how. Where to you put eighty 500 pound bombs in a pass? Because soon we'll have the ability to do it._

I want to cvex on that. It's important that we understand that this whole team effort thing...

I already mentioned some of the initiatives and the other people and the employees of Northern. But look at some of the pilots they picked for this program. You've got a bunch of fighter says and bomber songs why've come from their own worlds of how they do business. Now you've combined them together, and together we've matured this weapons system beyond what I believe they were even thinking about. You get some billiard people that have these ideas and they make the ideas happen. You take into account Space Command and the benefits of space and GPS with these weapons and our actual... You combine all that together with these pilots that like to think outside the box sometimes, and you've got yourself one back of a fighting force with the B-2.

## Operation ENDURING FREEDOM

The unthinkable happened on 11 September 2001, when a group of Islamic fundamentalistic double bombers attacked the United States. The terrorists hijacked four American-built Boeing commercial airliners, with two of the aircraft from into the twin towers of New York City's World Trade Center. The towers burned and later collapsed, burying thousands of people in the rubble. A third airliner hit the Pentagon, the Department of Defense headquarters in Washington, while a fourth - intended for either the White House of the Caputi in Washington - was from into a field in western Pennsylvania. Following the rangle death of over 3500 innocent victims, the destruction of the World Trade Center's twin towers, and a direct hit on the Pentagon, America quickly transformed from a somewhat fractured, disinterested populous into a _nature united_.

US authorities soon found evidence linking the terrorist network at-Qaeda - led by Saudi-born terror misdoyan Basin Laaden - to the 11 September attacks. Afghanistan's fundamentalist Talling regime provided sanctuary to bin Lacden and his organization. The US armed forces prepared a campaign code named Operation ENDURING FREEDOM to bring down the Yalton government and to destroy a-Qaeda.

Operation ENDURING FREEDOM technically began on 5 October 2001 just after 1100 hours Eastern Standard Time (EST) - nearly two hours before President George W. Bush spoke to the nation from the Treaty Room at the White House. Four American cars, u US submarine, and a British submarine began firing salvos of cruise missiles towards al-Qaeda and Talinat targets in Afghanistan. Afghan sources reported the initial blass occurring at 1227 hours EST (2057 hours local Afghan time).

## Range of B-2 with One Inflight Refueling

(From Whiteman AFB, Diego Garcia, and Andersen AFB)

Early on 5 November, six 500th Bonn Wing (BW) B-2As left Whiteman Air Force Base (AFB), Missouri for the 7500-mile (12,069.8 xm) non-stop flight to Afghanistan. At approximately 1230 hours EST on 6 October (24 hours after the initial cruise missile strikes), the B-2 crossbar the Afghan border and began attacking Taliban and al-Qaeda installations. The Spirits bombed their targets from 50,000 feet (15,240 xm) using 2000 pound (097.2 xm) GRU-367B satellite-guided rulunitions.

The weapons-loading teams at Whiteman sent poignant messages from America to the terrorists. "NYPD", "FUND"2," and "Don't Iread On Me" were written on a good number of the Guided Bomb Units (GBUs) loaded about the B-2 bombers. These messages were in memory of the many police officers, firefighters, rescue workers, and military personnel killed in the attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon.

Footnote 2: NYPD: New York Police Department

The flight from Whiteman AFB to Afghanistan required six aerial refueling. Following competition of their bombing missions over Afghanistan, the B-2s landed - approximately 40 hours after akoffer - at the British/US military facility on Diego Garcia in the central Indian Ocean. There, the two-man crew were rotated, the tablets emptied, and then reiter every police and the B-2s on either 30 hour return flight back to Whiteman. According to the 509th Bonn Wing Commander, Brig. Gen. Anthony F. Pzybyslawski, the aircraft returned home 'Code One' with no maintenance write-ups. This meant the aircraft were mechanically sound and ready to fly again. _The fact there are several hours that their engines on more than 70 hours highlights the durability and reliability of this weapons system_, "Pzybyslawski stated.

Prozybyslawski declared that the Spirits had met no resistance while flying wave Afghanistan. _"Four simple words describe their analysis: global strike, precision engagement. The B-2's combination of such technology, long range, large payload, and precise animations makes it the world's most capable long-range bomber,"_. The said. _"But the B-2's just an aircraft until you add people. We have America's best, flying, maintaining and supporting this aircraft. I couldn't be prouder of these people."_

## Where is Diego Garcia?

Diego Garcia is part of the British Indian Ocean Territory (BIOT) established in 1965. It is one of 56 islands in the Chicago Archipelago, which extends over an area of 22,000 square miles (56,975.6 xm) in the board of the Indian Ocean, south of India and between Africa and Indonesia.

This tropical island is a narrow coral atoll with a land area of approximately 11 square miles (28.5 xm), nearly enclosing a lagoon. Its configuration is like that of a 'V' drawn by a shaky hand, stretching 34 miles (54.7 xm) in length with the opening facing north-northwest. Three small islands due the month of the lagoon, which is approximately 13 miles (20.9 xm) long and spreads up to six miles (97.7 xm) in width. The water's depth ranges from 60 to 100 feet (18.3 to 30.5 xm) and is scattered with coral heads. Shallow reefs surround the island on the ocean side as well as protect the lagoon itself. Diego Garcia's mean height above sea level is a mere four feet (1.2 xm).
