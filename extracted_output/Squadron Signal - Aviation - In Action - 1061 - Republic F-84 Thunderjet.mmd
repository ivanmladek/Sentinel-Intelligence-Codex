Introduction

During World War ii, a name that was synonymous with heavily-armed fighter aircraft capable of both disabling it out and taking everything the enemy gave, was Republic Arabia Corporation. Republic was the descendent of Severwards Aircraft Corporation headed the legendary Major Alexander P. Severwards. The Severwards design team, led by Alexander Karlsen has been responsible for such ramous designs as the Severwards P.35 and P.38, the Republic P.4.7, and P.4.8, are the F.105.

The Karwell team had a stack for going against the tide, for picking the wrong equipment, putting it in the wrong airframe, and coming up with the third design at the right time. During June of 1940, while Hitter's Panzer Divisions, under the protection of the Luffuestre, were killing Untiguous France; at a time when all of the other major US aircraft manufacturers were busy designing aircraft around the new Alison liquid-cooled Vee-12 in-line engine, with a small frontal area and streamlined nose, the Karwell team decided to a supervised radial arcloed engine and design at an arcloed engine at arcloed time around it. Using the Wraff and Whitmore R.2800 Double Ways as its heart, the Karwell team came up with a design that would eventually become the scouture of triat's panzers, while more than holding its own against the turchet further. It was big, heavy, and rather unstencimating.

But it was trapped, overpowered and could be a very nasity wide. It was the P.47 Thunderbolt.

With the introduction of jet aircraft into the combat arena over Europe, a crash program to bring the United States into the competition was begun. Bell Aircraft Corporation was the first successful US manufacturer to deliver a jet-englared aircraft of the US Armod Forces -- the X9.59 Aircom. Locked Aviation followed quickly with the P.80 Snoofting Star. Both aircraft were powered by centrifugal low gas turbine engines. The Karwell team was instructed by the Army Air Force to design an aircraft around the new General Electric T-6108 Airsoft twotieth engine. Against, Karwell's team was going against the industry'mmor,' being the already successful Locked P.80 Shooting and, and the new German XPM Parither were powered by the centrifugal-flow Allison 133 engine. However, use of the axial-flow TG-160 would mean a slight reduction in drag through a more streamlined twealge, and better fuel economy, something the early jets were not known for.

The Army Air Force General Operational Requirement (GOR) called for a "mid-wing day fighter aircraft" with a top speed of 600 mph and a combat radisu of 850 mises. The aircraft would have a weight 500 Caloror M2 manehinegas as its main armant, and would be designated the X9-4. With the GOR in mind, Karwell's team initially attempted to mate the new jet in a middle-94 Trupted aircraft. Several design studies were done in an attempt to streamline the "Jup" enough to meet the GOR. Finally, in October of 1944, Republic abandoned the idea of a jet powered Thunderbolt in favor of an all new design design. On 11 November 1944, the Army Air Force officially accepted the all new design and authorized Republic to build the Wraff-44 Airness. No competition was held between the 9-80, the X9-4, and the X9-8, since each was significantly better than the other several agent in development (the P.80 was already in production, and the P.86 wouldn't fix two more years).

The X9-4 model-way was unveiled at the Farmodization, long Island giant in February 1945, Army Air Force linked the new X-9.84 so well that a further contract was set calling for 256 talent aircraft (P.648A) and 257 production aircraft (P.648A). The contract was later to 1579-848 and 59-648A. The new design no resemblance at all to the proposed jet-englared Thunderbolt. The new twealge was long and slender with the jet-like being in the nose, and the cockal area entirely formed of the wing. The landing gear was of the threeicycle water, meaning the aircraft had a nosewheel instead of a tailwater. In the main gear that extremely long long rashing the aircraft still yet last, a nice feature for taxing. As with the Thunderbolt, the main landing gear hydraulically collapsed so as to fit into as small a bay as possible. Another new feature was the engine being art of the wing, with the entire rear fuselge being unnoticed for complete removal during engine

P.84B

The first production aircraft, the P.84B, was very similar to the VP-84A8 but was armed with six M3.50 caliltive machinegions in place of the M2 guns in the VP aircraft. The M3 had a rate of rise of 1200 rounds per minute - 400 rounds per minute faster than the M2 gun in addition, the B model incorporated an injection seat which the pilot was not authorized to use), a pair of 230 gallo singluity fuel tanks, and retractable underlowing rocket launch status and bomb pylons.

In November 1974, the latth Fighter Group, based at Dow Field, Maine, became the first unit to begin operations in the new P.84B-16, The P.84 series was officially named "Thunder-1970" by Repetitive during the Fall of 1986. It was the second aircraft in a long line of Republic aircraft that would bear the "Thunder-name" in 1984, by Congressional Act, the US Air Force became a separate service from the Army and Nave. One of the first things the Air Force obtains off was to eliminate the term "Pursuit" from the Air Force vocabulary.

PlusPlus present became "Fighter" planes. Thus the P.84 series was redesignated to F.84 in 13 June 1984.

Problems within the P.84 program began to mount as the P.84B began to enter service.

Trim reversal, baseline skin strikes, lack of spare parts and supplies, and poorly trained maintenance creeses will contributed to the Thunderiger's nickname of Mechanics Nightname. The problems culminated in the grounding of the entire F.84 fleet on 24 May 1986, following some rather serious accidents resulting from various structural failures. After all the aircraft were inspected and declared abruptly, they were again placed on flight status - but with limits. All aircraft were limited to 0.80 Mach top speed; and 'G' loads were limited to 5.5.

In June 1986, the last of 25 F.84B-84A8 came off the F.7ammida production line. The original P.84B contract had been for 500 aircraft, however, after all the changes to correct problems in the P.84 series, Any Air Force decided that the remaining 274 aircraft on the contract should be completed as P.84C and Os. The average fuzzy cost of the P.84B program was 325,500,000 per aircraft. In May 1984, an S.8 million modification program brought out to F.84B-8 up to structural standards of the rest of the F.84 fleet by reinforcement of the aircraft's wings and making over a hundred other internal modifications. Even with all the modifications, the F.84B-8 were rapidly phased out of active Air Force service.

Finally, in late 1982, the last F.84B was phased out of service with the Air National Guard.

The F-84D was the first really significant variant in the F-84 program. The F-84D was powered by the much more powerful Ailison 3J5-A17D engine rated at 5000 hs, static Hurst. With the extra thrust available, Republic could afford to strengthen the basic F-84 airframe. The wing skin was increased in thickness from 72 to 06. The main landing gear starts, compressed by hydraulic means in the F-84D and C, were now compressed mechanically through a step to between the wing and the gear closure piston. Both the Air Force and the Navy had settled on a standardized set of radio consoles and these were added to the F-84D cockpit layout. Lightweight fuel cells, saving 120 kps, were installed. The nose armchair by door was changed from a fully renewable panel to a forward-highdown door. The height seat, which had been installed in the earlier variants but had never been cleared for use, was finally decelerated safe. Additional, the pilot tube was moved from the leading edge of the vertical fit, in the time any tighter inside the nose

Beginning in November 1958, the first of 154 F-84D began arriving. However, two monitors prior to the first F-84D delivery, the Air Force almost cancelled the entire F-84 program. The Air Force and conducted a study into the F-84D program and all the problems associated with it. It was officially found that neither for F-84D and the F-84D could "satisfactorily meet" phase of the missions of the major commands - The Air Force could have cancelled the entire program at that point. However, it was pointed out that production of the F-84D had progressed so far that almost half of the money spent on the F-84D program could not be the returned.

The Air Force called for a major test program to conclude whether the F-84D would be a more cost-effective aircraft than the previous variants. The tests would also determine whether the F-84 was a better flight aircraft than the Lockheed F-80. The tests were conducted between 2 February 6 March 1958 and the results were conclusive. The F-84D was a far better aircraft than either of the Fair F-84 variants, and the F-84D was also heard and shoulders above the F-80. The F-84D was faster, had a greater change, better acceleration, a higher rate of climb, and could carry a much greater payload than the Shooting Star. The F-84D would become the standard Air Force fighter-bomber in the early

The reliability and maintainability of the F-84D was so greatly enhanced over previous variants that may remained in service with Air National Guard through the windway (1959), while all previous F-84 types were retired by 1953. Additional improvements were made throughout the production of the F-84D. These included canopy removed to facilitate fast test after the aircraft, wintering the fuel system, and the addition of fixed, but jet-disstable, both DRLs in place of the retracheled rackus found on earlier models. A serious stability problem was corrected when small triangular fires were added to the unighty tanks. After a series of crashes resulting from wing failure, it had been found that the tip tank actually began to be found in the unighty windspeed exceeds 0.70 Mach. With the addition of the small fires, the F-84D, and all other models retrofitted with the tip tank fins, could now be from maximum speed - with without tip tanks.

The F-84D was the first of its type to be deployed to beussels outside the United States. F-84D and models were not assigned to overseas bases due to the extremely short maintenance life of the early versions of the 3J5 engine - only 40 hours between overheads! Several F-84Ds were in the inventory of the 27th fighter Escort Group when it deployed to Korea in the Winter of 1950. In 1958, with fighter-bomber losses in Korea mounting at an alarming rate, the Air Force sent a further 102 F-84Ds to the war close to replenish the depleted units. Most of these aircraft went to the 136th Fighter-Bomber Group. The last F-84Ds were phased out of Air National Guard service in late 1957. The cost of the F-84D program was $212,241.00 plus engine, electronics and armament.

F-84E

With the F-84E the Thunderieffier finally lived up to the specifications originally drawn up in the 1944 General Operational Requirements. The F-84E was powered by the Allison J35-A-17D engine, the same as in the F-84E. But that is where the resemblance ended. An additional 12 inches was added to the fuselage length in the cocktail area of the pilots contract. Fortunately at Kastelack T-to-H (44D) rocks are added to the underside of the rear Tuselage. The use of 44D meant that the gross task weight could be raised to 2400 hours. In that level the peak was increased and the underlying bomb protons were modified to handle an additional pair of 230 gallo solar torus in place of bombs. Combat engines, with a pair of 1000 bombs and using a J47D tower, was extended to 1485 miles. Service ceiling was 4322 feet to speed up a production Thunderieffie exceeded 600 mph for the first time, with the F-84E table able to do an honest 613 mph A, Sherry A-18 radar quasiround out the rear T-84E package.

First flight of the F-84E was achieved in 1887 1948, with USAF accepting the first production aircraft as days later. Frobenius still doped the F-84E program, although the airframe itself was generally acceptable. The Sherry A-18 radar quasiround proved unreliable and F-84E codebooks was held up until the New F-84E system became available. The 71D engine was susceptible to all types of problems and by await 1950 mph (50% of the aircraft were flying due to engine parts shortages. Some F-84EBs in the Far East Force were later filled with initial refueling probes in the tip tank rooses which increased the range almost infinitely.

The last 643 648-648 rolled off the assembly line in July 1951. The US Air Force accept 743 and used the remaining 100 aircraft to various NTO countries, mainly France. Even with the many changes incorporated in the F-84E, the cost remained exactly the same as the F-84E-7, F-84EEs were involved in many Titsits including the first nonsolup jet initial across the Atlantic, and the first initial refueling of operational combat aircraft. The last F-84EEs were phased out of ANGAFARS service in mid-1959.

F-84E cockpit. As with other early USAF jet fighter aircraft, the F-84 cocktail was Black with interior Green testage walls and floor, US fighter aircraft went to an Interior Grey paint scheme in 1952. (USAF).

With the much more powerful J35-A-17D engine and J4TO bottles attached to the underside of the rear tuselage, the F-84E was capable of lifting some prodigious loads. This aircraft is from the Egin AFB Air Proving Ground and is carrying a pair of 1200 lb. Tiny Tim rockets, plus eight batteries of three 5 inch rockets. (USAF)F-84G

The F-84G was the last straight-wing variant in the F-84 series. Next on the production line was to be the swept up F-84F series. In fact, the last last fiscal-84F-84G, serial 94-2430, was completed with swept uping and tall surfaces and served as the prototype for the F-84F series. However, extensive problems with the swept up F-84F, coupled with the F-84F's period for a lighter-bometer aircraft with the capability of delivering nuclear weapons, led to a contact for Republic to a straight wing "interinter flight" capable of carrying nuclear weapons - the F-84G. Eventually, more of these "inter flight" Thunderleits could be built in turn any other variant. The final production law could be 3.035, with 789 going to the US AF Force and the remainder going to nations with mutual defense agents with the third States.

The F-84G differed from the other variants by using the 5600 lb. In thrust Allison 335-A29. This increased the two speed to 622 mph and the unrestricted range jumped to 2000 miles. It was the first fighter designed to carry and deliver nuclear weapons. It was also the first flight aircraft designed to make an initial retueling recoiler making it compatible with the newly developed Beong Flying Room finlight reducing system. An autopilot was incorporated to take further advantage of the increasing in range, it was on the F-84G that the familiar braking on the canopy first appeared. These changes were later introduced in all previous F-84 models.

In August 1951, the first production aircraft began ramping. The 31st Flight Execor Control Suite, at Wattner AFF, Agenda, was the first unit to operational in the F-84G. Deliverates to the 5th Air Force in Korea began in the Summer of 1952. Operational tests of the extremely long periods of the F-84G began in July 1952 when it passed through 1952 when it passed through 1953 when it passed through 1953 when it passed through 1954. For later year, the one aircraft returned with K-82P filters exnute. The code name was Operation For Fate Detectors, the one and the aircraft returned with K-82P filters exnute. In October 1952, Fote Peter Tse met the 27m FEW be Long to the Far East from Bergstrom, Texas, and in August 1953, under General Logistics, the 58th FEW flew from Turner AFF to Bestwaters.

After base in England, and the 31st FEW flew from Turner to Stoll Simane as in French Morocco, reducing over the Atlantic from SACG KOF markers. The US Air Force was demonstrating to the entire world that they could deliver nuclear devastation on a tactical level, to any part of the world as time.

The F-84G are some with no less than a dozen air forces throughout the free world, and counting the US Air Force. Only three European nations did not equip with the F-84G (-) Great Britain West Germany, Spain. Two of those nations would instead equip with the North American F-84G (-) Sabric, while the third, West Germany would have both the 84th and its swept uping of the F-84G undernates. Oddly, or 8643 saw quite severe with the US Air National Guard.

The flyway cost of the F-84G was as follows: airframe-$237,247.00; engine (installed\({}^{\dagger}\)44,480.00; electronics\({}^{\dagger}\)47,100; armarA 421st Air Relueling Squadron KB-2SP tanker refuels a 49th F60p F-84dG carrying a practice Mark 7 nuclear bomb. Even though the F-84dG was designed to accept the Boeing "fliping boom" method of inflation refueling, the aircraft of the Far East Air Force continued to use the "probe and droog" method due to the fact that no flying boom lunar aircraft were available in the Far East, The F-84dG was the first fighter aircraft designed to carry nuclear weapons.

F-84F Thunderstreak

With the tremendous success of the swept-wing North American F-86 Saber, Republic's design team, again let by Alexander Kurtzel, began planning a swept-wing fighter of their own. Consequently in late 1949, a standard F-86F fuselage (94-2430) was mated to a pair of wings swept back at 40 degree angle. The horizontal and vertical tail surfaces were also swept back. The remainder of the two areiract, actually about 60% of the total airframe, retained its straight-wing heritage.

Under the design/tip-6AaH7aH7aH8a the prototype rolled out of the Farm-upside factory in late May 1950. It had taken by 40 days to construct. The swept wing was all new, as was the swept back trail surfaces. The canopy was mildly changed by the addition of a vahaped windscreen to help out the air. The aircraft was designated the YF-96A and, owing to its greater speed over the straight-wing thunderstett, it was named the Thunderstett. Unfortunately the airframe and engine designs would allow a top speed of only 658 mph, far short of the Air Force requirements. The aircraft made its first flight on 3 June 1960.

The TF-84G inflight over Edwards AFB during the summer of 1950. The TF-96A had a stand-dard F-86F fuselage but had swept wing and tail surfaces. Note the \(\nu\)-shaped windscreen similar to that found on the F-86A Saber. (AFM)

The first TF-84F on the Edwards AFB ramp in 1952. Note the 6 inch vertical spread throughout the length of the fuselage needed to both accommodate and supply air to the new X-65-8-3 engine. The vahaped windscreen was removed from the TF-84F prototypes in favor of a new flat armored glass windscreen. (Wm. J. Balogh)Republic wanted to go ahead with further research and eventual _F-98A_ production, much as they had done with the trouble-plagued F-84 series. But the Air Force could not finance such a project due to Congressional budget cuts in defense spending. The Air Force needed all their funds to purchase the proven F-84 Gabriel, now rolling off North American assembly lines. The swept-wing Thunderstreas project would be saved by a very unlikely air -- the North Korean Communists.

On 25 June 1950, North Korean Communists and troops rolled across the 36th parallel ten nearly defensive South Korea. It shocked the entire Free World, The Soviet Union really did want world domination, and was willing to use force to obtain its goals. The US Congress immediately began adding funds to various defense budgets.

The top top time projects was that of the swap-ing _F-98A_ Thunderstreas. However, since it was much easier for the Air Force to obtain money to further develop an existing air, in September 1950, Air Force redeagulated the swept-wing design from YY-96A. Thunderstreas to YY-96A. Thunderstreas. A similar decision at North American Aviation resulted in the F-98A shared Intercept becoming the F-840 Sebure.

With the influx of funds for the new project, Republic began looking for ways to in release the aircraft's performance. It was felt that a totally new, more powerful engine was needed, rather than further development of the Allison 35. The British Armstrong, Stoyde, Espine engine, at 7200 hs, thrust was chosen to power the FF-84F. Curtis-Wight would release build the engine under the designation Y-458W-1. A later version, the Y-458 G.8, a built by Sluck, MUC Division of General Motors.

Since the 365 Sapphire was bigger, and required more than at the 335, the intake area for the FF-84F was to be required even inches. Republic carried this seven then spread throughout the entire fuselage, then, of theaxy was changed from a sliding full bubble style, to a full classical type that swung upward and back on three hingged arms. In addition, at that removed slugs windowed replaced the v-shaped windscreen of the prototype. A larger signal latting fan from the new canopy to the vertical tail. The dye brakes were moved from the underside of the steeting to a large door - type brake on each side of the art telescope. Amramment remained the same with four 30-50 calting machines in the west open area, and an additional part mounted in the wing roads.

Two F-84F pre-production prototypes were built. Each was radically different from the two. The _F-84F_ S1-134 was built around the 365 engine and incorporated most of the design features that would be found on production aircraft. The No 2 prototype, serial 15-154, was built with a fully closed, streamlined so does, with the air intakes mounted in the wing out location edges. The design was skewed when it was discovered that the wing root leaf makes cost many pounds in thrust, which obviously meant a loss in top 84F and actually about 200 m. The design would be rewired later in the program for a reconnaissance version of the F-84F. The No.1 prototype FF-84F flew with 405 power for the first time on 14 February 1950.

Teebing problems with the 456 and production follows at Republic set the program has many months. These extended delays are with prompted the Air Force to go ahead and purchase the upgraded straight-wing interim model (F-84G) to fill their tactical nuclear stroke force. Eventually, the 456F-spring engine almost totally redesigned to meet F-84F requirements. The new design was the 65-W3 wind belts Verkis/Wight, and 456-59 h-59 hung with by Burke. Arfiring problems came from a design decision to use heavy ionings in the main year of the main. An excellent concept, the problem is in the fact that only one such foreign press was available, and it was already in use making B-F7 assigns, which had a much higher priority than the F-84F. The basic white structure had to bedesigned to make use of variable production tooling.

All of this took time at least 1/8uart will November 1952 that the first production F-84F Thunderstreas rolled out of Farmingdale. The aircraft, F-84F-1 serial S1-134es, first on 22 November 1952. The first 1752 aircraft were all powered by the Curtis-Wight 2700, in which W-1 powerful. But all aircraft that followed had either the Wright or Quick-3 engine. Production aircraft began arriving at operational units in early 1953, out large quantities were not produced until late 1953 when engine production finally caught up with arfiring production.

Problems within the F-84F continued throughout its career; causing time consuming modifications both on the production line and in the field. The aircraft's longitudinal and lateral control systems were inadequate at high Mach numbers. A stabilator, or all-moving horizontal tail was the answer. But these would not be available in quantity until 1954. A quick-fix was authorized. If involved interconnections the horizontal tailbuster are elevators. Call the "poor" arms' fixing it, was fitted to many production aircraft, after various accidents were traced directly the poor arm's flight, Air Force.

directed that the modification be stopped and removed from all aircraft. Other problems with the landing guard-up system, over-sensitive hydraulic and electrical emergency systems, and still more reforms with the 456 engine, eventually led the Air Force to first ground the entire F-84F flew, and then suspects drivers of new aircraft in mid-1954. After inspection of the entire fleet, a new program, called Project RUN in was maintained to check the suitability of the F-84F to fulfill the Air Force mission as laid down in the original General Operational Requirement. In November 1954, the F-84F passed to tests and Republic was once again in the airplane business. All aircraft that had been in storage at Republic during the suspension were delivered by March 1955. Production was further increased when General Motors was given a contract to build F-84Fs at their plant in Kansas City. The GM-built aircraft were identified as F-84F-GKs.

Although the bands were intended as quick identification bands, similar to the O-Oxy stripes of World War II, no general pattern has been observed as to their application. (Jourdan)The RF-84F Thunderflash

The need for a high speed photo reconnaissance aircraft was a direct result of experiences gained during the Korean conflict. Korea pointed up the need for a reconnaissance aircraft which would be able to either evade an enemy, or engage and defeat him. The enemy would be the Soviet Union, or one of its alleles, and they would be equi-prints with Mid 61 interreactions, including the Mid-5's which easily handled all the recon types used in Korea. The Air Force headed a recon aircraft with twice the range, and another 100 m long speed. The RF-84Fault could fill these requirements.

The reconnaissance version of the RF-84Fault actually evolved from the No. 2.0 prototype VF-84F, which had the slender, pointed nose with an air intakes embedded in the wing rotators. Although the concept had been abandoned on a fighter-type aircraft because of a loss of thrust from the design of the wing rotators it was, the Air Force and Republic Aviation found the design for a reconnaissance version. The Tithes were enlarged, as was the wing itself, and the pointed nose grew way to a slender, somewhat blurred nose that could house six cameras. In addition, four 83.60 embartic neighbours were mounted under the outer edge of the wing rotators like, RF-84F pilots would not be "Aione, Unarmed, and Unarmed." Weid, at least they wouldn't be unarmed. Engine, Right control systems, coorbit and convey, and the landing were air shared with the RF-84F.

Sharing so many common paths with the fighter-bounce version also meant the RF-84F, share the submarine provision associated with the entire 84-84F program. During profing problems led to a four month delay between delivery of the second production aircraft, in September 1953, and the third, which did not fall out until January 1954. In April 1954, "Hot" ships with 1956-83's engine set the RF-84F program back at full eighteen months. It was assumed that November 1955, when sufficient quantities of the RF-84F engine became available, that RF-84F production resumed. The first unit to become operational was the 1956-874 Technical Reemanhouse Wing at Shara AFB, S. Carolina, in March 1954. Actually only one year south within the 386M covered the RF-84F. The remaining two squads extending their RF-84F sources, but all personnel from the other two squads were rotated through the RF-84F solution in anticipation of compensation of the entire wing.

The US Military Assistance Program (MAR) also sent RF-84F aircraft to its allies, Naturally, almost all the RF-84F was not to NAT, this being politically correct as they are also flying the fighter-bounce version of the same aircraft. Germany received two squads, while France, The Netherlands, Denmark, Norway, Greece, and Turkey got one squadron edge. In the Far East, only, National China opted for the RF-84F, and Japan and South Korea buying RF-84F. Shapes, which were compatible with their tighter arms equipped with F-84F ([https://nul.gal/](https://nul.gal/)). RF-84F serves built for MAR sales to other nations. The US Air Force bought a total of 386 before production ceased in December 1957.

In December 1955, the Strategic Air Command began equipping the 17st StateStade reconnaissance Wing (Fighter), with RF-84Fs and specially built RF-84Fs. The RF-84F was modified as-84F capable of an inflation brought with a GRB-36 mother ship. The GR-83o would carry the grant-84F to the target area, drop him to perform his mission, then retrieve the fighter and bring him home. The project was called fighter CDNreport, or FICION. The RF-84F and a large hydraulic hook attached to the upper part of the nose, directly infront the windscreen. An added pair of hooks were fitted to the upper portion of the offset of the baseline. One half the RF-84F to clear the B-83o bomb by the horizontal shalistiches were angled down at 45 degrees from the horizontal. The project had been tested in 1952 with a straight-wing F-84E in 1953, the original VR-84F prototype, serial 49-2430, was modified with the retrieving apparatus and droposing stabilators. It flee for the first time on 30 mech 1953, with FICON nests continuing until 1955 when production aircraft began arriving. The 1951 SRSs, and Larson AFB, Washington, received 25 RF-84F FICON aircraft. They were teamed with the GRR-38Ons from the 348H BSq based at Fair Fair Fairchild AFB, Washington.

* _For additional Information on the Ficon program see Squadron Signal Aircraft in Action No. 42 B-36 in Action._

Tactical An Command replaced its RF-84Fs, including the ones inherited from SAK, in 1958 with McDonnell RF-101 Voodoodos. Most of the RF-84FKs were sent to Air National Guard units. Seven squads were operational in the Guard. When the Berlin Crisis erupted in 1956, it 17TH Tactical Reconsiansee Wing, Alabama Air Guard, was activated for possible service in Europe. When the crisis was devised, they and their aircraft were turned to the control of the State of Alabama. Rapid replacement of RF-10ICs in the Air Force by the McDonnell-Doupias RF-84F Phantom brought a supersonic capability for the Air Guard recent effort. The RF-10 Voodos replaced the RF-84Fs in Guard service, defined the last operational RF-84F to the Davis-Montan aircraft storage and column facility. The cutters torch would write the final chapter to the RF-84F story.

## Korea

When North Korean tanks and troops crossed the 38th parallel into South Korea on-line 1960, 1 began three violent years of conflict during which neither side actually gained anything. Initially, 5th Air Force brass concluded that the main forces present in the Far East were more than sufficient to handle the emergency in Korea. Nothing newer than the Lockheeded "Face-Socothing Star would be needed to schedule the fledging North Korean Air Force, which was comprised of propeller-driven Soviet Korea-TAX-fragues, some re-sure. So neither 801-893 (803 dollars during South Ware in Vander Land-Cas, and a few 11 years) youth1-10 Stormway group attack places. The North Korean had no jet aircraft any fourth during the Summer of 1960.

In November 1950, the situation changed - and with the strategy of 5th Air Force. On the 1960, six weeks were 1960, six weeks were 1961 triggers rose from the runaway at at time to intercept a controlling flight of 6th Air Buffer Border Group & F-510 MMs. The Soviet MG-15, best after the nominal surmest, are the battle. System days later, after sixty-Millines with the new led jets, six Air Force requested use of the two best aircraft in the West West - the North American -680 Sare and the Republic of 746-Marquet. Sare exploits in Korea became legend. They found and disulphened the Mid Force at a ten to one ratio. The Throneletts get to Korea and dither job with very little fanate. But within 5th Air Force they became known as the "Champs of the Border Force" in Korea. The Joint Chiefs of Staff notified the Strategic Air Command to prepare the 27th fighter Escort Group for overseas movement in 9 November 1950, on the same day, the 4th Flight Finger Interceptor Group was asserted to present their Sakers. In a similar fashion, both units base-hopped across the United States, stopping at bases equipped with their type of aircraft and pick up the best aircraft to go to Korea. The 27th FEGO loaded their F-840S Monte-17hropletts aboard the USW Durham Bay at San Diego, which would transport the entire unit to Yokosaka, Japan. Two weeks later, the carrier docked at Yokosaka, where the aircraft were off loaded onto barges and transported across the harbor to Kisera Air Base to be put back into flying condition. Although many aircraft were seriously damaged from all spray corrosion, the 27th was able to begin flying combat missions from Teago on 6 December 1950, a full eleven days before the 4th FIQ flow their first Sare combat sweep.

Although new the equal to the Mid-15, the F-84 was just fast enough, and just maneuverable enough, to usually evade trouble. These characteristics were greatly enhanced by the much better pilot training program that this Air Force officers were through before joining a combat unit. Many times the F-84s were used in the bomber sector, the mission that SAC had trained them for. But both the F-84s and the B-28s they were executing, needed 8-68s flying to cover the Mid-83 managed to break through the Sather to cover the hits and the F-84s points to do against them. The Motis were simply too fast. The Throneletts themselves, had to have Sather to cover it a fighter-billion mission mission and laid out for MI3.

Throughout the year year 5th Air Force was constantly operating and extending their fighter-borne face, through the conversion on existing unit into F-84s, or by adding another F-84 unit to the theater inventory. And here in these the tail of the rankings dilemma regarding the F-84 force in Korea, With 5th Air Korea constantly hitting F-84 units and out for Korea, and from one to another in Korea, or adding another squadron to the inventory, markings information became very muddied. And now personnel quite often did not have the time, or the energy, to change the unit identification transitions on the aircraft. Thus, they would simply adopt the previous unit's markings as their own, or make some minor change to differentiate one unit from the other.

When the Reds accelerated the war in Korea through the use of the Mid-15, the US SH Air Forces counted by sending 27th FRep 6-40Sue Throneletts and 4th FIQ F-84S Sufaces to the front. The Thronelet, although no match for the much faster MO-15, would become "Champion of the fighter-Bombers in Korea". (USAF)An _F-446_ from the 136th F8GD, an Air National Guard unit activated during the Korean War. This aircraft has over 1000 combat hours and 400 combat missions as denoted by the Red bomb markers on the nose. The nose ring, tail stripe, and arrow on the winging tank is insignid Red. (USAR)

(Right) Figure pilots talk with their hands. 1st LL Arthur Olgher and Captain Harry Underwood describe the action when they shared a MIGO-15-kill in July 1951. Both pilots are with the 136th F8GD. Thunderstjet pilots shot down the MIGO-15-lasting the Korean War (USAR). All major maintenance on the F-446s in Korea was performed at the RECCO (Rear Echelon Maintenance Combined Operations) facility at Itaanke AR, Japan. The alt fusedige sections have been removed and the engines taken to another area for testing and rebuilding. The amannet bay is in the upper nose, while the battery hangs down behind the nose gear well. (USAR)For example, the 27th FEGp arrived in Korea with F-64Ds and Es in December 1960. Their unit 10m markings were a diagonal stripe on the vertical and horizontal stabilizer in the squanton color. Additionally, the nose ring and an added flash, plus an arrow on the side of each night, have also pointed in the squanton color. When they were defined of Hay 1951 by the 36th Fighter-Bomero Grop, an activated At National Guard until the 136th cross simply adopted the 27th Group markings as their own, and added a squadron magma each to store aircraft. When the 36th was returned to state control in July 1952, it was a paper transfer. The unit was simply renumbered the 58th Fighter Bomero Grop. The aircraft, and many of the Air Guard crosses remained in Korea. These cores added a simple Black trim line to all the existing markings, and removed the 36th unit 6canks. Now add to this heat that both the 47th FEGp and 58th FEGp were part of the SCB SWG, with an actual being interchanged in all the time, and one begins to see the problems associated with tiny to 10earth air aircraft in a photo by the markings on the aircraft. It was possible to see a photo of the ramp at 1953, and see every possible bit malaria - and still be looking at only one group aircraft.

By far, and SHG made that F-64g equipped groups – the 49th FEGp, which had transitioned from F-60Cs from F-64Es during the Spring of 1951; the 47th FEGp, which had behind crossed the 11st FEGp, another activated At Guard until 16canks in late-July 1951, and the 88th FEGp. Two other F-640s units were on daily in Japan for various periods during the saw. Both were the result of SAC testing the new long legs of its lighter arm with multiple traveling capability. One Question Fox Peter, the 33rd FEGp flew from Turner 6-B, Georgia to Misawa, Japan in July 1952. The following October. Operation Fox Peter was low the 27th FEGp, we developed Donald Donselise, from Bergstrom AFB, Texas, to Misawa. Both units were assigned to the Japan Air Defense Force.

Inflighting of F-64Es was not new as they F-64Es with experimental British Institut Re Reutling Ltd., processed in the leading edge of the port using for connection with an intelligent refuge routine training behind British Lancaster transfer aircraft, that flow non-stop from England to the US 22nd September 1950. The probe and group system was authorized for combat testing in Korea under the innocent code frame of Project IIT. The aircraft and cross came from the 1st18FGBp, which was still based at Misawa while awaiting equipment orders to Korea. This time the refueling probes were mounted in the wingbus range of 5-46Cs. Only the ing lands could be reduced. The K-29F tanker aircraft came from the 43rd Air Heating Squadron, Detachment 4, which was attached to the 91st Strategic Recon Squadron at Yokota.

The first combat mission took place on 29 May 1952 after many simulated missions had been flown around Japan. The mission was staged through Itzukue AB, Japan, about as close to Korea as possible. Twelve aircraft were loaded with 500 lb, bombs and took off for North Korea. Their target was the industrial complex in and around the town of Sarixion, about 500 miles north of Itzukue. After attacking the targets, the F-64Es headed for the 49th FEGp. The 49th FEGp has a 500 miles north of Itzukue. After attacking the targets, the F-64Es head is 500 miles north of Itzukue. After attacking the targets, the F-64Es head is 500 miles north of Itzukue.

waiting tankers over Tague, Nine aircraft completed the hookup and went home to Johnson AB, Japan. Three aircraft had to land at Tague, two did not have enough fuel to complete the retueling hookup, while the third was forced down when the marker noise broke. Three more missions were flown by the 116th H TIDE cross; on 7 June they again went to Safavion to attack the airfield, retueling over the Tsushima Strait thought to the target, on 22 June to Heaix, again retueling on the inbound log only, and on the tilt of July to Ponyang, retueling both inbound and outbound. Conpletely successful, only being hampered by bad weather, the inflight retueling missions were held to a minimum as the combat units were moved to bases on the Korean peninsula. The inflight retueling missions culminated with the 800 mile strike against the industrial targets at Chongin 5 of March 1953.

F-84s were involved in every major or operation during the final two and one half years of the aircraft in Korea. The great dam raids of the Summer of 1952, which ultimately led to total loss of all electrical power for all of North Korea and most of Marchonia, were found by SHAF and NSWMarine crews. The TH AF events were, for the most part, having F-84 Thunderjets. The May Day attack against the Ponyang Radio Station was another major action, And finally, the straw that broke the Osd of federal resistance - the attacks against the migration dams of North Korea in India 1984. These attacks by SHAF and flighters, chambers of the 5th or 6th Tungheries, demonstrated to the Reds the willingness and capability of SHAF to bring the war right to the throat door - and in start in their notes. On 27 July 1953, the Korean War ended much the same as it had begun - with Korea divided between communand democracy. But the F-84 Thunderjet had on improving further velocity. Republica's "Hog had demonstrated its ability to do the job for which it had been designed. Thunderjets had flow 86,460 series; dropped out of 50 days of bonds and 5,560 tons of angular. They had fired 22,154 cycles and turned amounts of 50 days of running. Nine MG-15s were officially excited as short by F-84 races. Another 96 were damaged or probably end down, Against these totals were eighteen Thunderjets lost to Mid Microsofters. A further 135 west down to enemy anticarfect. The Republic F-84 Thunderjet had not yet to its famous Thunder heritage.

An F-846-1 from the 116th F86p on the ramp at Tague in 1952. The 116th was the second Air Guard F-84 unit to be called up to action in the Korean War. The nose ring, tip tank rerow, and tunnels and raellows are Yellow with Blacks torn for the 196th F88a. The 116th F86p was renumbered to the 56th F86p in July 1952. (Tayf)
