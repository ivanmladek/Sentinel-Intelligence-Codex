C.202 in Comban

The first production C.202s, from the Macchi-built Seier \(I\) and _III_, were delivered in July 1941. By that time, Italy had been at war a year, a period of sharp reverses. The "new" ignites of 1939 simply couldn't hold their own against the D208s, Hurticanes and Storffes were encountered over France, England, Greece and North Africa. It was only the variant of Luffuffantile units in North Africa that broke the total Fair algorithmâ€™s hierarchy. The "demanding" for all pilots, then their oblatance C.202s, G.508 and 2.008s were assigned to secondary duties, according Stanka, colony protection and portal defense.

Over Malta

During the second half of 1941, the only force attacking Matta was the RA, all Unfrate units having been withdrawn for the attacker on Russia. At the beginning of 1942, when it became obvious that **Barbarcs** wouldn't be a quick success, the Germans returned to 1942.

### Russian Adventure

After Barbosa, Mussolini sent Italian ground and air units into Russia uninvited because he was afraid that Italy would be left out when Russia was carved up. Tiny by Eastern Front standards, the Italian air effort comprised, from the spring of 1942, 274Pingen. This unit, formerly part of 57-67horn, was composed of three, and later four, 5849C.200. When hetwain targets such as the Mid-A- and Lodato-4 were acquired, 274Pingen requested better equipment to meet the threat. All that was available as a few _Felogers_, a 51% annual airbed at Verwillongo, on the River Don, in September 1942. Those 12, and two-inch-recon models which arrived later, were distributed among all four Syadenyie.

When the Russian attacked along the Don in late Aut Autumn 1942, 274Pingen was forced into action despite terrible weather conditions. By years and the Italian fans on the Don had collapsed completely and were in full detail. Until 17 January 1943, 274Pingen kept up the pressure on the advancing Russian as best it could put, with its bases and supply lines threatened, it was pulled back to S1stain, behind the Donets. Later it fell back into Odense and finally, in May, was recalled to Italy. The 2023 hardt' been particularly active, only 17 stories being flown with no claimed videos and no losses. Nine of the _Felogers_ returned to Italy, the other five being abandoned as unservicable.

## Appendix C From C.202 to C.205

Through the first two years of its operational life, the C.202 had gone through virtually the modification. From these _WiT_ on a bullet proof sufstoresen was fitted, an auxiliary plate of amored mass that could stop a 50 cmal, Later _Foygens_ also had amor plate for the glitely head and back. The last few _Series_ had a small supplementary air intake immediately in front of the cocktail and had the neutral tube moved from the aircraft's belly in front of the bladder to position on the aircraft's stridband size. The last group had wing for two tanks to arms both then were merely carried, at that time it isert Seife had space in each wing for the mounting of a 7.7mm machine gun, but these were not often actually fitted until late in the production run. Even after _Foygens_ were delivered in the 7.7mm fingus in place, they were rarely, if ever, and became they were utterly interesting. The figures in the target American bombers of we-protected figures that were being encountered in 1994. One C.202, M.M.776, was tested out from relations, and named 0.220, but several participants's successful, M.M.89194, was tested with 2mm Maasset gun (e.g., similar to those used on multifit B109. The Italians, however, utilizing 1000 independent of performance as the German's were, and the quoils were used operations.

By late 202, the C.202 was Taglinger for superior opposition and the search for improved performance became critical. The B10601, front which is being easy as derived, was already out of no production in German. Pairs for the cameras towaniwani Italian engines fell through. Production of the RA000 _W_a-fla-home never exceeded 50 units per month, which had to be shared with B1096. This meant that airframes often had to wait for engines, forcing MacKIN to keep the C.201 production well into 1943.

A location, a more powerful engine which could be supplied in relatively large numbers led to the found Ewald logically, the B0805, the 14759m unwind 640, was chosen. A prototype taken the 1065 to the C.202 filter filter filter to the 0.59th 1942, called the C.202bis.

The only visible differences from a standard _Foygen_ were a particular halleued, fueling cylindrical cooling cooling, and the guide must monitor coolen on the _Foygen_ and a lighter lighter for the P1020 _propeller_. It predicts C.202 serial M.M.892, incorable battery battery against 2027. The second driving was M.849, free new lighter was created into production well before that first flight because of the obvious ease of transition on C.202 production lines and the justified confidence in its performance and handling. It was eventually dubbed the C.2036V, for _Nevic_ (_Gireground_). Production was authorized in the following batches:

## The Defense of Italy

The slow production of C.2028 barely allowed existing units to maintain strength. TheNevertheless, several new units re-equipped with the new no longer were brighter in temperature for the defense of the nominal, _I'6-ramp_ in Southern Italy, 1754 _"Gruppo_ in Rhode, 22 _"Gruppo_ (Scenerator) at Naples, 24 "Gruppo_ in Northern Sardinia, 22 "Gruppo_ has been from Russia and now at Florence and, finally, 3 "Gruppo_ and 150 _"Gruppo_ which their treatment is acquired _Fogonese_ before switching to the 8160, 411 free time. During the spring to 1940, the Allies began in the air shortly used lead to the 1940s of Italy, 1754/m, based at Panteliera, new with Verros, opened the action on 20 April 143 when 20 C.205 days is turned to agree on nearly 80 minutes and 938, claiming 16 for the loss of one. Fring the best flight in the area, 1754/m controlled the local airspace overarching the allies launched as all-out aerial scans on the island of the end of May, totally overwhelming the detectors. For probably the only time in history, an island was bombed to its underwater, 1754/m generated to Silicon, 1517/m. Fringbo was wiped out and on 11 June, Panteliera surmounted without being invaded.

The limited bomber of these against strategic targets in Italy and Southern Germany continued unadapted throughout this period. Fighters with their relatively faintly turned the most little effect on the Armen bomber systems. Italian pilots found that the only evolved some the defensive life of the bomber's was by head on attacks, which the Fogonese twin 50s could do little damage in the brief firing allowed by that form of attack. The only successes that the RA could claim against USAAF heavy bombers were against solitary stragglers. Such was the desperation of the RA that it tried C.200s dropping altitude/long bombs, without any success. The new cannon-armed Re.2005 and C.205s proved much more effective, but they were never available in numerous large enough to make a difference.

In preparation of the invasion of Sicily in July, massive Allied flights struck at all Italian airfiles, demoliting over 1000 A aftercut the ground during the months before Operation Twisty. When the Allies are on July 1943, the RA have in all the forces it had. The attrition of Sitka, 650 and Re.2002 attack arrest textile. Within days there are virtually enough care for it continue the suicidal attacks on the invasion fleet. "I'6-ramp_, 24 _"Gruppo_ at Christian and Christian" and 1754/m." Grapp at Palomar represented the only 202 units in the island. They were found over the island by 3754/m for Connetereter and a dozen 517/m."

On 12 July, an unidentified _"Edonge" strategic the launch bringing General George Patton above, but was brought down by flash when it turned for a second pass.

With 10 days, all flight units had been forced to withdraw from Sicily, unable to protect even their own passes. The island in mid-August without much further RA support. Through the rest of the summer, the _"RA_ kept putting Fogonese and Verros into the air over Southern Italy with generally poor results, Only 517/m."
