# 5 Ways to Speed Up Nougat PDF Extraction

Based on an analysis of the project structure and the provided files, here are five ways to speed up the prediction phase, ordered from easiest to most complex to implement:

### 1. Increase Batch Size

The most straightforward way to speed up inference is to increase the batch size, which allows the model to process more images in parallel. This is especially effective when using a GPU.

*   **How to do it:** Use the `--batchsize` or `-b` flag when running the prediction script.
*   **Example:**
    ```bash
    # Before (default batch size might be small)
    python predict.py --glob "documents/*.pdf"

    # After (with a larger batch size)
    python predict.py --glob "documents/*.pdf" --batchsize 32
    ```
*   **Trade-off:** A larger batch size requires more GPU memory. If you encounter "Out of Memory" errors, you'll need to reduce the batch size.

### 2. Use Parallel Data Loading

The `predict.py` script uses a `torch.utils.data.DataLoader` to load and preprocess data. By default, it might not be using multiple worker processes. You can specify the number of workers to parallelize data loading, which is particularly useful if you have a fast GPU that can process data quicker than it can be loaded from disk.

*   **How to do it:** This requires a small modification to the `predict.py` file. Find the `DataLoader` instantiation and add the `num_workers` argument.
*   **File to modify:** `predict.py`
*   **Code change:**
    ```python
    # In predict.py, find this line:
    dataloader = torch.utils.data.DataLoader(
        ConcatDataset(datasets),
        batch_size=args.batchsize,
        shuffle=False,
        collate_fn=LazyDataset.ignore_none_collate,
    )

    # And change it to this:
    dataloader = torch.utils.data.DataLoader(
        ConcatDataset(datasets),
        batch_size=args.batchsize,
        shuffle=False,
        collate_fn=LazyDataset.ignore_none_collate,
        num_workers=4, # Adjust this number based on your CPU cores
    )
    ```
*   **Trade-off:** This increases CPU usage. The optimal number of workers depends on your system's CPU and I/O capabilities.

### 3. Reduce Input Image Size

The model processes images that have been resized to a fixed `input_size`. Using a smaller input size can significantly speed up inference because there are fewer pixels to process.

*   **How to do it:** Use the `--input_size` flag to specify a smaller height and width.
*   **Example:**
    ```bash
    # Default might be higher, e.g., 896x672
    # Using a smaller input size
    python predict.py --glob "documents/*.pdf" --input_size 512 512
    ```
*   **Trade-off:** Smaller images can lead to a decrease in accuracy, as important details might be lost during the resizing process. It's a trade-off between speed and quality.

### 4. Enable Caching for Preprocessing

The `LazyDataset` class processes PDF files on the fly. This involves reading the PDF, rasterizing each page to an image, and then preparing it for the model. This can be time-consuming, especially for large PDFs. By adding a caching layer, you can save the processed images to disk and reuse them in subsequent runs.

*   **How to do it:** This requires modifying the `LazyDataset` class in your project's `nougat/utils/dataset.py` file.
*   **Conceptual Code Change (in `nougat/utils/dataset.py`):**
    ```python
    # In LazyDataset class
    def __getitem__(self, idx):
        # ... (existing code)
        image_path = self.get_cache_path(idx) # Implement this method

        if os.path.exists(image_path):
            image = Image.open(image_path)
        else:
            # ... (existing code to rasterize and prepare image)
            image.save(image_path) # Save the processed image

        # ... (rest of the method)
    ```
*   **Trade-off:** This will use more disk space to store the cached images. You'll also need to manage the cache, for example, by clearing it when the input data changes.

### 5. Use Quantization

Quantization is a technique that can significantly speed up inference by reducing the precision of the model's weights (e.g., from 32-bit floating-point to 8-bit integer). This can lead to faster computations, especially on CPUs, and can also reduce the model's memory footprint.

*   **How to do it:** This is a more involved process. You would typically use a library like `torch.quantization` to apply quantization to your model.
*   **Conceptual Steps:**
    1.  **Fuse Modules:** Combine layers like convolution and batch normalization.
    2.  **Add Quantization Stubs:** Insert `QuantStub` and `DeQuantStub` layers to control the flow of quantized tensors.
    3.  **Calibrate the Model:** Run the model on a representative dataset to collect statistics for quantization.
    4.  **Convert to Quantized Model:** Convert the calibrated model to a quantized version.
*   **Example Snippet (for illustration):**
    ```python
    import torch
    from torch.quantization import quantize_dynamic

    # Assuming 'model' is your loaded Nougat model
    quantized_model = quantize_dynamic(model, {torch.nn.Linear}, dtype=torch.qint8)

    # Now use 'quantized_model' for inference
    ```
*   **Trade-off:** Quantization can lead to a small drop in accuracy. It's important to evaluate the quantized model on a validation set to ensure the performance is still acceptable.
