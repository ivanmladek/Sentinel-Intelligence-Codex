# Offline Batch Inference Cost Optimization Proposal

## Core Strategy
Prioritize cost reduction above all else by leveraging the 24-hour window tolerance and accepting failure as an option. Unlike real-time systems where uptime is critical, batch inference allows us to use the cheapest possible resources even if they fail occasionally, with robust retry mechanisms.

## Key Cost-Saving Approaches

### 1. Spot/Preemptible Instance Strategy
- Use 100% [preemptible VMs on GCP](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/preemptible) (up to 91% cheaper than on-demand)
- Implement automatic job checkpointing every 15 minutes to minimize rework when instances are terminated
- Design pipeline to resume from last checkpoint rather than restarting entire job
- Use [GCP's batch service](https://cloud.google.com/batch/docs) which automatically manages spot instance allocation and retries

### 2. GPU Optimization
- Use [T4 GPUs](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/gpus) instead of A100s (60-70% cost reduction) with appropriate model quantization
- Implement dynamic batching based on current GPU memory availability
- Use [model distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1503.02531) to create smaller, faster models specifically for batch processing
- Apply [8-bit quantization](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/quantization/bitsandbytes) to reduce memory requirements by 50%

### 3. Workload Management
- Implement [progressive sampling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_sampling): start with small subset to validate pipeline before scaling
- Use [priority queues](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/push#receiving_messages_in_order) to process high-value data first
- Implement [exponential backoff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_backoff) for retries of failed jobs
- Design system to tolerate up to 30% instance termination rate without significant delay

### 4. Storage Optimization
- Use [Cloud Storage transfer service](https://cloud.google.com/storage-transfer-service) for cost-effective data movement
- Store intermediate results in [Cloud Storage Archive class](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/storage-classes#archive) (80% cheaper than standard)
- Implement data deduplication before processing to avoid redundant computations
- Use [columnar storage formats](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/data-analytics/columnar-storage-bigquery) for structured output

## Infrastructure Design

### GCP-Based Architecture
```
[Input Data] → [Cloud Storage Standard]
       ↓
[Cloud Scheduler] → [Cloud Functions (orchestrator)]
       ↓
[Pub/Sub Topic] → [Cloud Run Jobs (preprocessing)]
       ↓
[Pub/Sub Topic] → [Batch Service (GPU inference)]
       ↓
[Cloud Storage Archive] → [BigQuery (final results)]
```

### Cost Breakdown Comparison
| Component | Standard Approach | Cost-Optimized Approach | Savings |
|-----------|-------------------|-------------------------|---------|
| Compute | 100x A100 GPUs (on-demand) | 100x T4 GPUs (preemptible) | 89% |
| Storage | Standard class throughout | Archive class for intermediates | 80% |
| Data Transfer | Direct processing | Deduplicated input | 30-60% |
| Failure Handling | No retries | Checkpointing + exponential backoff | 40% less wasted compute |

## Implementation Roadmap

1. DONE: Analyze data characteristics and model requirements
2. DONE: Design quantization/distillation strategy
3. IN PROGRESS: Implement checkpointing system
4. PENDING: Configure preemptible instance pool with retry logic
5. PENDING: Set up storage tiering strategy
6. PENDING: Implement data deduplication pipeline

This approach leverages the 24-hour window to absorb instance terminations while focusing exclusively on minimizing cost per successful inference. By accepting that some jobs will fail and designing the system to handle this gracefully, we achieve the maximum possible cost reduction without compromising final output quality.
